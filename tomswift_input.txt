CHAPTER I.

A NARROW ESCAPE


"That's the way to do it! Whoop her up, Andy! Shove the spark lever
over, and turn on more gasolene! We'll make a record this trip."

Two lads in the tonneau of a touring car, that was whirling along a
country road, leaned forward to speak to the one at the steering
wheel. The latter was a red-haired youth, with somewhat squinty
eyes, and not a very pleasant face, but his companions seemed to
regard him with much favor. Perhaps it was because they were riding
in his automobile.

"Whoop her up, Andy!" added the lad on the seat beside the driver.
"This is immense!"

"I rather thought you'd like it," remarked Andy Foger, as he turned
the car to avoid a stone in the road. "I'll make things hum around
Shopton!"

"You have made them hum already, Andy," commented the lad beside
him. "My ears are ringing. Wow! There goes my cap!"

As the boy spoke, the breeze, created by the speed at which the car
was traveling, lifted off his cap, and sent it whirling to the rear.

Andy Foger turned for an instant's glance behind. Then he opened the
throttle still wider, and exclaimed:

"Let it go, Sam. We can get another. I want to see what time I can
make to Mansburg! I want to break a record, if I can."

"Look out, or you'll break something else!" cried a lad on the rear
seat. "There's a fellow on a bicycle just ahead of us. Take care,
Andy!"

"Let him look out for himself," retorted Foger, as he bent lower
over the steering wheel, for the car was now going at a terrific
rate. The youth on the bicycle was riding slowly along, and did not
see the approaching automobile until it was nearly upon him. Then,
with a mean grin, Andy Foger pressed the rubber bulb of the horn
with sudden energy, sending out a series of alarming blasts.

"It's Tom Swift!" cried Sam Snedecker. "Look out, or you'll run him
down!"

"Let him keep out of my way," retorted Andy savagely.

The youth on the wheel, with a sudden spurt of speed, tried to cross
the highway. He did manage to do it, but by such a narrow margin
that in very terror Andy Foger shut off the power, jammed down the
brakes and steered to one side. So suddenly was he obliged to swerve
over that the ponderous machine skidded and went into the ditch at
the side of the road, where it brought up, tilting to one side.

Tom Swift, his face rather pale from his narrow escape, leaped from
his bicycle, and stood regarding the automobile. As for the
occupants of that machine, from Andy Foger, the owner, to the three
cronies who were riding with him, they all looked very much
astonished.

"Are we--is it damaged any, Andy?" asked Sam Snedecker.

"I hope not," growled Andy. "If my car's hurt it's Tom Swift's
fault!"

He leaped from his seat and made a hurried inspection of the
machine. He found nothing the matter, though it was more from good
luck than good management. Then Andy turned and looked savagely at
Tom Swift. The latter, standing his wheel up against the fence,
walked forward.

"What do you mean by getting in the way like that?" demanded Andy
with a scowl. "Don't you see that you nearly upset me?"

"Well, I like your nerve, Andy Foger!" cried Tom. "What do you mean
by nearly running me down? Why didn't you sound your horn? You
automobilists take too much for granted! You were going faster than
the legal rate, anyhow!"

"I was, eh?" sneered Andy.

"Yes, you were, and you know it. I'm the one to make a kick, not
you. You came pretty near hitting me. Me getting in your way! I
guess I've got some rights on the road!"

"Aw, go on!" growled Andy, for he could think of nothing else to
say. "Bicycles are a back number, anyhow."

"It isn't so very long ago that you had one," retorted Tom. "First
you fellows know, you'll be pulled in for speeding."

"I guess we had better go slower, Andy," advised Sam in a low voice.
"I don't want to be arrested."

"Leave this to me," retorted Andy. "I'm running this tour. The next
time you get in my way I'll run you down!" he threatened Tom. "Come
on, fellows, we're late now, and can't make a record run, all on
account of him," and Andy got back into the car, followed by his
cronies, who had hurriedly alighted after their thrilling stop.

"If you try anything like this again you'll wish you hadn't,"
declared Tom, and he watched the automobile party ride off.

"Oh, forget it!" snapped back Andy, and he laughed, his companions
joining.

Tom Swift said nothing in reply. Slowly he remounted his wheel and
rode off, but his thoughts toward Andy Foger were not very pleasant
ones. Andy was the son of a wealthy man of the town, and his good
fortune in the matter of money seemed to have spoiled him, for he
was a bully and a coward. Several times he and Tom Swift had
clashed, for Andy was overbearing. But this was the first time Andy
had shown such a vindictive spirit.

"He thinks he can run over everything since he got his new auto,"
commented Tom aloud as he rode on. "He'll have a smash-up some day,
if he isn't careful. He's too fond of speeding. I wonder where he
and his crowd are going?"

Musing over his narrow escape Tom rode on, and was soon at his home,
where he lived with his widowed father, Barton Swift, a wealthy
inventor, and the latter's housekeeper, Mrs. Baggert. Approaching a
machine shop, one of several built near his house by Mr. Swift, in
which he conducted experiments and constructed apparatus. Tom was
met by his parent.

"What's the matter, Tom?" asked Mr. Swift. "You look as if something
had happened."

"Something very nearly did," answered the youth, and related his
experience on the road.

"Humph," remarked the inventor; "your little pleasure-jaunt might
have ended disastrously. I suppose Andy and his chums are off on
their trip. I remember Mr. Foger speaking to me about it the other
day. He said Andy and some companions were going on a tour, to be
gone a week or more. Well, I'm glad it was no worse. But have you
anything special to do, Tom?"

"No; I was just riding for pleasure, and if you want me to do
anything, I'm ready."

"Then I wish you'd take this letter to Mansburg for me. I want it
registered, and I don't wish to mail it in the Shopton post-office.
It's too important, for it's about a valuable invention."

"The new turbine motor, dad?"

"That's it. And on your way I wish you'd stop in Merton's machine
shop and get some bolts he's making for me."

"I will. Is that the letter?" and Tom extended his hand for a
missive his father held.

"Yes. Please be careful of it. It's to my lawyers in Washington
regarding the final steps in getting a patent for the turbine.
That's why I'm so particular about not wanting it mailed here.
Several times before I have posted letters here, only to have the
information contained in them leak out before my attorneys received
them. I do not want that to happen in this case. Another thing;
don't speak about my new invention in Merton's shop when you stop
for the bolts."

"Why, do you think he gave out information concerning your work?"

"Well, not exactly. He might not mean to, but he told me the other
day that some strangers were making inquiries of him, about whether
he ever did any work for me."

"What did he tell them?"

"He said that he occasionally did, but that most of my inventive
work was done in my own shops, here. He wanted to know why the men
were asking such questions, and one of them said they expected to
open a machine shop soon, and wanted to ascertain if they might
figure on getting any of my trade. But I don't believe that was
their object."

"What do you think it was?"

"I don't know, exactly, but I was somewhat alarmed when I heard this
from Merton. So I am going to take no risks. That's why I send this
letter to Mansburg. Don't lose it, and don't forget about the bolts.
Here is a blue-print of them, so you can see if they come up to the
specifications."

Tom rode off on his wheel, and was soon spinning down the road.

"I wonder if I'll meet Andy Foger and his cronies again?" he
thought. "Not very likely to, I guess, if they're off on a tour.
Well, I'm just as well satisfied. He and I always seem to get into
trouble when we meet." Tom was not destined to meet Andy again that
day, but the time was to come when the red-haired bully was to cause
Tom Swift no little trouble, and get him into danger besides. So Tom
rode along, thinking over what his father had said to him about the
letter he carried.

Mr. Barton Swift was a natural inventor. From a boy he had been
interested in things mechanical, and one of his first efforts had
been to arrange a system of pulleys, belts and gears so that the
windmill would operate the churn in the old farmhouse where he was
born. The fact that the mill went so fast that it broke the churn
all to pieces did not discourage him, and he at once set to work,
changing the gears. His father had to buy a new churn, but the young
inventor made his plan work on the second trial, and thereafter his
mother found butter-making easy.

From then on Barton Swift lived in a world of inventions. People
used to say he would never amount to anything, that inventors never
did, but Mr. Swift proved them all wrong by amassing a considerable
fortune out of his many patents. He grew up, married and had one
son, Tom. Mrs. Barton died when Tom was three years old, and since
then he had lived with his father and a succession of nurses and
housekeepers. The last woman to have charge of the household was a
Mrs. Baggert, a motherly widow, and she succeeded so well, and Tom
and his father formed such an attachment for her, that she was
regarded as a fixture, and had now been in charge ten years.

Mr. Swift and his son lived in a handsome house on the outskirts of
the village of Shopton, in New York State. The village was near a
large body of water, which I shall call Lake Carlopa, and there Tom
and his father used to spend many pleasant days boating, for Tom and
the inventor were better chums than many boys are, and they were
often seen together in a craft rowing about, or fishing. Of course
Tom had some boy friends, but he went with his father more often
than he did with them.

Though many of Mr. Swift's inventions paid him well, he was
constantly seeking to perfect others. To this end he had built near
his home several machine shops, with engines, lathes and apparatus
for various kinds of work. Tom, too, had the inventive fever in his
veins, and had planned some useful implements and small machines.

Along the pleasant country roads on a fine day in April rode Tom
Swift on his way to Mansburg to register the letter. As he descended
a little hill he saw, some distance away, but coming toward him, a
great cloud of dust.

"Somebody must be driving a herd of cattle along the road," thought
Tom. "I hope they don't get in my way, or, rather, I hope I don't
get in theirs. Guess I'd better keep to one side, yet there isn't
any too much room."

The dust-cloud came nearer. It was so dense that whoever or whatever
was making it could not be distinguished.

"Must be a lot of cattle in that bunch," mused the young inventor,
"but I shouldn't think they'd trot them so on a warm day like this.
Maybe they're stampeded. If they are I've got to look out." This
idea caused him some alarm.

He tried to peer through the dust-cloud, but could not. Nearer and
nearer it came. Tom kept on, taking care to get as far to the side
of the road as he could. Then from the midst of the enveloping mass
came the sound of a steady "chug-chug."

"It's a motor-cycle!" exclaimed Tom. "He must have his muffler wide
open, and that's kicking up as much dust as the wheels do. Whew! But
whoever's on it will look like a clay image at the end of the line!"

Now that he knew it was a fellow-cyclist who was raising such a
disturbance, Tom turned more toward the middle of the road. As yet
he had not had a sight of the rider, but the explosions of the motor
were louder. Suddenly, when the first advancing particles of dust
reached him, almost making him sneeze, Tom caught sight of the
rider. He was a man of middle age, and he was clinging to the
handle-bars of the machine. The motor was going at full speed.

Tom quickly turned to one side, to avoid the worst of the dust. The
motor-cyclist glanced at the youth, but this act nearly proved
disastrous for him. He took his eyes from the road ahead for just a
moment, and he did not see a large stone directly in his path. His
front wheel hit it, and the heavy machine, which he could not
control very well, skidded over toward the lad on the bicycle. The
motor-cyclist bounced up in the air from the saddle, and nearly lost
his hold on the handle-bars.

"Look out!" cried Tom. "You'll smash into me!"

"I'm--I'm--try--ing--not--to!" were the words that were rattled out
of the middle-aged man.

Tom gave his wheel a desperate twist to get out of the way. The
motor-cyclist tried to do the same, but the machine he was on
appeared to want matters its own way. He came straight for Tom, and
a disastrous collision might have resulted had not another stone
been in the way. The front wheel hit this, and was swerved to one
side. The motor-cycle flashed past Tom, just grazing his wheel, and
then was lost to sight beyond in a cloud of dust that seemed to
follow it like a halo.

"Why don't you learn to ride before you come out on the road!" cried
Tom somewhat angrily.

Like an echo from the dust-cloud came floating back these words:

"I'm--try--ing--to!" Then the sound of the explosions became
fainter.

"Well, he's got lots to learn yet!" exclaimed Tom. "That's twice
to-day I've nearly been run down. I expect I'd better look out for the
third time. They say that's always fatal," and the lad leaped from his
wheel. "Wonder if he bent any of my spokes?" the young inventor
continued as he inspected his bicycle.




CHAPTER II.

TOM OVERHEARS SOMETHING


"Everything seems to be all right," Tom remarked, "but another inch
or so and he'd have crashed into me. I wonder who he was? I wish I
had a machine like that. I could make better time than I can on my
bicycle. Perhaps I'll get one some day. Well, I might as well ride
on."

Tom was soon at Mansburg, and going to the post-office handed in the
letter for registry. Bearing in mind his father's words, he looked
about to see if there were any suspicious characters, but the only
person he noticed was a well-dressed man, with a black mustache, who
seemed to be intently studying the schedule of the arrival and
departure of the mails.

"Do you want the receipt for the registered letter sent to you here
or at Shopton?" asked the clerk of Tom. "Come to think of it,
though, it will have to come here, and you can call for it. I'll
have it returned to Mr. Barton Swift, care of general delivery, and
you can get it the next time you are over," for the clerk knew Tom.

"That will do," answered our hero, and as he turned away from the
window he saw that the man who had been inquiring about the mails
was regarding him curiously. Tom thought nothing of it at the time,
but there came an occasion when he wished that he had taken more
careful note of the well-dressed individual. As the youth passed out
of the outer door he saw the man walk over to the registry window.

"He seems to have considerable mail business," thought Tom, and then
the matter passed from his mind as he mounted his wheel and hurried
to the machine shop.

"Say, I'm awfully sorry," announced Mr. Merton when Tom said he had
come for the bolts, "but they're not quite done. They need
polishing. I know I promised them to your father to-day, and he can
have them, but he was very particular about the polish, and as one
of my best workers was taken sick, I'm a little behind."

"How long will it take to polish them?" asked Tom.

"Oh, about an hour. In fact, a man is working on them now. If you
could call this afternoon they'll be ready. Can you?"

"I s'pose I've got to," replied Tom good-naturedly. "Guess I'll have
to stay in Mansburg for dinner. I can't get back to Shopton in time
now."

"I'll be sure to have them for you after dinner," promised Mr.
Merton. "Now, there's a matter I want to speak to you about, Tom.
Has your father any idea of giving the work he has been turning over
to me to some other firm?"

"Not that I know of. Why?" and the lad showed his wonder.

"Well, I'll tell you why. Some time ago there was a stranger in
here, asking about your father's work. I told Mr. Swift of it at the
time. The stranger said then that he and some others were thinking
of opening a machine shop, and he wanted to find out whether they
would be likely to get any jobs from your father. I told the man I
knew nothing about Mr. Swift's business, and he went away. I didn't
hear any more of it, though of course I didn't want to lose your
father's trade. Now a funny thing happened. Only this morning the
same man was back here, and he was making particular inquiries about
your father's private machine shops."

"He was?" exclaimed Tom excitedly.

"Yes. He wanted to know where they were located, how they were laid
out, and what sort of work he did in them."

"What did you tell him?"

"Nothing at all. I suspected something, and I said the best way for
him to find out would be to go and see your father. Wasn't that
right?"

"Sure. Dad doesn't want his business known any more than he can
help. What do you suppose they wanted?"

"Well, the man talked as though he and his partners would like to
buy your father's shops."

"I don't believe he'd sell. He has them arranged just for his own
use in making patents, and I'm sure he would not dispose of them."

"Well, that's what I thought, but I didn't tell the man so. I judged
it would be best for him to find out for himself."

"What was the man's name?"

"He didn't tell me, and I didn't ask him."

"How did he look?"

"Well, he was well dressed, wore kid gloves and all that, and he had
a little black mustache."

Tom started, and Mr. Merton noticed it.

"Do you know him?" he asked.

"No," replied Tom, "but I saw--" Then he stopped. He recalled the
man he had seen in the post-office. He answered this description,
but it was too vague to be certain.

"Did you say you'd seen him?" asked Mr. Merton, regarding Tom
curiously.

"No--yes--that is--well, I'll tell my father about it," stammered
Tom, who concluded that it would be best to say nothing of his
suspicions. "I'll be back right after dinner, Mr. Merton. Please
have the bolts ready for me, if you can."

"I will. Is your father going to use them in a new machine?"

"Yes; dad is always making new machines," answered the youth, as the
most polite way of not giving the proprietor of the shop any
information. "I'll be back right after dinner," he called as he went
out to get on his wheel.

Tom was much puzzled. He felt certain that the man in the post-office
and the one who had questioned Mr. Merton were the same.

"There is something going on, that dad should know about," reflected
Tom. "I must tell him. I don't believe it will be wise to send any
more of his patent work over to Merton. We must do it in the shops
at home, and dad and I will have to keep our eyes open. There may be
spies about seeking to discover something about his new turbine
motor. I'll hurry back with those bolts and tell dad. But first I
must get lunch. I'll go to the restaurant and have a good feed while
I'm at it."

Tom had plenty of spending money, some of which came from a small
patent he had marketed himself. He left his wheel outside the
restaurant, first taking the precaution to chain the wheels, and
then went inside. Tom was hungry and ordered a good meal. He was
about half way through it when some one called his name.

"Hello, Ned!" he answered, looking up to see a youth about his own
age. "Where did you blow in from?"

"Oh, I came over from Shopton this morning," replied Ned Newton,
taking a seat at the table with Tom. The two lads were chums, and in
their younger days had often gone fishing, swimming and hunting
together. Now Ned worked in the Shopton bank, and Tom was so busy
helping his father, so they did not see each other so often.

"On business or pleasure?" asked Tom, putting some more sugar in his
coffee.

"Business. I had to bring some papers over from our bank to the
First National here. But what about you?"

"Oh, I came on dad's account."

"Invented anything new?" asked Ned as he gave his order to the
waitress.

"No, nothing since the egg-beater I was telling you about. But I'm
working on some things."

"Why don't you invent an automobile or an airship?"

"Maybe I will some day, but, speaking of autos, did you see the one
Andy Foger has?"

"Yes; it's a beaut! Have you seen it?"

"Altogether at too close range. He nearly ran over me this morning,"
and the young inventor related the occurrence.

"Oh, Andy always was too fresh," commented Ned; "and since his
father let him get the touring car I suppose he'll be worse than
ever."

"Well, if he tries to run me down again he'll get into trouble,"
declared Tom, calling for a second cup of coffee.

The two chums began conversing on more congenial topics, and Ned was
telling of a new camera he had, when, from a table directly behind
him, Tom heard some one say in rather loud tones:

"The plant is located in Shopton, all right, and the buildings are
near Swift's house."

Tom started, and listened more intently.

"That will make it more difficult," one man answered. "But if the
invention is as valuable as--"

"Hush!" came a caution from another of the party. "This is too
public a place to discuss the matter. Wait until we get out. One of
us will have to see Swift, of course, and if he proves stubborn--"

"I guess you'd better hush yourself," retorted the man who had first
spoken, and then the voices subsided.

But Tom Swift had overheard something which made him vaguely afraid.
He started so at the sound of his father's name that he knocked a
fork from the table.

"What's the matter; getting nervous?" asked Ned with a laugh.

"I guess so," replied Tom, and when he stooped to pick the fork up,
not waiting for the girl who was serving at his table, he stole a
look at the strangers who had just entered. He was startled to note
that one of the men was the same he had seen in the post-office--the
man who answered the description of the one who had been inquiring
of Mr. Merton about the Swift shops.

"I'm going to keep my ears open," thought Tom as he went on eating
his dinner.




CHAPTER III.

IN A SMASH-UP


Though the young inventor listened intently, in an endeavor to hear
the conversation of the men at the table behind him, all he could
catch was an indistinct murmur. The strangers appeared to have
heeded the caution of one of their number and were speaking in low
tones.

Tom and Ned finished their meal, and started to leave the
restaurant. As Mr. Swift's son passed the table where the men sat
they looked up quickly at him. Two of them gave Tom but a passing
glance, but one--he whom the young inventor had noticed in the
post-office--stared long and intently.

"I think he will know me the next time he sees me," thought Tom, and
he boldly returned the glance of the stranger.

The bolts were ready when the inventor's son called at the machine
shop a second time, and making a package of them Tom fastened it to
the saddle of his bicycle. He started for home at a fast pace, and
was just turning from a cross road into the main highway when he saw
ahead of him a woman driving a light wagon. As the sun flashed on
Tom's shining wheel the horse gave a sudden leap, swerved to one
side, and then bolted down the dusty stretch, the woman screaming at
the top of her voice.

"A runaway!" cried Tom; "and partly my fault, too!"

Waiting not an instant the lad bent over his handle-bars and pedaled
with all his force. His bicycle seemed fairly to leap forward after
the galloping horse.

"Sit still! Don't jump out! Don't jump!" yelled the young inventor.
"I'll try to catch him!" for the woman was standing up in front of
the seat and leaning forward, as if about to leap from the wagon.

"She's lost her head," thought Tom. "No wonder! That's a skittish
horse."

Faster and faster he rode, bending all his energies to overtake the
animal. The wagon was swaying from side to side, and more than once
the woman just saved herself from being thrown out by grasping the
edge of the seat. She found that her standing position was a
dangerous one and crouched on the bottom of the swaying vehicle.

"That's better!" shouted Tom, but it is doubtful if she heard him,
for the rattling of the wagon and the hoofbeats of the horse drowned
all other sounds. "Sit still!" he shouted. "I'll stop the horse for
you!"

Trying to imagine himself in a desperate race, in order to excite
himself to greater speed, Tom continued on. He was now even with the
tail-board of the wagon, and slowly creeping up. The woman was all
huddled up in a lump.

"Grab the reins! Grab the reins!" shouted Tom. "Saw on the bit! That
will stop him!"

The occupant of the wagon turned to look at the lad. Tom saw that
she was a handsome young lady. "Grab the reins!" he cried again.
"Pull hard!"

"I--I can't!" she answered frightenedly. "They have dropped down!
Oh, do please stop the horse! I'm so--so frightened!"

"I'll stop him!" declared the youth firmly, and he set his teeth
hard. Then he saw the reason the fair driver could not grasp the
lines. They had slipped over the dashboard and were trailing on the
ground.

The horse was slacking speed a bit now, for the pace was telling on
his wind. Tom saw his opportunity, and with a sudden burst of energy
was at the animal's head. Steering his wheel with one hand, with the
other the lad made a grab for the reins near the bit. The horse
swerved frightenedly to one side, but Tom swung in the same
direction. He grasped the leather and then, with a kick, he freed
himself from the bicycle, giving it a shove to one side. He was now
clinging to the reins with both hands, and, being a muscular lad and
no lightweight, his bulk told.

"Sit--still!" panted our hero to the young woman, who had arisen to
the seat. "I'll have him stopped in half a minute now!"

It was in less time than that, for the horse, finding it impossible
to shake off the grip of Tom, began to slow from a gallop to a trot,
then to a canter, and finally to a slow walk. A moment later the
horse had stopped, breathing heavily from his run.

"There, there, now!" spoke Tom soothingly. "You're all right, old
fellow. I hope you're not hurt"--this to the young lady--and Tom
made a motion to raise his cap, only to find that it had blown off.

"Oh, no--no; I'm more frightened than hurt."

"It was all my fault," declared the young inventor. "I should not
have swung into the road so suddenly. My bicycle alarmed your
horse."

"Oh, I fancy Dobbin is easily disturbed," admitted the fair driver.
"I can't thank you enough for stopping him. You saved me from a bad
accident."

"It was the least I could do. Are you all right now?" and he handed
up the dangling reins. "I think Dobbin, as you call him, has had
enough of running," went on Tom, for the horse was now quiet.

"I hope so. Yes, I am all right. I trust your wheel is not damaged.
If it is, my father, Mr. Amos Nestor, of Mansburg, will gladly pay
for its repair."

This reminded the young inventor of his bicycle, and making sure
that the horse would not start up again, he went to where his wheel
and his cap lay. He found that the only damage to the bicycle was a
few bent spokes, and, straightening them and having again apologized
to the young woman, receiving in turn her pardon and thanks, and
learning that her name was Mary Nestor, Tom once more resumed his
trip. The wagon followed him at a distance, the horse evincing no
desire now to get out of a slow amble.

"Well, things are certainly happening to me to-day," mused Tom as he
pedaled on. "That might have been a serious runaway if there'd been
anything in the road."

Tom did not stop to think that he had been mainly instrumental in
preventing a bad accident, as he had been the innocent cause of
starting the runaway, but Tom was ever a modest lad. His arms were
wrenched from jerking on the bridle, but he did not mind that much,
and bent over the handle-bars to make up for lost time.

Our hero was within a short distance of his house and was coasting
easily along when, just ahead of him, he saw a cloud of dust, very
similar to the one that had, some time before, concealed the
inexperienced motor-cyclist.

"I wonder if that's him again?" thought Tom. "If it is I'm going to
hang back until I see which way he's headed. No use running any more
risks."

Almost at that moment a puff of wind blew some of the dust to one
side. Tom had a glimpse of the man on the puffing machine.

"It's the same chap!" he exclaimed aloud; "and he's going the same
way I am. Well, I'll not try to catch up to him. I wonder what he's
been doing all this while, that he hasn't gotten any farther than
this? Either he's been riding back and forth, or else he's been
resting. My, but he certainly is scooting along!"

The wind carried to Tom the sound of the explosions of the motor,
and he could see the man clinging tightly to the handle-bars. The
rider was almost in front of Tom's house now, when, with a
suddenness that caused the lad to utter an exclamation of alarm, the
stranger turned his machine right toward a big oak tree.

"What's he up to?" cried Tom excitedly. "Does he think he can climb
that, or is he giving an exhibition by showing how close he can come
and not hit it?"

A moment later the motor-cyclist struck the tree a glancing blow.
The man went flying over the handle-bars, the machine was shunted to
the ditch along the road, and falling over on one side the motor
raced furiously. The rider lay in a heap at the foot of the tree.

"My, that was a smash!" cried Tom. "He must be killed!" and bending
forward, he raced toward the scene of the accident.




CHAPTER IV.

TOM AND A MOTOR-CYCLE


When Tom reached the prostrate figure on the grass at the foot of
the old oak tree, the youth bent quickly over the man. There was an
ugly cut on his head, and blood was flowing from it. But Tom quickly
noticed that the stranger was breathing, though not very strongly.

"Well, he's not dead--just yet!" exclaimed the youth with a sigh of
relief. "But I guess he's pretty badly hurt. I must get help--no,
I'll take him into our house. It's not far. I'll call dad."

Leaning his wheel against the tree Tom started for his home, about
three hundred feet away, and then he noticed that the stranger's
motor-cycle was running at full speed on the ground.

"Guess I'd better shut off the power!" he exclaimed. "No use letting
the machine be ruined." Tom had a natural love for machinery, and it
hurt him almost as much to see a piece of fine apparatus abused as
it did to see an animal mistreated. It was the work of a
moment to shut off the gasolene and spark, and then the youth raced
on toward his house.

"Where's dad?" he called to Mrs. Baggert, who was washing the
dishes.

"Out in one of the shops," replied the housekeeper. "Why, Tom," she
went on hurriedly as she saw how excited he was, "whatever has
happened?"

"Man hurt--out in front--motor-cycle smash--I'm going to bring him
in here--get some things ready--I'll find dad!"

"Bless and save us!" cried Mrs. Baggert. "Whatever are we coming to?
Who's hurt? How did it happen? Is he dead?"

"Haven't time to talk now!" answered Tom, rushing from the house.
"Dad and I will bring him in here."

Tom found his father in one of the three small machine shops on the
grounds about the Swift home. The youth hurriedly told what had
happened.

"Of course we'll bring him right in here!" assented Mr. Swift,
putting aside the work upon which he was engaged. "Did you tell Mrs.
Baggert?"

"Yes, and she's all excited."

"Well, she can't help it, being a woman, I suppose. But we'll
manage. Do you know the man?"

"Never saw him before to-day, when he tried to run me down. Guess he
doesn't know much about motor-cycles. But come on, dad. He may bleed
to death."

Father and son hurried to where the stranger lay. As they bent over
him he opened his eyes and asked faintly:

"Where am I? What happened?"

"You're all right--in good hands," said Mr. Swift. "Are you much
hurt?"

"Not much--mostly stunned, I guess. What happened?" he repeated.

"You and your motor-cycle tried to climb a tree," remarked Tom with
grim humor.

"Oh, yes, I remember now. I couldn't seem to steer out of the way.
And I couldn't shut off the power in time. Is the motor-cycle much
damaged?"

"The front wheel is," reported Tom, after an inspection, "and there
are some other breaks, but I guess--"

"I wish it was all smashed!" exclaimed the man vigorously. "I never
want to see it again!"

"Why, don't you like it?" asked Tom eagerly.

"No, and I never will," the man spoke faintly but determinedly.

"Never mind now," interposed Mr. Swift. "Don't excite yourself. My
son and I will take you to our house and send for a doctor."

"I'll bring the motor-cycle, after we've carried you in," added Tom.

"Don't worry about the machine. I never want to see it again!" went
on the man, rising to a sitting position. "It nearly killed me twice
to-day. I'll never ride again."

"You'll feel differently after the doctor fixes you up," said Mr.
Swift with a smile.

"Doctor! I don't need a doctor," cried the stranger. "I am only
bruised and shaken up."

"You have a bad cut on your head," said Tom.

"It isn't very deep," went on the injured man, placing his fingers
on it. "Fortunately I struck the tree a glancing blow. If you will
allow me to rest in your house a little while and give me some
plaster for the cut I shall be all right again."

"Can you walk, or shall we carry you?" asked Tom's father.

"Oh, I can walk, if you'll support me a little." And the stranger
proved that he could do this by getting to his feet and taking a few
steps. Mr. Swift and his son took hold of his arms and led him to
the house. There he was placed on a lounge and given some simple
restoratives by Mrs. Baggert, who, when she found the accident was
not serious, recovered her composure.

"I must have been unconscious for a few minutes," went on the man.

"You were," explained Tom. "When I got up to you I thought you were
dead, until I saw you breathe. Then I shut off the power of your
machine and ran in for dad. I've got the motor-cycle outside. You
can't ride it for some time, I'm afraid, Mr.--er--" and Tom stopped
in some confusion, for he realized that he did not know the man's
name.

"I beg your pardon for not introducing myself before," went on the
stranger. "I'm Wakefield Damon, of Waterfield. But don't worry about
me riding that machine again. I never shall."

"Oh, perhaps--" began Mr. Swift.

"No, I never shall," went on Mr. Damon positively. "My doctor told
me to get it, as he thought riding around the country would benefit
my health. I shall tell him his prescription nearly killed me."

"And me too," added Tom with a laugh.

"How--why--are you the young man I nearly ran down this morning?"
asked Mr. Damon, suddenly sitting up and looking at the youth.

"I am," answered our hero.

"Bless my soul! So you are!" cried Mr. Damon. "I was wondering who
it could be. It's quite a coincidence. But I was in such a cloud of
dust I couldn't make out who it was."

"You had your muffler open, and that made considerable dust,"
explained Tom.

"Was that it? Bless my existence! I thought something was wrong, but
I couldn't tell what. I went over all the instructions in the book
and those the agent told me, but I couldn't think of the right one.
I tried all sorts of things to make less dust, but I couldn't. Then,
bless my eyelashes, if the machine didn't stop just after I nearly
ran into you. I tinkered over it for an hour or more before I could
get it to going again. Then I ran into the tree. My doctor told me
the machine would do my liver good, but, bless my happiness, I'd as
soon be without a liver entirely as to do what I've done to-day. I
am done with motor-cycling!"

A hopeful look came over Tom's face, but he said nothing, that is,
not just then. In a little while Mr. Damon felt so much better that
he said he would start for home. "I'm afraid you'll have to leave
your machine here," said Tom.

"You can send for it any time you want to," added Mr. Swift.

"Bless my hatband!" exclaimed Mr. Damon, who appeared to be very
fond of blessing his various organs and his articles of wearing
apparel. "Bless my hatband! I never want to see it again! If you
will be so kind as to keep it for me, I will send a junk man after
it. I will never spend anything on having it repaired. I am done
with that form of exercise--liver or no liver--doctor or no doctor."

He appeared very determined. Tom quickly made up his mind. Mr. Damon
had gone to the bathroom to get rid of some of the mud on his hands
and face.

"Father," said Tom earnestly, "may I buy that machine off him?"

"What? Buy a broken motor-cycle?"

"I can easily fix it. It is a fine make, and in good condition. I
can repair it. I've wanted a motor-cycle for some time, and here's a
chance to get a good one cheap."

"You don't need to do that," replied Mr. Swift. "You have money
enough to buy a new one if you want it. I never knew you cared for
them."

"I didn't, until lately. But I'd rather buy this one and fix it up
than get a new one. Besides, I have an idea for a new kind of
transmission, and perhaps I can work it out on this machine."

"Oh, well, if you want it for experimental purposes, I suppose it
will be as good as any. Go ahead, get it if you wish, but don't give
too much for it."

"I'll not. I fancy I can get it cheap."

Mr. Damon returned to the living-room, where he had first been
carried.

"I cannot thank you enough for what you have done for me," he said.
"I might have lain there for hours. Bless my very existence! I have
had a very narrow escape. Hereafter when I see anyone on a motor-cycle
I shall turn my head away. The memory will be too painful," and he
touched the plaster that covered a cut on his head.

"Mr. Damon," said Tom quickly, "will you sell me that motor-cycle?"

"Bless my finger rings! Sell you that mass of junk?"

"It isn't all junk," went on the young inventor. "I can easily fix
it; though, of course," he added prudently, "it will cost something.
How much would you want for it?"

"Well," replied Mr. Damon, "I paid two hundred and fifty dollars
last week. I have ridden a hundred miles on it. That is at the rate
of two dollars and a half a mile--pretty expensive riding. But if
you are in earnest I will let you have the machine for fifty
dollars, and then I fear that I will be taking advantage of you."

"I'll give you fifty dollars," said Tom quickly, and Mr. Damon
exclaimed:

"Bless my liver--that is, if I have one. Do you mean it?"

Tom nodded. "I'll fetch you the money right away," he said, starting
for his room. He got the cash from a small safe he had arranged,
which was fitted up with an ingenious burglar alarm, and was on his
way downstairs when he heard his father call out:

"Here! What do you want? Go away from that shop! No one is allowed
there!" and looking from an upper window, Tom saw his father running
toward a stranger, who was just stepping inside the shop where Mr.
Swift was constructing his turbine motor. Tom started as he saw that
the stranger was the same black-mustached man whom he had noticed in
the post-office, and, later, in the restaurant at Mansburg.




CHAPTER V.

MR. SWIFT IS ALARMED


Stuffing the money which he intended to give to Mr. Damon in his
pocket, Tom ran downstairs. As he passed through the living-room,
intending to see what the disturbance was about, and, if necessary,
aid his father, the owner of the broken motor-cycle exclaimed:

"What's the matter? What has happened? Bless my coat-tails, but is
anything wrong?"

"I don't know," answered Tom. "There is a stranger about the shop,
and my father never allows that. I'll be back in a minute."

"Take your time," advised the somewhat eccentric Mr. Damon. "I find
my legs are a bit weaker than I suspected, and I will be glad to
rest a while longer. Bless my shoelaces, but don't hurry!"

Tom went into the rear yard, where the shops, in a small cluster of
buildings, were located. He saw his father confronting the man with
the black mustache, and Mr. Swift was saying:

"What do you want? I allow no people to come in here unless I or my
son invites them. Did you wish to see me?"

"Are you Mr. Barton Swift?" asked the man.

"Yes, that is my name."

"The inventor of the Swift safety lamp, and the turbine motor?"

At the mention of the motor Mr. Swift started.

"I am the inventor of the safety lamp you mention," he said stiffly,
"but I must decline to talk about the motor. May I ask where you
obtained your information concerning it?"

"Why, I am not at liberty to tell," went on the man. "I called to
see if we could negotiate with you for the sale of it. Parties whom
I represent--"

At that moment Tom plucked his father by the sleeve.

"Dad," whispered the youth, "I saw him in Mansburg. I think he is
one of several who have been inquiring in Mr. Merton's shop about
you and your patents. I wouldn't have anything to do with him until
I found out more about him."

"Is that so?" asked Mr. Swift quickly. Then, turning to the
stranger, he said: "My son tells me--"

But Mr. Swift got no further, for at that moment the stranger caught
sight of Tom, whom he had not noticed before.

"Ha!" exclaimed the man. "I have forgotten something--an important
engagement--will be back directly--will see you again, Mr. Swift--excuse
the trouble I have put you to--I am in a great hurry," and before
father or son could stop him, had they any desire to, the man
turned and walked quickly from the yard.

Mr. Swift stood staring at him, and so did Tom. Then the inventor
asked:

"Do you know that man? What about him, Tom? Why did he leave so
hurriedly?"

"I don't know his name," replied Tom, "but I am suspicious regarding
him, and I think he left because he suddenly recognized me."
Thereupon he told his father of seeing the man in the post-office,
and hearing the talk of the same individual and two companions in
the restaurant.

"And so you think they are up to some mischief, Tom?" asked the
parent when the son had finished.

"Well, I wouldn't go quite as far as that, but I think they are
interested in your patents, and you ought to know whether you want
them to be, or not."

"I most certainly do not--especially in the turbine motor. That is
my latest invention, and, I think, will prove very valuable. But,
though I have not mentioned it before, I expect to have trouble with
it. Soon after I perfected it, with the exception of some minor
details, I received word from a syndicate of rich men that I was
infringing on a motor, the patent of which they controlled."

"This surprised me for two reasons. One was because I did not know
that any one knew I had invented the motor. I had kept the matter
secret, and I am at a loss to know how it leaked out. To prevent any
further information concerning my plans becoming public, I sent you
to Mansburg to-day. But it seems that the precaution was of little
avail. Another matter of surprise was the information that I was
infringing on the patent of some one else. I had a very careful
examination made, and I found that the syndicate of rich men was
wrong. I was not infringing. In fact, though the motor they have is
somewhat like mine, there is one big difference--theirs does not
work, while mine does. Their patents are worthless."

"Then what do you think is their object?"

"I think they want to get control of my invention of the turbine
motor, Tom. That is what has been worrying me lately. I know these
men to be unscrupulous, and, with plenty of money, they may make
trouble for me."

"But can't you fight them in the courts?"

"Yes, I could do that. It is not as if I was a poor man, but I do
not like lawsuits. I want to live quietly and invent things. I
dislike litigation. However, if they force it on me I will fight!"
exclaimed Mr. Swift determinedly.

"Do you think this man was one of the crowd of financiers?" asked
Tom.

"It would be hard to say. I did not like his actions, and the fact
that he sneaked in here, as if he was trying to get possession of
some of my models or plans, makes it suspicious."

"It certainly does," agreed Tom. "Now, if we only knew his name we
could--"

He suddenly paused in his remark and sprang forward. He picked up an
envelope that had dropped where the stranger had been standing.

"The man lost this from his pocket, dad," said Tom eagerly. "It's a
telegram. Shall we look at it?"

"I think we will be justified in protecting ourselves. Is the
envelope open?"

"Yes."

"Then read the telegram."

Tom drew out a folded yellow slip of paper. It was a short message.
He read:

"'Anson Morse, Mansburg. See Swift to-day. Make offer. If not
accepted do the best you can. Spare no effort. Don't give plans
away.'"

"Is that all?" asked Mr. Swift.

"All except the signature."

"Who is the telegram signed by?"

"By Smeak & Katch," answered Tom.

"Those rascally lawyers!" exclaimed his father. "I was beginning to
suspect this. That is the firm which represents the syndicate of
wealthy men who are trying to get my turbine motor patents away from
me. Tom, we must be on our guard! They will wage a fierce fight
against me, for they have sunk many thousands of dollars in a
worthless machine, and are desperate."

"We'll fight 'em!" cried Tom. "You and I, dad! We'll show 'em that
the firm of Swift & Son is swift by name and swift by nature!"

"Good!" exclaimed the inventor. "I'm glad you feel that way about
it, Tom. But we are going to have no easy task. Those men are rich
and unscrupulous. We shall have to be on guard constantly. Let me
have that telegram. It may come in useful. Now I must send word to
Reid & Crawford, my attorneys in Washington, to be on the lookout.
Matters are coming to a curious pass."

As Mr. Swift and his son started for the house, they met Mr. Damon
coming toward them.

"Bless my very existence!" cried the eccentric man. "I was beginning
to fear something had happened to you. I am glad that you are all
right. I heard voices, and I imagined--"

"It's all right," Mr. Swift reassured him. "There was a stranger
about my shop, and I never allow that. Do you feel well enough to
go? If not we shall be glad to have you remain with us. We have
plenty of room."

"Oh, thank you very much, but I must be going. I feel much better.
Bless my gaiters, but I never will trust myself in even an
automobile again! I will renounce gasolene from now on."

"That reminds me," spoke Tom. "I have the money for the motor-cycle,"
and he drew out the bills. "You are sure you will not regret your
bargain, Mr. Damon? The machine is new, and needs only slight
repairs. Fifty dollars is--"

"Tut, tut, young man! I feel as if I was getting the best of you.
Bless my handkerchief! I hope you have no bad luck with it."

"I'll try and be careful," promised Tom with a smile as he handed
over the money. "I am going to gear it differently and put some
improvements on it. Then I will use it instead of my bicycle."

"It would have to be very much improved before I trusted myself on
it again," declared Mr. Damon. "Well, I appreciate what you have
done for me, and if at any time I can reciprocate the favor, I will
only be too glad to do so. Bless my soul, though, I hope I don't
have to rescue you from trying to climb a tree," and with a laugh,
which showed that he had fully recovered from his mishap, he shook
hands with father and son and left.

"A very nice man, Tom," commented Mr. Swift. "Somewhat odd and out
of the ordinary, but a very fine character, for all that."

"That's what I say," added the son. "Now, dad, you'll see me
scooting around the country on a motor-cycle. I've always wanted
one, and now I have a bargain."

"Do you think you can repair it?"

"Of course, dad. I've done more difficult things than that. I'm
going to take it apart now, and see what it needs."

"Before you do that, Tom, I wish you would take a telegram to town
for me. I must wire my lawyers at once."

"Dad looks worried," thought Tom as he wheeled the broken motor-cycle
into a machine shop, where he did most of his work. "Well, I don't
blame him. But we'll get the best of those scoundrels yet!"




CHAPTER VI.

AN INTERVIEW IN THE DARK


While Mr. Swift was writing the message he wished his son to take to
the village, the young mechanic inspected the motor-cycle he had
purchased. Tom found that a few repairs would suffice to put it in
good shape, though an entire new front wheel would be needed. The
motor had not been damaged, as he ascertained by a test. Tom rode
into town on his bicycle, and as he hurried along he noticed in the
west a bank of ugly-looking clouds that indicated a shower.

"I'm in for a wetting before I get back," he mused, and he increased
his speed, reaching the telegraph office shortly before seven
o'clock.

"Think this storm will hold off until I get home?" asked Tom.

"I'm afraid not," answered the agent. "You'd better get a hustle
on."

Tom sprinted off. It was getting dark rapidly, and when he was about
a mile from home he felt several warm drops on his face.

"Here it comes!" exclaimed the youth. "Now for a little more speed!"

Tom pressed harder on the pedals, too hard, in fact, for an instant
later something snapped, and the next he knew he was flying over the
handle-bars of the bicycle. At the same time there was a metallic,
clinking sound.

"Chain's busted!" exclaimed the lad as he picked himself up out of
the dust. "Well, wouldn't that jar you!" and he walked back to
where, in the dusk, he could dimly discern his wheel.

The chain had come off the two sprockets and was lying to one side.
Tom picked it up and ascertained by close observation that the screw
and nut holding the two joining links together was lost.

"Nice pickle!" he murmured. "How am I going to find it in all this
dust and darkness?" he asked himself disgustedly. "I'll carry an
extra screw next time. No, I won't, either. I'll ride my motor-cycle
next time. Well, I may as well give a look around. I hate to walk,
if I can fix it and ride."

Tom had not spent more than two minutes looking about the dusty
road, with the aid of matches, for the screw, when the rain suddenly
began falling in a hard shower.

"Guess there's no use lingering here any longer," he remarked. "I'll
push the wheel and run for home."

He started down the road in the storm and darkness. The highway soon
became a long puddle of mud, through which he splashed, finding it
more and more difficult every minute to push the bicycle in the
thick, sticky clay.

Above the roar of the wind and the swishing of the rain he heard
another sound. It was a steady "puff-puff," and then the darkness
was cut by a glare of light.

"An automobile," said Tom aloud. "Guess I'd better get out of the
way."

He turned to one side, but the auto, instead of passing him when it
got to the place where he was, made a sudden stop.

"Want a ride?" asked the chauffeur, peering out from the side
curtains which somewhat protected him from the storm. Tom saw that
the car was a large, touring one. "Can I give you a lift?" went on
the driver.

"Well, I've got my bicycle with me," explained the young inventor.
"My chain's broken, and I've got a mile to go."

"Jump up in back," invited the man. "Leave your wheel here; I guess
it will be safe."

"Oh, I couldn't do that," said Tom. "I don't mind walking. I'm wet
through now, and I can't get much wetter. I'm much obliged, though."

"Well, I'm sorry, but I can hardly take you and the bicycle, too,"
continued the chauffeur.

"Certainly not," added a voice from the tonneau of the car. "We
can't have a muddy bicycle in here. Who is that person, Simpson?"

"It's a young man," answered the driver.

"Is he acquainted around here?" went on the voice from the rear of
the car. "Ask him if he is acquainted around here, Simpson."

Tom was wondering where he had heard that voice before. He had a
vague notion that it was familiar.

"Are you acquainted around here?" obediently asked the man at the
wheel.

"I live here," replied Tom.

"Ask him if he knows any one named Swift?" continued the voice from
the tonneau, and the driver started to repeat it.

"I heard him," interrupted Tom. "Yes, I know a Mr. Swift;" but Tom,
with a sudden resolve, and one he could hardly explain, decided
that, for the present, he would not betray his own identity.

"Ask him if Mr. Swift is an inventor." Once more the unseen person
spoke in the voice Tom was trying vainly to recall.

"Yes, he is an inventor," was the youth's answer.

"Do you know much about him? What are his habits? Does he live near
his workshops? Does he keep many servants? Does he--"

The unseen questioner suddenly parted the side curtains and peered
out at Tom, who stood in the muddy road, close to the automobile. At
that moment there came a bright flash of lightning, illuminating not
only Tom's face, but that of his questioner as well. And at the
sight Tom started, no less than did the man. For Tom had recognized
him as one of the three mysterious persons in the restaurant, and as
for the man, he had also recognized Tom.

"Ah--er--um--is--Why, it's you, isn't it?" cried the questioner, and
he thrust his head farther out from between the curtains. "My, what a
storm!" he exclaimed as the rain increased. "So you know Mr. Swift,
eh? I saw you to-day in Mansburg, I think. I have a good memory for
faces. Do you work for Mr. Swift? If you do I may be able to--"

"I'm Tom Swift, son of Mr. Barton Swift," said Tom as quietly as he
could.

"Tom Swift! His son!" cried the man, and he seemed much agitated.
"Why, I thought--that is, Morse said--Simpson, hurry back to
Mansburg!" and with that, taking no more notice of Tom, the man in
the auto hastily drew the curtains together.

The chauffeur threw in the gears and swung the ponderous machine to
one side. The road was wide, and he made the turn skilfully. A
moment later the car was speeding back the way it had come, leaving
Tom standing on the highway, alone in the mud and darkness, with the
rain pouring down in torrents.




CHAPTER VII.

OFF ON A SPIN


Tom's first impulse was to run after the automobile, the red tail-light
of which glowed through the blackness like a ruby eye. Then he
realized that it was going from him at such a swift pace that it
would be impossible to get near it, even if his bicycle was in
working order.

"But if I had my motor-cycle I'd catch up to them," he murmured. "As
it is, I must hurry home and tell dad. This is another link in the
queer chain that seems to be winding around us. I wonder who that
man was, and what he wanted by asking so many personal questions
about dad?"

Trundling his wheel before him, with the chain dangling from the
handle-bar, Tom splashed on through the mud and rain. It was a
lonesome, weary walk, tired as he was with the happenings of the
day, and the young inventor breathed a sigh of thankfulness as the
lights of his home shone out in the mist of the storm. As he tramped
up the steps of the side porch, his wheel bumping along ahead of
him, a door was thrown open.

"Why, it's Tom!" exclaimed Mrs. Baggert. "Whatever happened to you?"
and she hurried forward with kindly solicitude, for the housekeeper
was almost a second mother to the youth.

"Chain broke," answered the lad laconically. "Where's dad?"

"Out in the shop, working at his latest invention, I expect. But are
you hurt?"

"Oh, no. I fell easily. The mud was like a feather-bed, you know,
except that it isn't so good for the clothes," and the young
inventor looked down at his splashed and bedraggled garments.

Mr. Swift was very much surprised when Tom told him of the happening
on the road, and related the conversation and the subsequent alarm
of the man on learning Tom's identity.

"Who do you suppose he could have been?" asked Tom, when he had
finished.

"I am pretty certain he was one of that crowd of financiers of whom
Anson Morse seems to be a representative," said Mr. Swift. "Are you
sure the man was one of those you saw in the restaurant?"

"Positive. I had a good look at him both times. Do you think he
imagined he could come here and get possession of some of your
secrets?"

"I hardly know what to think, Tom. But we will take every
precaution. We will set the burglar alarm wires, which I have
neglected for some time, as I fancied everything would be secure
here. Then I will take my plans and the model of the turbine motor
into the house. I'll run no chances to-night."

Mr. Swift, who was adjusting some of the new bolts that Tom had
brought home that day; began to gather up his tools and material.

"I'll help you, dad," said Tom, and he began connecting the burglar
alarm wires, there being an elaborate system of them about the
house, shops and grounds.

Neither Tom nor his father slept well that night. Several times one
or the other of them arose, thinking they heard unusual noises, but
it was only some disturbance caused by the storm, and morning
arrived without anything unusual having taken place. The rain still
continued, and Tom, looking from his window and seeing the downpour,
remarked:

"I'm glad of it!"

"Why?" asked his father, who was in the next room.

"Because I'll have a good excuse for staying in and working on my
motor-cycle."

"But you must do some studying," declared Mr. Swift. "I will hear
you in mathematics right after breakfast."

"All right, dad. I guess you'll find I have my lessons."

Tom had graduated with honors from a local academy, and when it came
to a question of going further in his studies, he had elected to
continue with his father for a tutor, instead of going to college.
Mr. Swift was a very learned man, and this arrangement was
satisfactory to him, as it allowed Tom more time at home, so he
could aid his father on the inventive work and also plan things for
himself. Tom showed a taste for mechanics, and his father wisely
decided that such training as his son needed could be given at home
to better advantage than in a school or college.

Lessons over, Tom hurried to his own particular shop, and began
taking apart the damaged motor-cycle.

"First I'll straighten the handle-bars, and then I'll fix the motor
and transmission," he decided. "The front wheel I can buy in town,
as this one would hardly pay for repairing." Tom was soon busy with
wrenches, hammers, pliers and screw-driver. He was in his element,
and was whistling over his task. The motor he found in good
condition, but it was not such an easy task as he had hoped to
change the transmission. He had finally to appeal to his father, in
order to get the right proportion between the back and front gears,
for the motor-cycle was operated by a sprocket chain, instead of a
belt drive, as is the case with some.

Mr. Swift showed Tom how to figure out the number of teeth needed on
each sprocket, in order to get an increase of speed, and as there
was a sprocket wheel from a disused piece of machinery available,
Tom took that. He soon had it in place, and then tried the motor. To
his delight the number of revolutions of the rear wheel were
increased about fifteen per cent.

"I guess I'll make some speed," he announced to his father.

"But it will take more gasolene to run the motor; don't forget that.
You know the great principle of mechanics--that you can't get out of
a machine any more than you put into it, nor quite as much, as a
matter of fact, for considerable is lost through friction."

"Well, then, I'll enlarge the gasolene tank," declared Tom. "I want
to go fast when I'm going."

He reassembled the machine, and after several hours of work had it
in shape to run, except that a front wheel was lacking.

"I think I'll go to town and get one," he remarked. "The rain isn't
quite so hard now."

In spite of his father's mild objections Tom went, using his
bicycle, the chain of which he had quickly repaired. He found just
the front wheel needed, and that night his motor-cycle was ready to
run. But it was too dark to try it then, especially as he had no
good lantern, the one on the cycle having been smashed, and his own
bicycle light not being powerful enough. So he had to postpone his
trial trip until the next day.

He was up early the following morning, and went out for a spin
before breakfast. He came back, with flushed cheeks and bright eyes,
just as Mr. Swift and Mrs. Baggert were sitting down to the table.

"To Reedville and back," announced Tom proudly.

"What, a round trip of thirty miles!" exclaimed Mr. Swift.

"That's what!" declared his son. "I went like a greased pig most of
the way. I had to slow up going through Mansburg, but the rest of at
time I let it out for all it was worth."

"You must be careful," cautioned his father. "You are not an expert
yet."

"No, I realize that. Several times, when I wanted to slow up, I
began to back-pedal, forgetting that I wasn't on my bicycle. Then I
thought to shut off the power and put on the brake. But it's
glorious fun. I'm going out again as soon as I have something to
eat. That is, unless you want me to help you, dad."

"No, not this morning. Learn to ride the motor-cycle. It may come in
handy."

Neither Tom nor his father realized what an important part the
machine was soon to play in their lives.

Tom went out for another spin after breakfast, and in a different
direction. He wanted to see what the machine would do on a hill, and
there was a long, steep one about five miles from home. The roads
were in fine shape after the rain, and he speeded up the incline at
a rapid rate.

"It certainly does eat up the road," the lad murmured. "I have
improved this machine considerably. Wish I could take out a patent
on it."

Reaching the crest of the slope, he started down the incline. He
turned off part of the power, and was gliding along joyously, when
from a cross-road he suddenly saw turn into the main highway a mule,
drawing a ramshackle wagon, loaded with fence posts. Beside the
animal walked an old colored man.

"I hope he gets out of the way in time," thought Tom. "He's moving
as slow as molasses, and I'm going a bit faster than I like. Guess
I'll shut off and put on the brakes."

The mule and wagon were now squarely across the road. Tom was coming
nearer and nearer. He turned the handle-grip, controlling the supply
of gasolene, and to his horror he found that it was stuck. He could
not stop the motor-cycle!

"Look out! Look out!" cried Tom to the negro. "Get out of the way! I
can't stop! Let me pass you!"

The darky looked up. He saw the approaching machine, and he seemed
to lose possession of his senses.

"Whoa, Boomerang!" cried the negro. "Whoa! Suffin's gwine t'
happen!"

"That's what!" muttered Tom desperately, as he saw that there was
not room for him to pass without going into the ditch, a proceeding
that would mean an upset. "Pull out of the way!" he yelled again.

But either the driver could not understand, or did not appreciate
the necessity. The mule stopped and reared up. The colored man
hurried to the head of the animal to quiet it.

"Whoa, Boomerang! Jest yo' stand still!" he said.

Tom, with a great effort, managed to twist the grip and finally shut
off the gasolene. But it was too late. He struck the darky with the
front wheel. Fortunately the youth had managed to somewhat reduce
his speed by a quick application of the brake, or the result might
have been serious. As it was, the colored man was gently lifted away
from the mule's head and tossed into the long grass in the ditch.
Tom, by a great effort, succeeded in maintaining his seat in the
saddle, and then, bringing the machine to a stop, he leaped off and
turned back.

The colored man was sitting up, looking dazed.

"Whoa, Boomerang!" he murmured. "Suffin's happened!"

But the mule, who had quieted down, only waggled his ears lazily,
and Tom, ready to laugh, now that he saw he had not committed
manslaughter, hurried to where the colored man was sitting.




CHAPTER VIII.

SUSPICIOUS ACTIONS


"Are you hurt?" asked Tom as he leaned his motor-cycle against the
fence and stood beside the negro.

"Hurt?" repeated the darky. "I'se killed, dat's what I is! I ain't
got a whole bone in mah body! Good landy, but I suttinly am in a
awful state! Would yo' mind tellin' me if dat ar' mule am still
alive?"

"Of course he is," answered Tom. "He isn't hurt a bit. But why can't
you turn around and look for yourself?"

"No, sah! No, indeedy, sah!" replied the colored man. "Yo' doan't
catch dis yeah nigger lookin' around!"

"Why not?"

"Why not? 'Cause I'll tell yo' why not. I'm so stiff an' I'm so
nearly broke t' pieces, dat if I turn mah head around it suah will
twist offen mah body. No, sah! No, indeedy, sah, I ain't gwine t'
turn 'round. But am yo' suah dat mah mule Boomerang ain't hurted?"

"No, he's not hurt a bit, and I'm sure you are not. I didn't strike
you hard, for I had almost stopped my machine. Try to get up. I'm
positive you'll find yourself all right. I'm sorry it happened."

"Oh, dat's all right. Doan't mind me," went on the colored man. "It
was mah fault fer gittin in de road. But dat mule Boomerang am
suttinly de most outrageous quadruped dat ever circumlocuted."

"Why do you call him Boomerang?" asked Tom, wondering if the negro
really was hurt.

"What fo' I call him Boomerang? Did yo' eber see dem Australian
black mans what go around wid a circus t'row dem crooked sticks dey
calls boomerangs?"

"Yes, I've seen them."

"Well, Boomerang, mah mule, am jest laik dat. He's crooked, t' begin
wid, an' anudder t'ing, yo' can't never tell when yo' start him whar
he's gwine t' land up. Dat's why I calls him Boomerang."

"I see. It's a very proper name. But why don't you try to get up?"

"Does yo' t'ink I can?"

"Sure. Try it. By the way, what's your name?"

"My name? Why I was christened Eradicate Andrew Jackson Abraham
Lincoln Sampson, but folks most ginnerally calls me Eradicate
Sampson, an' some doan't eben go to dat length. Dey jest calls me
Rad, fo' short."

"Eradicate," mused Tom. "That's a queer name, too. Why were you
called that?"

"Well, yo' see I eradicates de dirt. I'm a cleaner an' a whitewasher
by profession, an' somebody gib me dat name. Dey said it were fitten
an' proper, an' I kept it eber sence. Yais, sah, I'se Eradicate
Sampson, at yo' service. Yo' ain't got no chicken coops yo' wants
cleaned out, has yo'? Or any stables or fences t' whitewash? I
guarantees satisfaction."

"Well, I might find some work for you to do," replied the young
inventor, thinking this would be as good a means as any of placating
the darky. "But come, now, try and see if you can't stand. I don't
believe I broke any of your legs."

"I guess not. I feels better now. Where am dat work yo' was speakin'
ob?" and Eradicate Sampson, now that there seemed to be a prospect
of earning money, rose quickly and easily.

"Why, you're all right!" exclaimed Tom, glad to find that the
accident had had no serious consequences.

"Yais, sah, I guess I be. Whar did yo' say, yo' had some
whitewashin' t' do?"

"No place in particular, but there is always something that needs
doing at our house. If you call I'll give you a job."

"Yais, sah, I'll be sure to call," and Eradicate walked back to
where Boomerang was patiently waiting.

Tom told the colored man how to find the Swift home, and was
debating with himself whether he ought not to offer Eradicate some
money as compensation for knocking him into the air, when he noticed
that the negro was tying one wheel of his wagon fast to the body of
the vehicle with a rope.

"What are you doing that for?" asked Tom.

"Got to, t' git downhill wid dis load ob fence posts," was the
answer. "Ef I didn't it would be right on to de heels ob Boomerang,
an' wheneber he feels anyt'ing on his heels he does act wuss dan a
circus mule."

"But why don't you use your brake? I see you have one on the wagon.
Use the brake to hold back going downhill."

"'Scuse me, Mistah Swift, 'scuse me!" exclaimed Eradicate quickly.
"But yo' doan't know dat brake. It's wuss dan none at all. It doan't
work, fer a fact. No, indeedy, sah. I'se got to rope de wheel."

Tom was interested at once. He made an examination of the brake, and
soon saw why it would not hold the wheels. The foot lever was not
properly connected with the brake bar. It was a simple matter to
adjust it by changing a single bolt, and this Tom did with tools he
took from the bag on his motor-cycle. The colored man looked on in
open-mouthed amazement, and even Boomerang peered lazily around, as
if taking an interest in the proceedings.

"There," said Tom at length, as he tightened the nut. "That brake
will work now, and hold the wagon on any hill. You won't need to
rope the wheel. You didn't have the right leverage on it."

"'Scuse me, Mistah Swift, but what's dat yo' said?" and Eradicate
leaned forward to listen deferentially.

"I said you didn't have the right leverage."

"No, sah, Mistah Swift, 'scuse me, but yo' made a slight mistake. I
ain't never had no liverage on dis yeah wagon. It ain't dat kind ob
a wagon. I onct drove a livery rig, but dat were some years ago. I
ain't worked fo' de livery stable in some time now. Dat's why I know
dere ain't no livery on dis wagon. Yo'll 'scuse me, but yo' am
slightly mistaken."

"All right," rejoined Tom with a laugh, not thinking it worth while
to explain what he meant by the lever force of the brake rod. "Let
it go at that. Livery or no livery, your brake will work now. I
guess you're all right. Now don't forget to come around and do some
whitewashing," and seeing that the colored man was able to mount to
the seat and start off Boomerang, who seemed to have deep-rooted
objections about moving, Tom wheeled his motor-cycle back to the
road.

Eradicate Sampson drove his wagon a short distance and then suddenly
applied the brake. It stopped short, and the mule looked around as
if surprised.

"It suah do work, Mistah Swift!" called the darky to Tom, who was
waiting the result of his little repair job. "It suah do work!"

"I'm glad of it."

"Mah golly! But yo' am suttinly a conjure-man when it comes t'
fixin' wagons! Did yo' eber work fer a blacksmith?"

"No, not exactly. Well, good-by, Eradicate. I'll look for you some
day next week."

With that Tom leaped on his machine and speeded off ahead of the
colored man and his rig. As he passed the load of fence posts the
youth heard Eradicate remark in awestricken tones:

"Mah golly! He suttinly go laik de wind! An' t' t'ink dat I were hit
by dat monstrousness machine, an' not hurted! Mah golly! T'ings am
suttinly happenin'! G'lang, Boomerang!"

"This machine has more possibilities in it than I suspected," mused
Tom. "But one thing I've got to change, and that is the gasolene and
spark controls. I don't like them the way they are. I want a better
leverage, just as Eradicate needed on his wagon. I'll fix them, too,
when I get home."

He rode for several hours, until he thought it was about dinner
time, and then, heading the machine toward home, he put on all the
speed possible, soon arriving where his father was at work in the
shop.

"Well, how goes it?" asked Mr. Swift with a smile as he looked at
the flushed face of his son.

"Fine, dad! I scooted along in great shape. Had an adventure, too."

"You didn't meet any more of those men, did you? The men who are
trying to get my invention?" asked Mr. Swift apprehensively.

"No, indeed, dad. I simply had a little run-in with a chap named
Eradicate Andrew Jackson Abraham Lincoln Sampson, otherwise known as
Rad Sampson, and I engaged him to do some whitewashing for us. We do
need some white washing done, don't we, dad?"

"What's that?" asked Mr. Swift, thinking his son was joking.

Then Tom told of the happening.

"Yes, I think I can find some work for Eradicate to do," went on Mr.
Swift. "There is some dirt in the boiler shop that needs
eradicating, and I think he can do it. But dinner has been waiting
some time. We'll go in now, or Mrs. Baggert will be out after us."

Father and son were soon at the table, and Tom was explaining what
he meant to do to improve his motor-cycle. His father offered some
suggestions regarding the placing of the gasolene lever.

"I'd put it here," he said, and with his pencil he began to draw a
diagram on the white table cloth.

"Oh, my goodness me, Mr. Swift!" exclaimed Mrs. Baggert. "Whatever
are you doing?" and she sprang up in some alarm.

"What's the matter? Did I upset my tea?" asked the inventor
innocently.

"No; but you are soiling a clean tablecloth. Pencil-marks are so
hard to get out. Take a piece of paper, please."

"Oh, is that all?" rejoined Mr. Swift with a smile. "Well, Tom, here
is the way I would do that," and substituting the back of an
envelope for the tablecloth, he continued the drawing.

Tom was looking over his father's shoulder interestedly, when Mrs.
Baggert, who was taking off some of the dinner dishes, suddenly
asked:

"Are you expecting a visitor, Mr. Swift?"

"A visitor? No. Why?" asked the inventor quickly.

"Because I just saw a man going in the machine shop," went on the
housekeeper.

"A man! In the machine shop!" exclaimed Tom, rising from his chair.
Mr. Swift also got up, and the two hurried from the house. As they
reached the yard they saw a man emerging from the building where Mr.
Swift was constructing his turbine motor. The man had his back
turned toward them and seemed to be sneaking around, as though
desirous of escaping observation.

"What do you want?" called Mr. Swift.

The man turned quickly. At the sight of Mr. Swift and Tom he made a
jump to one side and got behind a big packing-box.

"That's queer," spoke Tom. "I wonder what he wants?"

"I'll soon see," rejoined Mr. Swift, and he started on a run toward
where the man was hiding. Tom followed his father, and as the two
inventors reached the box the man sprang from behind it and down the
yard to a lane that passed in back of the Swift house. As he ran he
was seen to stuff some papers in his pocket.

"My plans! He's stolen some of my plans!" cried Mr. Swift. "Catch
him, Tom!"

Tom ran after the stranger, whose curious actions had roused their
suspicions, while Mr. Swift entered the motor shop to ascertain
whether anything had been stolen.




CHAPTER IX.

A FRUITLESS PURSUIT


Down through the yard Tom speeded, in and out among the buildings,
looking on every side for a sight of the bold stranger. No one was
to be seen.

"He can't be very far ahead," thought Tom. "I ought to catch him
before he gets to the woods. If he reaches there he has a good
chance of getting away."

There was a little patch of trees just back of the inventor's house,
not much of a woods, perhaps, but that is what they were called.

"I wonder if he was some ordinary tramp, looking for what he could
steal, or if he was one of the gang after dad's invention?" thought
Tom as he sprinted ahead.

By this time the youth was clear of the group of buildings and in
sight of a tall, board fence, which surrounded the Swift estate on
three sides. Here and there, along the barrier, were piled old
packing-cases, so that it would be easy for a fugitive to leap upon
one of them and so get over the fence. Tom thought of this
possibility in a moment.

"I guess he got over ahead of me," the lad exclaimed, and he peered
sharply about. "I'll catch him on the other side!"

At that instant Tom tripped over a plank and went down full length,
making quite a racket. When he picked himself up he was surprised to
see the man he was after dart from inside a big box and start for
the fence, near a point where there were some packing-cases piled
up, making a good approach to the barrier. The fugitive had been
hiding, waiting for a chance to escape, and Tom's fall had alarmed
him.

"Here! Hold on there! Come back!" cried the youth as he recovered
his wind and leaped forward.

But the man did not stay. With a bound he was up on the pile of
boxes, and the next moment he was poised on top of the fence. Before
leaping down on the other side, a jump at which even a practiced
athlete might well hesitate, the fleeing stranger paused and looked
back. Tom gazed at him and recognized the man in an instant. He was
the third of the mysterious trio whom the lad had seen in the
Mansburg restaurant.

"Wait a minute! What do you want sneaking around here?" shouted Tom
as he ran forward. The man returned no answer, and an instant later
disappeared from view on the other side of the fence.

"He jumped down!" thought Tom. "A big leap, too. Well, I've got to
follow. This is a queer proceeding. First one, then the second, and
now the third of those men seem determined to get something here. I
wonder if this one succeeded? I'll soon find out."

The lad was up on the pile of packing-cases and over the fence in
almost record time. He caught a glimpse of the fugitive running
toward the woods. Then the boy leaped down, jarring himself
considerably, and took after the man.

But though Tom was a good runner he was handicapped by the fact that
the man had a start of him, and also by the fact that the stranger
had had a chance to rest while hiding for the second time in the big
box, while Tom had kept on running. So it is no great cause for
wonder that Mr. Swift's son found himself being distanced.

Once, twice he called on the fleeing one to halt, but the man paid
no attention, and did not even turn around. Then the youth wisely
concluded to save his wind for running. He did his best, but was
chagrined to see the man reach the woods ahead of him.

"I've lost him now," thought Tom. "Well, there's no help for it."

Still he did not give up, but kept on through the patch of trees. On
the farther side was Lake Carlopa, a broad and long sheet of water.

"If he doesn't know the lake's there," thought our hero, "he may
keep straight on. The water will be sure to stop him, and I can
catch him. But what will I do with him after I get him? That's
another question. I guess I've got a right to demand to know what he
was doing around our place, though."

But Tom need not have worried on this score. He could hear the
fugitive ahead of him, and marked his progress by the crackling of
the underbrush.

"I'm almost up to him," exulted the young inventor. Then, at the
same moment, he caught sight of the man running, and a glimpse of
the sparkling water of Lake Carlopa. "I've got him! I've got him!"
Tom almost cried aloud in his excitement. "Unless he takes to the
water and swims for it, I've got him!"

But Tom did not reckon on a very simple matter, and that was the
possibility of the man having a boat at hand. For this is just what
happened. Reaching the lake shore the fugitive with a final spurt
managed to put considerable distance between himself and Tom. Drawn
up on the beach was a little motor-boat. In this, after he had
pushed it from shore, the stranger leaped. It was the work of but a
second to set the engine in motion, and as Tom reached the edge of
the woods and started across the narrow strip of sand and gravel
that was between the water and the trees, he saw the man steering
his craft toward the middle of the lake.

"Well--I'll--be--jiggered!" exclaimed the youth. "Who would have
thought he'd have a motor-boat waiting for him? He planned this
well."

There was nothing to do but turn back. Tom had a small rowboat and a
sailing skiff on the lake, but his boathouse was some distance away,
and even if he could get one of his craft out, the motor-boat would
soon distance it.

"He's gone!" thought the searcher regretfully.

The man in the motor-boat did not look back. He sat in the bow,
steering the little craft right across the broadest part of Lake
Carlopa.

"I wonder where he came from, and where he's going?" mused Tom.
"That's a boat I never saw on this lake before. It must be a new
one. Well, there's no help for it, I've got to go back and tell dad
I couldn't catch him." And with a last look at the fugitive, who,
with his boat, was becoming smaller and smaller every minute, Tom
turned and retraced his steps.




CHAPTER X.

OFF TO ALBANY


"Did you catch him, Tom?" asked Mr. Swift eagerly when his son
returned, but the inventor needed but a glance at the lad's
despondent face to have his question answered without words, "Never
mind," he added, "there's not much harm done, fortunately."

"Did he get anything? Any of your plans or models, dad?"

"No; not as far as I can discover. My papers in the shop were not
disturbed, but it looked as if the turbine model had been moved. The
only thing missing seems to be a sheet of unimportant calculations.
Luckily I had my most valuable drawings in the safe in the house."

"Yet that man seemed to be putting papers in his pocket, dad. Maybe
he made copies of some of your drawings."

"That's possible, Tom, and I admit it worries me. I can't imagine
who that man is, unless--"

"Why, he's one of the three men I saw in Mansburg in the
restaurant," said Tom eagerly. "Two of them tried to get information
here, and now the third one comes. He got away in a motor-boat," and
Tom told how the fugitive escaped.

Mr. Swift looked worried. It was not the first time attempts had
been made to steal his inventions, but on this occasion a desperate
and well-organized plan appeared to be on foot.

"What do you think they are up to, dad?" asked Tom.

"I think they are trying to get hold of my turbine motor, Tom. You
know I told you that the financiers were disappointed in the turbine
motor they bought of another inventor. It does not work. To get back
the money they spent in building an expensive plant they must have a
motor that is successful. Hence their efforts to get control of
mine. I don't know whether I told you or not, but some time ago I
refused a very good offer for certain rights in my invention. I knew
it was worth more. The offer came through Smeak & Katch, the
lawyers, and when I refused it they seemed much disappointed. I
think now that this same firm, and the financiers who have employed
them, are trying by all the means in their power to get possession
of my ideas, if not the invention and model itself."

"What can you do, dad?"

"Well, I must think. I certainly must take some means to protect
myself. I have had trouble before, but never any like this. I did
not think those men would be so unscrupulous."

"Do you know their names?"

"No, only from that telegram we found; the one which the first
stranger dropped. One of them must be Anson Morse. Who the others
are I don't know. But now I must make some plans to foil these
sharpers. I may have to call on you for help, Tom."

"And I'll be ready any time you call on me, dad," responded Tom,
drawing himself up. "Can I do anything for you right away?"

"No; I must think out a plan."

"Then I am going to change my motor-cycle a bit. I'll put some more
improvements on it."

"And I will write some letters to my lawyers in Washington and ask
their advice." It took Tom the remainder of that day, and part of
the next, to arrange the gasolene and spark control of his machine
to his satisfaction. He had to make two small levers and some
connecting rods. This he did in his own particular machine shop,
which was fitted up with a lathe and other apparatus. The lathe was
run by power coming from a small engine, which was operated by an
engineer, an elderly man to whom Mr. Swift had given employment for
many years. He was Garret Jackson, and he kept so close to his
engine and boiler-room that he was seldom seen outside of it except
when the day's work was done.

One afternoon, a few days after the unsuccessful chase after the
fugitive had taken place, Tom went out for a spin on his
motor-cycle. He found that the machine worked much better, and was
easier to control. He rode about fifteen miles away from home, and
then returned. As he entered the yard he saw, standing on the drive, a
ramshackle old wagon, drawn by a big mule, which seemed, at the time
Tom observed him, to be asleep.

"I'll wager that's Boomerang," said Tom aloud, and the mule opened
its eyes, wiggled its ears and started forward.

"Whoa dar, Boomerang!" exclaimed a voice, and Eradicate Sampson
hurried around the corner of the house. "Dat's jest lake yo'," went
on the colored man. "Movin' when yo' ain't wanted to." Then, as he
caught sight of Tom, he exclaimed, "Why, if it ain't young Mistah
Swift! Good lordy! But dat livery brake yo' done fixed on mah wagon
suttinly am fine. Ah kin go down de steepest hill widout ropin' de
wheel."

"Glad of it," replied Tom. "Did you come to do some work?"

"Yais, sah, I done did. I found I had some time t' spah, an' thinks
I dere might be some whitewashin' I could do. Yo' see, I lib only
'bout two mile from heah."

"Well, I guess you can do a few jobs," said Tom. "Wait here."

He hunted up his father, and obtained permission to set Eradicate at
work cleaning out a chicken house and whitewashing it. The darky was
soon at work. A little later Tom passing saw him putting the
whitewash on thick. Eradicate stopped at the sight of Tom, and made
some curious motions.

"What's the matter, Rad?" asked the young inventor.

"Why, de whitewash done persist in runnin' down de bresh handle an'
inter mah sleeve. I'm soakin' wet from it now, an' I has t' stop
ebery onct in a while 'case mah sleeve gits full."

Tom saw what the trouble was. The white fluid did run down the long
brush handle in a small rivulet. Tom had once seen a little rubber
device on a window-cleaning brush that worked well, and he decided
to try it for Eradicate.

"Wait a minute," Tom advised. "I think I can stop that for you."

The colored man was very willing to take a rest, but it did not last
long, for Tom was soon back at the chicken coop. He had a small
rubber disk, with a hole in the center, the size of the brush
handle. Slipping the disk over the wood, he pushed it about half way
along, and then, handing the brush back to the negro, told him to
try it that way.

"Did yo' done put a charm on mah bresh?" asked Eradicate somewhat
doubtfully.

"Yes, a sort of hoodoo charm. Try it now."

The darky dipped his brush in the pail of whitewash, and then began
to spread the disinfectant on the sides of the coop near the top.
The surplus fluid started to run down the handle, but, meeting the
piece of rubber, came no farther, and dripped off on the ground. It
did not run down the sleeve of Eradicate.

"Well, I 'clar t' goodness! That suttinly am a mighty fine charm!"
cried the colored man. "Yo' suah am a pert gen'men, all right. Now I
kin work widout stoppin' t' empty mah sleeve ob lime juice ebery
minute. I'se suttinly obliged t' yo'."

"You're welcome, I'm sure," replied Tom. "I think some day I'll
invent a machine for whitewashing, and then--"

"Doan't do dat! Doan't do dat!" begged Eradicate earnestly. "Dis,
an' makin' dirt disappear, am de only perfessions I got. Doan't go
'ventin' no machine, Mistah Swift."

"All right. I'll wait until you get rich."

"Ha, ha! Den yo' gwine t' wait a pow'ful long time," chuckled
Eradicate as he went on with his whitewashing.

Tom went into the house. He found his father busy with some papers
at his desk.

"Ah, it's you, is it, Tom?" asked the inventor, looking up. "I was
just wishing you would come in."

"What for, dad?"

"Well, I have quite an important mission for you. I want you to go
on a journey."

"A journey? Where?"

"To Albany. You see, I've been thinking over matters, and I have
been in correspondence with my lawyers in regard to my turbine
motor. I must take measures to protect myself. You know I have not
yet taken out a complete patent on the machine. I have not done so
because I did not want to put my model on exhibition in Washington.
I was afraid some of those unscrupulous men would take advantage of
me. Another point was that I had not perfected a certain device that
goes on the motor. That objection is now removed, and I am ready to
send my model to Washington, and take out the complete patent."

"But I thought you said you wanted me to go to Albany."

"So I do. I will explain. I have just had a letter from Reid &
Crawford, my Washington attorneys. Mr. Crawford, the junior member
of the firm, will be in Albany this week on some law business. He
agrees to receive my model and some papers there, and take them back
to Washington with him. In this way they will be well protected. You
see, I have to be on my guard, and if I send the model to Albany,
instead of the national capital, I may throw the plotters off the
track, for I feel that they are watching every move I make. As soon
as you or I should start for Washington they would be on our trail.
But you can go to Albany unsuspected. Mr. Crawford will wait for you
there. I want you to start day after to-morrow."

"All right, dad. I can start now, if you say so."

"No, there is no special need for haste. I have some matters to
arrange. You might go to the station and inquire about trains to the
State capital."

"Am I going by train?"

"Certainly. How else could you go?"

There was a look of excitement in Tom's eyes. He had a sudden idea.

"Dad," he exclaimed, "why couldn't I go on my motor-cycle?"

"Your motor-cycle?"

"Yes. I could easily make the trip on it in one day. The roads are
good, and I would enjoy it. I can carry the model back of me on the
saddle. It is not very large."

"Well," said Mr. Swift slowly, for the idea was a new one to him, "I
suppose that part would be all right. But you have not had much
experience riding a motor-cycle. Besides, you don't know the roads."

"I can inquire. Will you let me go, dad?"

Mr. Swift appeared to hesitate.

"It will be fine!" went on Tom. "I would enjoy the trip, and there's
another thing. If we want to keep this matter secret the best plan
would be to let me go on my machine. If those men are on the watch,
they will not think that I have the model. They will think I'm just
going for a pleasure jaunt."

"There's something in that," admitted Mr. Swift, and Tom, seeing
that his father was favorably inclined, renewed his arguments, until
the inventor finally agreed.

"It will be a great trip!" exclaimed Tom. "I'll go all over my machine
now, to see that it's in good shape. You get your papers and model
ready, dad, and I'll take them to Albany for you. The motor-cycle will
come in handy."

But had Tom only known the dangers ahead of him, and the risks he
was to run, he would not have whistled so light heartedly as he went
over every nut and bolt on his machine.

Two days later, the valuable model, having been made into a
convenient package, and wrapped in water-proof paper, was fastened
back of the saddle on the motor-cycle. Tom carefully pinned in an
inside pocket the papers which were to be handed to Mr. Crawford. He
was to meet the lawyer at a hotel in Albany.

"Now take care of yourself, Tom," cautioned his father as he bade
him good-by. "Don't try to make speed, as there is no special rush.
And, above all, don't lose anything."

"I'll not, dad," and with a wave of his hand to Mr. Swift and the
housekeeper, who stood in the door to see him off, Tom jumped into
the saddle, started the machine, and then, after sufficient momentum
had been attained, he turned on the gasolene and set the spark
lever. With rattles and bangs, which were quickly subdued by the
muffler, the machine gathered speed. Tom was off for Albany.




CHAPTER XI.

A VINDICTIVE TRAMP


Though Tom's father had told him there was no necessity for any
great speed, the young inventor could not resist the opportunity for
pushing his machine to the limit. The road was a level one and in
good condition, so the motor-cycle fairly flew along. The day was
pleasant, a warm sun shining overhead, and it was evident that early
summer was crowding spring rather closely.

"This is glorious!" exclaimed Tom aloud as he spun along. "I'm glad I
persuaded dad to let me take this trip. It was a great idea. Wish Ned
Newton was along, though. He'd be company for me, but, as Ned would
say, there are two good reasons why he can't come. One is he has to
work in the bank, and the other is that he has no motor-cycle."

Tom swept past house after house along the road, heading in the
opposite direction from that in which lay the town of Shopton and
the city of Mansburg. For several miles Tom's route would lie
through a country district. The first large town he would reach
would be Centreford. He planned to get lunch there, and he had
brought a few sandwiches with him to eat along the road in case he
became hungry before he reached the place.

"I hope the package containing the model doesn't jar off," mused the
lad as he reached behind to make sure that the precious bundle was
safe. "Dad would be in a bad way if that should disappear. And the
papers, too." He put his hand to his inner pocket to feel that they
were secure. Coming to a little down-grade, Tom shut off some of the
power, the new levers he had arranged to control the gasolene and
spark working well.

"I think I'll take the old wood road and pass through Pompville,"
Tom decided, after covering another mile or two. He was approaching
a division in the highway. "It's a bit sandy," he went on, "and the
going will be heavy, but it will be a good chance to test my
machine. Besides, I'll save five miles, and, while I don't have to
hurry, I may need time on the other end. I'd rather arrive in Albany
a little before dusk than after dark. I can deliver the model and
papers and have a good night's sleep before starting back. So the
old wood road it will be."

The wood road, as Tom called it, was a seldom used highway, which,
originally, was laid out for just what the name indicated, to bring
wood from the forest. With the disappearance of most of the trees
the road became more used for ordinary traffic between the towns of
Pompville and Edgefield. But when the State built a new highway
connecting these two places the old road fell into disuse, though it
was several miles shorter than the new turnpike.

He turned from the main thoroughfare, and was soon spinning along
the sandy stretch, which was shaded with trees that in some places
met overhead, forming a leafy arch. It was cool and pleasant, and
Tom liked it.

"It isn't as bad as I thought," he remarked. "The sand is pretty
thick, but this machine of mine appears to be able to crawl through
it."

Indeed, the motor-cycle was doing remarkably well, but Tom found
that he had to turn on full power, for the big rubber wheels went
deep into the soft soil. Along Tom rode, picking out the firmest
places in the road. He was so intent on this that he did not pay
much attention to what was immediately ahead of him, knowing that he
was not very likely to meet other vehicles or pedestrians. He was
considerably startled therefore when, as he went around a turn in
the highway where the bushes grew thick, right down to the edge of
the road, to see a figure emerge from the underbrush and start
across the path. So quickly did the man appear that Tom was almost
upon him in an instant, and even though the young inventor shut off
the power and applied the brake, the front wheel hit the man and
knocked him down.

"What's the matter with you? What are you trying to do--kill me? Why
don't you ring a bell or blow a horn when you're coming?" The man had
sprung up from the soft sand where the wheel from the motor-cycle had
sent him and faced Tom angrily. Then the rider, who had quickly
dismounted, saw that his victim was a ragged tramp.

"I'm sorry," began Tom. "You came out of the bushes so quickly that
I didn't have a chance to warn you. Did I hurt you much?"

"Well, youse might have. 'Tain't your fault dat youse didn't," and
the tramp began to brush the dirt from his ragged coat. Tom was
instantly struck by a curious fact. The tramp in his second remarks
used language more in keeping with his character, whereas, in his
first surprise and anger, he had talked much as any other person
would. "Youse fellers ain't got no right t' ride dem machines like
lightnin' along de roads," the ragged chap went on, and he still
clung to the use of words and expressions current among his
fraternity. Tom wondered at it, and then, ascribing the use of the
better language to the fright caused by being hit by the machine,
the lad thought no more about it at the time. There was occasion,
however, when he attached more meaning to it.

"I'm very sorry," went on Tom. "I'm sure I didn't mean to. You see,
I was going quite slowly, and--"

"You call dat slow, when youse hit me an' knocked me down?" demanded
the tramp. "I'd oughter have youse arrested, dat's what, an' I would
if dere was a cop handy."

"I wasn't going at all fast," said Tom, a little nettled that his
conciliatory words should be so rudely received. "If I had been
going full speed I'd have knocked you fifty feet."

"It's a good thing. Cracky, den I'm glad dat youse wasn't goin' like
dat," and the tramp seemed somewhat confused. This time Tom looked
at him more closely, for the change in his language had been very
plain. The fellow seemed uneasy, and turned his face away. As he did
so Tom caught a glimpse of what he was sure was a false beard. It
was altogether too well-kept a beard to be a natural one for such a
dirty tramp as this one appeared to be.

"That fellow's disguised!" Tom thought. "He's playing a part. I
wonder if I'd better take chances and spring it on him that I'm on
to his game?"

Then the ragged man spoke again:

"I s'pose it was part my fault, cully. I didn't know dat any guy was
comin' along on one of dem buzz-machines, or I'd been more careful.
I don't s'pose youse meant to upset me?" and he looked at Tom more
boldly. This time his words seemed so natural, and his beard, now
that Tom took a second look at it, so much a part of himself, that
the young inventor wondered if he could have been mistaken in his
first surmise.

"Perhaps he was once a gentleman, and has turned tramp because of
hard luck," thought Tom. "That would account for him using good
language at times. Guess I'd better keep still." Then to the tramp
he said: "I'm sure I didn't mean to hit you. I admit I wasn't
looking where I was going, but I never expected to meet any one on
this road. I certainly didn't expect to see a--"

He paused in some confusion. He was about to use the term "tramp,"
and he hesitated, not knowing how it would be received by his
victim.

"Oh, dat's all right, cully. Call me a tramp--I know dat's what
youse was goin' t' say. I'm used t' it. I've been a hobo so many
years now dat I don't mind. De time was when I was a decent chap,
though. But I'm a tramp now. Say, youse couldn't lend me a quarter,
could youse?"

He approached closer to Tom, and looked quickly up and down the
road. The highway was deserted, nor was there any likelihood that
any one would come along. Tom was somewhat apprehensive, for the
tramp was a burly specimen. The young inventor, however, was not so
much alarmed at the prospect of a personal encounter, as that he
feared he might be robbed, not only of his money, but the valuable
papers and model he carried. Even if the tramp was content with
taking his money, it would mean that Tom would have to go back home
for more, and so postpone his trip.

So it was with no little alarm that he watched the ragged man coming
nearer to him. Then a bright idea came into Tom's head. He quickly
shifted his position so that he brought the heavy motor-cycle
between the man and himself. He resolved, if the tramp showed a
disposition to attack him, to push the machine over on him, and this
would give Tom a chance to attack the thief to better advantage.
However, the "hobo" showed no evidence of wanting to resort to
highwayman methods. He paused a short distance from the machine, and
said admiringly:

"Dat's a pretty shebang youse has."

"Yes, it's very fair," admitted Tom, who was not yet breathing
easily.

"Kin youse go far on it?"

"Two hundred miles a day, easily."

"Fer cats' sake! An' I can't make dat ridin' on de blind baggage;
but dat's 'cause I gits put off so much. But say, is youse goin' to
let me have dat quarter? I need it, honest I do. I ain't had nuttin'
t' eat in two days."

The man's tone was whining. Surely he seemed like a genuine tramp,
and Tom felt a little sorry for him. Besides, he felt that he owed
him something for the unceremonious manner in which he had knocked
the fellow down. Tom reached his hand in his pocket for some change,
taking care to keep the machine between himself and the tramp.

"Are youse goin' far on dat rig-a-ma-jig?" went on the man as he
looked carefully over the motor-cycle.

"To Albany," answered Tom, and the moment the words were out of his
mouth he wished he could recall them. All his suspicions regarding
the tramp came back to him. But the ragged chap appeared to attach
no significance to them.

"Albany? Dat's in Jersey, ain't it?" he asked.

"No, it's in New York," replied Tom, and then, to change the
subject, he pulled out a half-dollar and handed it to the man. As he
did so Tom noticed that the tramp had tattooed on the little finger
of his left hand a blue ring.

"Dat's de stuff! Youse is a reg'lar millionaire, youse is!"
exclaimed the tramp, and his manner seemed in earnest. "I'll
remember youse, I will. What's your name, anyhow, cully?"

"Tom Swift," replied our hero, and again he wished he had not told.
This time he was sure the tramp started and glanced at him quickly,
but perhaps it was only his imagination.

"Tom Swift," repeated the man musingly, and his tones were different
from the whining ones in which he had asked for money. Then, as if
recollecting the part he was playing, he added: "I s'pose dey calls
youse dat because youse rides so quick on dat machine. But I'm
certainly obliged to youse--Tom Swift, an' I hopes youse gits t'
Albany, in Jersey, in good time."

He turned away, and Tom was beginning to breathe more easily when
the ragged man, with a quick gesture, reached out and grabbed hold
of the motor-cycle. He gave it such a pull that it was nearly torn
from Tom's grasp. The lad was so startled at the sudden exhibition
of vindictiveness an the part of the tramp that he did not know what
to do. Then, before he could recover himself, the tramp darted into
the bushes.

"I guess Happy Harry--dat's me--has spoiled your ride t' Albany!"
the tramp cried. "Maybe next time youse won't run down poor fellers
on de road," and with that, the ragged man, shaking his fist at Tom,
was lost to sight in the underbrush.

"Well, if that isn't a queer end up," mused Tom. "He must be crazy.
I hope I don't meet you again, Happy Harry, or whatever your name
is. Guess I'll get out of this neighborhood."




CHAPTER XII.

THE MEN IN THE AUTO


Tom first made sure that the package containing the model was still
safely in place back of his saddle on the motor-cycle. Finding it
there he next put his hand in his pocket to see that he had the
papers.

"They're all right," spoke Tom aloud. "I didn't know but what that
chap might have worked a pickpocket game on me. I'm glad I didn't
meet him after dark. Well, it's a good thing it's no worse. I wonder
if he tried to get my machine away from me? Don't believe he'd know
how to ride it if he did."

Tom wheeled his motor-cycle to a hard side-path along the old road,
and jumped into the saddle. He worked the pedals preparatory to
turning on the gasolene and spark to set the motor in motion. As he
threw forward the levers, having acquired what he thought was the
necessary momentum, he was surprised that no explosion followed. The
motor seemed "dead."

"That's queer," he thought, and he began to pedal more rapidly. "It
always used to start easily. Maybe it doesn't like this sandy
road."

It was hard work sending the heavy machine along by "leg power," and
once more, when he had acquired what he thought was sufficient
speed, Tom turned on the power. But no explosions followed, and in
some alarm he jumped to the ground.

"Something's wrong," he said aloud. "That tramp must have damaged
the machine when he yanked it so." Tom went quickly over the
different parts. It did not take him long to discover what the
trouble was. One of the wires, leading from the batteries to the
motor, which wire served to carry the current of electricity that
exploded the mixture of air and gasolene, was missing. It had been
broken off close to the battery box and the spark plug.

"That's what Happy Harry did!" exclaimed Tom. "He pulled that wire
off when he yanked my machine. That's what he meant by hoping I'd
get to Albany. That fellow was no tramp. He was disguised, and up to
some game. And he knows something about motor-cycles, too, or he
never would have taken that wire. I'm stalled, now, for I haven't
got another piece. I ought to have brought some. I'll have to push
this machine until I get to town, or else go back home."

The young inventor looked up and down the lonely road, undecided
what to do. To return home meant that he would be delayed in getting
to Albany, for he would lose a day. If he pushed on to Pompville he
might be able to get a bit of wire there.

Tom decided that was his best plan, and plodded on through the thick
sand. He had not gone more than a quarter of a mile, every step
seeming harder than the preceding one, when he heard, from the woods
close at his left hand, a gun fired. He jumped so that he nearly let
the motor-cycle fall over, for a wild idea came into his head that
the tramp had shot at him. With a quickly-beating heart the lad
looked about him.

"I wonder if that was Happy Harry?" he mused.

There was a crackling in the bushes and Tom, wondering what he might
do to protect himself, looked toward the place whence the noise
proceeded. A moment later a hunter stepped into view. The man
carried a gun and wore a canvas suit, a belt about his waist being
filled with cartridges.

"Hello!" he exclaimed pleasantly, Then, seeing a look of alarm on
the lad's face, he went on:

"I hope I didn't shoot in your direction, young man; did I?"

"No--no, sir," replied the youthful inventor, who had hardly
recovered his composure. "I heard your gun, and I imagined--"

"Did you think you had been shot? You must have a very vivid
imagination, for I fired in the air."

"No, I didn't exactly think that," replied Tom, "but I just had an
encounter with an ugly tramp, and I feared he might be using me for
a target."

"Is that so. I hadn't noticed any tramps around here, and I've been
in these woods nearly all day. Did he harm you?"

"No, not me, but my motor-cycle," and the lad explained.

"Pshaw! That's too bad!" exclaimed the hunter. "I wish I could
supply you with a bit of wire, but I haven't any. I'm just walking
about, trying my new gun."

"I shouldn't think you'd find anything to shoot this time of year,"
remarked Tom.

"I don't expect to," answered the hunter, who had introduced himself
as Theodore Duncan. "But I have just purchased a new gun, and I
wanted to try it. I expect to do considerable hunting this fall, and
so I'm getting ready for it."

"Do you live near here?"

"Well, about ten miles away, on the other side of Lake Carlopa, but
I am fond of long walks in the woods. If you ever get to Waterford I
wish you'd come and see me, Mr. Swift. I have heard of your father."

"I will, Mr. Duncan; but if I don't get something to repair my
machine with I'm not likely to get anywhere right away."

"Well, I wish I could help you, but I haven't the least ingenuity
when it comes to machinery. Now if I could help you track down that
tramp--"

"Oh, no, thank you, I'd rather not have anything more to do with
him."

"If I caught sight of him now," resumed the hunter, "I fancy I could
make him halt, and, perhaps, give you back the wire. I'm a pretty
good shot, even if this is a new gun. I've been practicing at
improvised targets all day."

"No; the less I have to do with him, the better I shall like it,"
answered Tom, "though I'm much obliged to you. I'll manage somehow
until I get to Pompville."

He started off again, the hunter disappearing in the woods, whence
the sound of his gun was again heard.

"He's a queer chap," murmured Tom, "but I like him. Perhaps I may
see him when I go to Waterford, if I ever do."

Tom was destined to see the hunter again, at no distant time, and
under strange circumstances. But now the lad's whole attention was
taken up with the difficulty in which he found himself. Vainly
musing on what object the tramp could have had in breaking off the
wire, the young inventor trudged on.

"I guess he was one of the gang after dad's invention," thought Tom,
"and he must have wanted to hinder me from getting to Albany, though
why I can't imagine." With a dubious shake of his head Tom
proceeded. It was hard work pushing the heavy machine through the
sand, and he was puffing before he had gone very far.

"I certainly am up against it," he murmured. "But if I can get a bit
of wire in Pompville I'll be all right. If I can't--"

Just then Tom saw something which caused him to utter an exclamation
of delight.

"That's the very thing!" he cried. "Why didn't I think of it
before?"

Leaving his motor-cycle standing against a tree Tom hurried to a
fence that separated the road from a field. The fence was a barbed-wire
one, and in a moment Tom had found a broken strand.

"Guess no one will care if I take a piece of this," he reasoned. "It
will answer until I can get more. I'll have it in place in a jiffy!"

It did not take long to get his pliers from his toolbag and snip off
a piece of the wire. Untwisting it he took out the sharp barbs, and
then was ready to attach it to the binding posts of the battery box
and the spark plug.

"Hold on, though!" he exclaimed as he paused in the work. "It's got
to be insulated, or it will vibrate against the metal of the machine
and short circuit. I have it! My handkerchief! I s'pose Mrs. Baggert
will kick at tearing up a good one, but I can't help it."

Tom took a spare handkerchief from the bundle in which he had a few
belongings carried with the idea of spending the night at an Albany
hotel, and he was soon wrapping strips of linen around the wire,
tying them with pieces of string.

"There!" he exclaimed at length. "That's insulated good enough, I
guess. Now to fasten it on and start."

The young inventor, who was quick with tools, soon had the
improvised wire in place. He tested the spark and found that it was
almost as good as when the regular copper conductor was in place.
Then, having taken a spare bit of the barbed-wire along in case of
another emergency, he jumped on the motor-cycle, pedaled it until
sufficient speed was attained, and turned on the power.

"That's the stuff!" he cried as the welcome explosions sounded. "I
guess I've fooled Happy Harry! I'll get to Albany pretty nearly on
time, anyhow. But that tramp surely had me worried for a while."

He rode into Pompville, and on inquiring in a plumbing shop managed
to get a bit of copper wire that answered better than did the
galvanized piece from the fence. The readjustment was quickly made,
and he was on his way again. As it was getting close to noon he
stopped near a little spring outside of Pompville and ate a
sandwich, washing it down with the cold water. Then he started for
Centreford.

As he was coming into the city he heard an automobile behind him. He
steered to one side of the road to give the big car plenty of room
to pass, but it did not come on as speedily as he thought it would.
He looked back and saw that it was going to stop near him.
Accordingly he shut off the power of his machine.

"Is this the road to Centreford?" asked one of the travelers in the
auto.

"Straight ahead," answered the lad.

At the sound of his voice one of the men in the big touring car
leaned forward and whispered something to one on the front seat. The
second man nodded, and looked closely at Tom. The youth, in turn,
stared at the men. He could not distinguish their faces, as they had
on auto goggles.

"How many miles is it?" asked the man who had whispered, and at the
sound of his voice Tom felt a vague sense that he had heard it
before.

"Three," answered the young inventor, and once more he saw the men
whisper among themselves.

"Thanks," spoke the driver of the car, and he threw in the gears. As
the big machine darted ahead the goggles which one of the men wore
slipped off. Tom had a glimpse of his face.

"Anson Morse!" he exclaimed. "If that isn't the man who was sneaking
around dad's motor shop he's his twin brother! I wonder if those
aren't the men who are after the patent model? I must be on my
guard!" and Tom, watching the car fade out of sight on the road
ahead of him, slowly started his motor-cycle. He was much puzzled
and alarmed.




CHAPTER XIII.

CAUGHT IN A STORM


The more Tom tried to reason out the cause of the men's actions, the
more he dwelt upon his encounter with the tramp, and the harder he
endeavored to seek a solution of the queer puzzle, the more
complicated it seemed. He rode on until he saw in a valley below him
the buildings of the town of Centreford, and, with a view of them, a
new idea came into his mind.

"I'll go get a good dinner," he decided, "and perhaps that will help
me to think more clearly. That's what dad always does when he's
puzzling over an invention." He was soon seated in a restaurant,
where he ate a substantial dinner. "I'm just going to stop puzzling
over this matter," he decided. "I'll push on to Albany and tell the
lawyer, Mr. Crawford. Perhaps he can advise me."

Once this decision was made Tom felt better.

"That's just what I needed," he thought; "some one to shift the
responsibility upon. I'll let the lawyers do the worrying. That's
what they're paid for. Now for Albany, and I hope I don't have to
stop, except for supper, until I get there. I've got to do some
night riding, but I've got a powerful lamp, and the roads from now
on are good."

Tom was soon on his way again. The highway leading to Albany was a
hard, macadam one, and he fairly flew along the level stretches.

"This is making good time," he thought. "I won't be so very late,
after all; that is, if nothing delays me."

The young inventor looked up into the sky. The sun, which had been
shining brightly all day, was now hidden behind a mass of hazy
clouds, for which the rider was duly grateful, as it was becoming
quite warm.

"It's more like summer than I thought," said Tom to himself. "I
shouldn't be surprised if we got rain to-morrow."

Another look at the sky confirmed him in this belief, and he had not
gone on many miles farther when his opinion was suddenly changed.
This was brought about by a dull rumble in the west, and Tom noticed
that a bank of low-lying clouds had formed, the black, inky masses
of vapor being whirled upward as if by some powerful blast.

"Guess my storm is going to arrive ahead of time," he said. "I'd
better look for shelter."

With a suddenness that characterizes summer showers, the whole sky
became overcast. The thunder increased, and the flashes of lightning
became more frequent and dazzling. A wind sprang up and blew clouds
of dust in Tom's face.

"It certainly is going to be a thunder storm," he admitted. "I'm
bound to be delayed now, for the roads will be mucky. Well, there's
no help for it. If I get to Albany before midnight I'll be doing
well."

A few drops of rain splashed on his hands, and as he looked up to
note the state of the sky others fell in his face. They were big
drops, and where they splashed on the road they formed little
globules of mud.

"I'll head for that big tree," thought Tom "It will give me some
shelter. I'll wait there--" His words were interrupted by a
deafening crash of thunder which followed close after a blinding
flash. "No tree for mine!" murmured Tom. "I forgot that they're
dangerous in a storm. I wonder where I can stay?"

He turned on all the power possible and sprinted ahead. Around a
curve in the road he went, leaning over to preserve his balance, and
just as the rain came pelting down in a torrent he saw just ahead of
him a white church on the lonely country road. To one side was a
long shed, where the farmers were in the habit of leaving their
teams when they came to service.

"Just the thing!" cried the boy; "and just in time!"

He turned his motor-cycle into the yard surrounding the church, and
a moment later had come to a stop beneath the shed. It was broad and
long, furnishing a good protection against the storm, which had now
burst in all its fury.

Tom was not very wet, and looking to see that the model, which was
partly of wood, had suffered no damage, the lad gave his attention
to his machine.

"Seems to be all right," he murmured. "I'll just oil her up while
I'm waiting. This can't last long; it's raining too hard."

He busied himself over the motor-cycle, adjusting a nut that had
been rattled loose, and putting some oil on the bearings. The rain
kept up steadily, and when he had completed his attentions to his
machine Tom looked out from under the protection of the shed.

"It certainly is coming down for keeps," he murmured. "This trip is
a regular hoodoo so far. Hope I have it better coming back."

As he looked down the road he espied an automobile coming through
the mist of rain. It was an open car, and as he saw the three men in
it huddled up under the insufficient protection of some blankets,
Tom said:

"They'd ought to come in here. There's lots of room. Maybe they
don't see it. I'll call to them."

The car was almost opposite the shed which was close to the roadside.
Tom was about to call when one of the men in the auto looked up. He
saw the shelter and spoke to the chauffeur. The latter was preparing
to steer up into the shed when the two men on the rear seat caught
sight of Tom.

"Why, that's the same car that passed me a while ago," said the
young inventor half aloud. "The one that contained those men whom I
suspected might be after dad's patent. I hope they--"

He did not finish his sentence, for at that instant the chauffeur
quickly swung the machine around and headed it back into the road.
Clearly the men were not going to take advantage of the shelter of
the shed.

"That's mighty strange," murmured Tom. "They certainly saw me, and
as soon as they did they turned away. Can they be afraid of me?"

He went to the edge of the shelter and peered out. The auto had
disappeared down the road behind a veil of rain, and, shaking his
head over the strange occurrence, Tom went back to where he had left
his motor-cycle.

"Things are getting more and more muddled," he said. "I'm sure those
were the same men, and yet--"

He shrugged his shoulders. The puzzle was getting beyond him.




CHAPTER XIV.

ATTACKED FROM BEHIND


Steadily the rain came down, the wind driving it under the shed
until Tom was hard put to find a place where the drops would not
reach him. He withdrew into a far corner, taking his motor-cycle with
him, and then, sitting on a block of wood, under the rough mangers
where the horses were fed while the farmers attended church, the lad
thought over the situation. He could make little of it, and the more
he tried the worse it seemed to become. He looked out across the wet
landscape.

"I wonder if this is ever going to stop?" he mused. "It looks as if
it was in for an all-day pour, yet we ought only to have a summer
shower by rights."

"But then I guess what I think about it won't influence the weather
man a bit. I might as well make myself comfortable, for I can't do
anything. Let's see. If I get to Fordham by six o'clock I ought to
be able to make Albany by nine, as it's only forty miles. I'll get
supper in Fordham, and push on. That is, I will if the rain stops."

That was the most necessary matter to have happen first, and Tom
arising from his seat strolled over to the front of the shed to look
out.

"I believe it is getting lighter in the west," he told himself.
"Yes, the clouds are lifting. It's going to clear. It's only a
summer shower, after all."

But just as he said that there came a sudden squall of wind and
rain, fiercer than any which had preceded. Tom was driven back to
his seat on the log. It was quite chilly now, and he noticed that
near where he sat there was a big opening in the rear of the shed,
where a couple of boards were off.

"This must be a draughty place in winter," he observed. "If I could
find a drier spot I'd sit there, but this seems to be the best," and
he remained there, musing on many things. Suddenly in the midst of
his thoughts he imagined he heard the sound of an automobile
approaching. "I wonder if those men are coming back here?" he
exclaimed. "If they are--"

The youth again arose, and went to the front of the shed. He could
see nothing, and came back to escape the rain. There was no doubt
but that the shower would soon be over, and looking at his watch,
Tom began to calculate when he might arrive in Albany.

He was busy trying to figure out the best plan to pursue, and was
hardly conscious of his surroundings. Seated on the log, with his
back to the opening in the shed, the young inventor could not see a
figure stealthily creeping up through the wet grass. Nor could he
see an automobile, which had come to a stop back of the horse
shelter--an automobile containing two rain-soaked men, who were
anxiously watching the one stealing through the grass.

Tom put his watch back into his pocket and looked out into the
storm. It was almost over. The sun was trying to shine through the
clouds, and only a few drops were falling. The youth stretched with
a yawn, for he was tired of sitting still. At the moment when he
raised his arms to relieve his muscles something was thrust through
the opening behind him. It was a long club, and an instant later it
descended on the lad's head. He went down in a heap, limp and
motionless.

Through the opening leaped a man. He bent over Tom, looked anxiously
at him, and then, stepping to the place where the boards were off
the shed, he motioned to the men in the automobile.

They hurried from the machine, and were soon beside their companion.

"I knocked him out, all right," observed the man who had reached
through and dealt Tom the blow with the club.

"Knocked him out! I should say you did, Featherton!" exclaimed one
who appeared better dressed than the others. "Have you killed him?"

"No; but I wish you wouldn't mention my name, Mr. Appleson. I--I
don't like--"

"Nonsense, Featherton. No one can hear us. But I'm afraid you've
done for the chap. I didn't want him harmed."

"Oh, I guess Featherton knows how to do it, Appleson," commented the
third man. "He's had experience that way, eh, Featherton?"

"Yes, Mr. Morse; but if you please I wish you wouldn't mention--"

"All right, Featherton, I know what you mean," rejoined the man
addressed as Morse. "Now let's see if we have drawn a blank or not.
I think he has with him the very thing we want."

"Doesn't seem to be about his person," observed Appleson, as he
carefully felt about the clothing of the unfortunate Tom.

"Very likely not. It's too bulky. But there's his motor-cycle over
there. It looks as if what we wanted was on the back of the saddle.
Jove, Featherton, but I think he's coming to!"

Tom stirred uneasily and moved his arms, while a moan came from
between his parted lips.

"I've got some stuff that will fix him!" exclaimed the man addressed
as Featherton, and who had been operating the automobile. He took
something from his pocket and leaned over Tom. In a moment the young
inventor was still again.

"Quick now, see if it's there," directed Morse, and Appleson hurried
over to the machine.

"Here it is!" he called. "I'll take it to our car, and we can get
away."

"Are you going to leave him here like this?" asked Morse.

"Yes; why not?"

"Because some one might have seen him come in here, and also
remember that we, too, came in this direction."

"What would you do?"

"Take him down the road a way and leave him. We can find some shed
near a farmhouse where he and his machine will be out of sight until
we get far enough away. Besides, I don't like to leave him so far
from help, unconscious as he is."

"Oh, you're getting chicken-hearted," said Appleson with a sneer.
"However, have your way about it. I wonder what has become of Jake
Burke? He was to meet us in Centreford, but he did not show up."

"Oh, I shouldn't be surprised if he had trouble in that tramp rig he
insisted on adopting. I told him he was running a risk, but he said
he had masqueraded as a tramp before."

"So he has. He's pretty good at it. Now, Simpson, if you will--"

"Not Simpson! I thought you agreed to call me Featherton,"
interrupted the chauffeur, turning to Morse and Appleson.

"Oh, so we did. I forgot that this lad met us one day, and heard me
call you Simpson," admitted Morse. "Well, Featherton it shall be.
But we haven't much time. It's stopped raining, and the roads will
soon be well traveled. We must get away, and if we are to take the
lad and his machine to some secluded place, we'd better be at it. No
use waiting for Burke. He can look out after himself. Anyhow, we
have the model now, and there's no use in him hanging around Swift's
shop, as he intended to do, waiting for a chance to sneak in after
it. Appleson, if you and Simpson--I mean Featherton--will carry
young Swift, I'll shove his wheel along to the auto, and we can put
it and him in."

The two men, first looking through the hole in the shed to make sure
they were not observed, went out, carrying Tom, who was no light
load. Morse followed them, pushing the motor-cycle, and carrying
under one arm the bundle containing the valuable model, which he had
detached.

"I think this is the time we get ahead of Mr. Swift," murmured
Morse, pulling his black mustache, when he and his companions had
reached the car in the field. "We have just what we want now."

"Yes, but we had hard enough work getting it," observed Appleson.
"Only by luck we saw this lad come in here, or we would have had to
chase all over for him, and maybe then we would have missed him.
Hurry, Simpson--I mean Featherton. It's getting late, and we've got
lots to do."

The chauffeur sprang to his seat, Appleson taking his place beside
him. The motor-cycle was tied on behind the big touring car, and
with the unconscious form of Tom in the tonneau, beside Morse, who
stroked his mustache nervously, the auto started off. The storm had
passed, and the sun was shining brightly, but Tom could not see it.




CHAPTER XV.

A VAIN SEARCH


Several hours later Tom had a curious dream. He imagined he was
wandering about in the polar regions, and that it was very cold. He
was trying to reason with himself that he could not possibly be on
an expedition searching for the North Pole, still he felt such a
keen wind blowing over his scantily-covered body that he shivered.
He shivered so hard, in fact, that he shivered himself awake, and
when he tried to pierce the darkness that enveloped him he was
startled, for a moment, with the idea that perhaps, after all, he
had wandered off to some unknown country.

For it was quite dark and cold. He was in a daze, and there was a
curious smell about him--an odor that he tried to recall. Then, all
at once, it came to him what it was--chloroform. Once his father had
undergone an operation, and to deaden his pain chloroform had been
used.

"I've been chloroformed!" exclaimed the young inventor, and his
words sounded strange in his ears. "That's it. I've met with an
accident riding my motor-cycle. I must have hit my head, for it
hurts fearful. They picked me up, carried me to a hospital and have
operated on me. I wonder if they took off an arm or leg? I wonder
what hospital I'm in? Why is it so dark and cold?"

As he asked himself these questions his brain gradually cleared from
the haze caused by the cowardly blow, and from the chloroform that
had been administered by Featherton.

Tom's first act was to feel first of one arm, then the other. Having
satisfied himself that neither of these members were mutilated he
reached down to his legs.

"Why, they're all right, too," he murmured. "I wonder what they did
to me? That's certainly, chloroform I smell, and my head feels as if
some one had sat on it. I wonder--"

Quickly he put up his hands to his head. There appeared to be
nothing the matter with it, save that there was quite a lump on the
back, where the club had struck.

"I seem to be all here," went on Tom, much mystified. "But where am
I? That's the question. It's a funny hospital, so cold and dark--"

Just then his hands came in contact with the cold ground on which he
was lying.

"Why, I'm outdoors!" he exclaimed. Then in a flash it all came back
to him--how he had gone to wait under the church shed until the rain
was over.

"I fell asleep, and now it's night," the youth went on. "No wonder I
am sore and stiff. And that chloroform--" He could not account for
that, and he paused, puzzled once more. Then he struggled to a
sitting position. His head was strangely dizzy, but he persisted,
and got to his feet. He could see nothing, and groped around in the
dark, until he thought to strike a match. Fortunately he had a
number in his pocket. As the little flame flared up Tom started in
surprise.

"This isn't the church shed!" he exclaimed. "It's much smaller! I'm
in a different place! Great Scott! but what has happened to me?"

The match burned Tom's fingers and he dropped it. The darkness
closed in once more, but Tom was used to it by this time, and
looking ahead of him he could make out that the shed was an open
one, similar to the one where he had taken shelter. He could see the
sky studded with stars, and could feel the cold night wind blowing
in.

"My motor-cycle!" he exclaimed in alarm. "The model of dad's
invention--the papers!"

Our hero thrust his hand into his pocket. The papers were gone!
Hurriedly he lighted another match. It took but an instant to glance
rapidly about the small shed. His machine was not in sight!

Tom felt his heart sink. After all his precautions he had been
robbed. The precious model was gone, and it had been his proposition
to take it to Albany in this manner. What would his father say?

The lad lighted match after match, and made a rapid tour of the
shed. The motor-cycle was not to be seen. But what puzzled Tom more
than anything else was how he had been brought from the church shed
to the one where he had awakened from his stupor.

"Let me try to think," said the boy, speaking aloud, for it seemed
to help him. "The last I remember is seeing that automobile, with
those mysterious men in, approaching. Then it disappeared in the
rain. I thought I heard it again, but I couldn't see it. I was
sitting on the log, and--and--well, that's all I can remember. I
wonder if those men--"

The young inventor paused. Like a flash it came to him that the men
were responsible for his predicament. They had somehow made him
insensible, stolen his motor-cycle, the papers and the model, and
then brought him to this place, wherever it was. Tom was a shrewd
reasoner, and he soon evolved a theory which he afterward learned
was the correct one. He reasoned out almost every step in the crime
of which he was the victim, and at last came to the conclusion that
the men had stolen up behind the shed and attacked him.

"Now, the next question to settle," spoke Tom, "is to learn where I
am. How far did those scoundrels carry me, and what has become of my
motor-cycle?"

He walked toward the point of the shed where he could observe the
stars gleaming, and there he lighted some more matches, hoping he
might see his machine. By the gleam of the little flame he noted
that he was in a farmyard, and he was just puzzling his brain over
the question as to what city or town he might be near when he heard
a voice shouting:

"Here, what you lightin' them matches for? You want to set the place
afire? Who be you, anyhow--a tramp?"

It was unmistakably the voice of a farmer, and Tom could hear
footsteps approaching on the run.

"Who be you, anyhow?" the voice repeated. "I'll have the constable
after you in a jiffy if you're a tramp."

"I'm not a tramp," called Tom promptly. "I've met with an accident.
Where am I?"

"Humph! Mighty funny if you don't know where you are," commented the
farmer. "Jed, bring a lantern until I take a look at who this is."

"All right, pop," answered another voice, and a moment later Tom saw
a tall man standing in front of him.

"I'll give you a look at me without waiting for the lantern," said
Tom quickly, and he struck a match, holding it so that the gleam
fell upon his face.

"Salt mackerel! It's a young feller!" exclaimed the farmer. "Who be
you, anyhow, and what you doin' here?"

"That's just what I would like to know," said Tom, passing his hand
over his head, which was still paining him. "Am I near Albany?
That's where I started for this morning."

"Albany? You're a good way from Albany," replied the farmer. "You're
in the village of Dunkirk."

"How far is that from Centreford?"

"About seventy miles."

"As far as that?" cried Tom. "They must have carried me a good way
in their automobile."

"Was you in that automobile?" demanded the farmer.

"Which one?" asked Tom quickly.

"The one that stopped down the road just before supper. I see it,
but I didn't pay no attention to it. If I'd 'a' knowed you fell out,
though, I'd 'a' come to help you."

"I didn't fall out, Mr.--er--" Tom paused.

"Blackford is my name; Amos Blackford."

"Well, Mr. Blackford, I didn't fall out. I was drugged and brought
here."

"Drugged! Salt mackerel! But there's been a crime committed, then.
Jed, hurry up with that lantern an' git your deputy sheriff's badge
on. There's been druggin' an' all sorts of crimes committed. I've
caught one of the victims. Hurry up! My son's a deputy sheriff," he
added, by way of an explanation.

"Then I hope he can help me catch the scoundrels who robbed me,"
said Tom.

"Robbed you, did they? Hurry up, Jed. There's been a robbery! We'll
rouse the neighborhood an' search for the villains. Hurry up, Jed!"

"I'd rather find my motor-cycle, and a valuable model which was on
it, than locate those men," went on Tom. "They also took some papers
from me."

Then he told how he had started for Albany, adding his theory of how
he had been attacked and carried away in the auto. The latter part
of it was borne out by the testimony of Mr. Blackford.

"What I know about it," said the farmer, when his son Jed had
arrived on the scene with a lantern and his badge, "is that jest
about supper time I saw an automobile stop down the road a bit, It
was gittin' dusk, an' I saw some men git out. I didn't pay no
attention to them, 'cause I was busy about the milkin'. The next I
knowed I seen some one strikin' matches in my wagon shed, an' I come
out to see what it was."

"The men must have brought me all the way from the church shed near
Centreford to here," declared Tom. "Then they lifted me out and put
me in your shed. Maybe they left my motor-cycle also."

"I didn't see nothin' like that," said the farmer. "Is that what you
call one of them two-wheeled lickity-split things that a man sits on
the middle of an' goes like chain-lightning?"

"It is," said Tom. "I wish you'd help me look for it."

The farmer and his son agreed, and other lanterns having been
secured, a search was made. After about half an hour the motor-cycle
was discovered in some bushes at the side of the road, near where
the automobile had stopped. But the model was missing from it, and a
careful search near where the machine had been hidden did not reveal
it. Nor did as careful a hunt as they could make in the darkness
disclose any clues to the scoundrels who had drugged and robbed Tom.




CHAPTER XVI.

BACK HOME


"We've got to organize a regular searchin' party," declared Jed
Blackford, after he and his father, together with Tom and the
farmer's hired man, had searched up and down the road by the light
of lanterns. "We'll organize a posse an' have a regular hunt. This
is the worst crime that's been committed in this deestrict in many
years, an' I'm goin' to run the scoundrels to earth."

"Don't be talkin' nonsense, Jed," interrupted his father. "You won't
catch them fellers in a hundred years. They're miles an' miles away
from here by this time in their automobile. All you can do is to
notify the sheriff. I guess we'd better give this young man some
attention. Let's see, you said your name was Quick, didn't you?"

"No, but it's very similar," answered Tom with a smile. "It's
Swift."

"I knowed it was something had to do with speed," went on Mr.
Blackford. "Wa'al, now, s'pose you come in the house an' have a hot
cup of tea. You look sort of draggled out."

Tom was glad enough to avail himself of the kind invitation, and he
was soon in the comfortable kitchen, relating his story, with more
detail, to the farmer and his family. Mrs. Blackford applied some
home-made remedies to the lump on the youth's head, and it felt much
better.

"I'd like to take a look at my motor-cycle," he said, after his
second cup of tea. "I want to see if those men damaged it any. If
they have I'm going to have trouble getting back home to tell my
father of my bad luck. Poor dad! He will be very much worried when I
tell him the model and his patent papers have been stolen."

"It's too bad!" exclaimed Mrs. Blackford. "I wish I had hold of them
scoundrels!" and her usually gentle face bore a severe frown. "Of
course you can have your thing-a-ma-bob in to see if it's hurt, but
please don't start it in here. They make a terrible racket."

"No, I'll look it over in the woodshed," promised Tom. "If it's all
right I think I'll start back home at once."

"No, you can't do that," declared Mr. Blackford. "You're in no
condition to travel. You might fall off an' git hurt. It's nearly ten
o'clock now. You jest stay here all night, an' in the mornin', if you
feel all right, you can start off. I couldn't let you go to-night."

Indeed, Tom did not feel very much like undertaking the journey, for
the blow on his head had made him dazed, and the chloroform caused a
sick feeling. Mr. Blackford wheeled the motor-cycle into the
woodhouse, which opened from the kitchen, and there the youth went
over the machine. He was glad to find that it had sustained no
damage. In the meanwhile Jed had gone off to tell the startling news
to near-by farmers. Quite a throng, with lanterns, went up and down
the road, but all the evidence they could find were the marks of the
automobile wheels, which clues were not very satisfactory.

"But we'll catch them in the mornin'," declared the deputy sheriff.
"I'll know that automobile again if I see it. It was painted red."

"That's the color of a number of automobiles," said Tom with a
smile. "I'm afraid you'll have trouble identifying it by that means.
I am surprised, though, that they did not carry my motor-cycle away
with them. It is a valuable machine."

"They were afraid to," declared Jed. "It would look queer to see a
machine like that in an auto. Of course when they were going along
country roads in the evening it didn't much matter, but when they
headed for the city, as they probably did, they knew it would
attract suspicion to 'em. I know, for I've been a deputy sheriff
'most a year."

"I believe you're right," agreed Tom. "They didn't dare take the
motor-cycle with them, but they hid it, hoping I would not find it.
I'd rather have the model and the papers, though, than half a dozen
motor-cycles."

"Maybe the police will help you find them," said Mrs. Blackford.
"Jed, you must telephone to the police the first thing in the
morning. It's a shame the way criminals are allowed to go on. If
honest people did those things, they'd be arrested in a minute, but
it seems that scoundrels can do as they please."

"You wait; I'll catch 'em!" declared Jed confidently. "I'll organize
another posse in the mornin'."

"Well, I know one thing, and that is that the place for this young
man is in bed!" exclaimed motherly Mrs. Blackford, and she insisted
on Tom retiring. He was somewhat restless at first, and the thought
of the loss of the model and the papers preyed on his mind. Then,
utterly exhausted, he sank into a heavy slumber, and did not awaken
until the sun was shining in his window the next morning. A good
breakfast made him feel somewhat better, and he was more like the
resourceful Tom Swift of old when he went to get his motor-cycle in
shape for the ride back to Shopton.

"Well, I hope you find those criminals," said Mr. Blackford, as he
watched Tom oiling the machine. "If you're ever out this way again,
stop off and see us."

"Yes, do," urged Mrs. Blackford, who was getting ready to churn. Her
husband looked at the old-fashioned barrel and dasher arrangement,
which she was filling with cream.

"What's the matter with the new churn?" he asked in some surprise.

"It's broken," she replied. "It's always the way with those new-fangled
things. It works ever so much nicer than this old one, though,"
she went on to Tom, "but it gets out of order easy."

"Let me look at it," suggested the young inventor. "I know something
about machinery."

The churn, which worked by a system of cogs and a handle, was
brought from the woodshed. Tom soon saw what the trouble was. One of
the cogs had become displaced. It did not take him five minutes,
with the tools he carried on his motor-cycle, to put it back, and
the churn was ready to use.

"Well, I declare!" exclaimed Mrs. Blackford. "You are handy at such
things!"

"Oh, it's just a knack," replied Tom modestly. "Now I'll put a plug
in there, and the cog wheel won't come loose again. The
manufacturers of it ought to have done that. I imagine lots of
people have this same trouble with these churns."

"Indeed they do," asserted Mrs. Blackford. "Sallie Armstrong has
one, and it got out of order the first week they had it. I'll let
her look at mine, and maybe her husband can fix it."

"I'd go and do it myself, but I want to get home," said Tom, and
then he showed her how, by inserting a small iron plug in a certain
place, there would be no danger of the cog coming loose again.

"That's certainly slick!" exclaimed Mr. Blackford. "Well, I wish you
good luck, Mr. Swift, and if I see those scoundrels around this
neighborhood again I'll make 'em wish they'd let you alone."

"That's what," added Jed, polishing his badge with his big, red
handkerchief.

Mrs. Blackford transferred the cream to the new churn which Tom had
fixed, and as he rode off down the highway on his motor-cycle, she
waved one hand to him, while with the other she operated the handle
of the apparatus.

"Now for a quick run to Shopton to tell dad the bad news," spoke Tom
to himself as he turned on full speed and dashed away. "My trip has
been a failure so far."




CHAPTER XVII.

MR. SWIFT IN DESPAIR


Tom was thinking of many things as his speedy machine carried him
mile after mile nearer home. By noon he was over half way on his
journey, and he stopped in a small village for his dinner.

"I think I'll make inquiries of the police here, to see if they
caught sight of those men," decided Tom as he left the restaurant.
"Though I am inclined to believe they kept on to Albany, or some
large city, where they have their headquarters. They will want to
make use of dad's model as soon as possible, though what they will
do with it I don't know." He tried to telephone to his father, but
could get no connection, as the wire was being repaired.

The police force of the place where Tom had stopped for lunch was
like the town itself--small and not of much consequence. The chief
constable, for he was not what one could call a chief of police, had
heard of the matter from the alarm sent out in all directions from
Dunkirk, where Mr. Blackford lived.

"You don't mean to tell me you're the young man who was chloroformed
and robbed!" exclaimed the constable, looking at Tom as if he
doubted his word.

"I'm the young man," declared our hero. "Have you seen anything of
the thieves?"

"Not a thing, though I've instructed all my men to keep a sharp
lookout for a red automobile, with three scoundrels in it. My men
are to make an arrest on sight."

"How many men have you?"

"Two," was the rather surprising answer; "but one has to work on a
farm daytimes, so I ain't really got but one in what you might call
active service."

Tom restrained a desire to laugh. At any rate, the aged constable
meant well.

"One of my men seen a red automobile, a little while before you come
in my office," went on the official, "but it wasn't the one wanted,
'cause a young woman was running it all alone. It struck me as
rather curious that a woman would trust herself all alone in one of
them things; wouldn't it you?"

"Oh, no, women and young ladies often operate them," said Tom.

"I should think you'd find one handier than the two-wheeled
apparatus you have out there," went on the constable, indicating the
motor-cycle, which Tom had stood up against a tree.

"I may have one some day," replied the young inventor. "But I guess
I'll be moving on now. Here's my address, in case you hear anything
of those men, but I don't imagine you will."

"Me either. Fellows as slick as them are won't come back this way
and run the chance of being arrested by my men. I have two on duty
nights," he went on proudly, "besides myself, so you see we're
pretty well protected."

Tom thanked him for the trouble he had taken, and was soon on his
way again. He swept on along the quiet country roads anxious for the
time when he could consult with his father over what would be the
best course to take.

When Tom was about a mile away from his house he saw in the road
ahead of him a rickety old wagon, and a second glance at it told him
the outfit belonged to Eradicate Sampson, for the animal drawing the
vehicle was none other than the mule, Boomerang.

"But what in the world is Rad up to?" mused Tom, for the colored man
was out of the wagon and was going up and down in the grass at the
side of the highway in a curious fashion. "I guess he's lost
something," decided Tom.

When he got nearer he saw what Eradicate was doing. The colored man
was pushing a lawn-mower slowly to and fro in the tall, rank grass
that grew beside the thoroughfare, and at the sound of Tom's
motor-cycle the negro looked up. There was such a woe-begone
expression on his face that Tom at once stopped his machine and got
off.

"What's the matter, Rad?" Tom asked.

"Mattah, Mistah Swift? Why, dere's a pow'ful lot de mattah, an'
dat's de truff. I'se been swindled, dat's what I has."

"Swindled? How?"

"Well, it's dis-a-way. Yo' see dis yeah lawn-moah?"

"Yes; it doesn't seem to work," and Tom glanced critically at it. As
Eradicate pushed it slowly to and fro, the blades did not revolve,
and the wheels slipped along on the grass.

"No, sah, it doan't work, an' dat's how I've been swindled, Mistah
Swift. Yo' see, I done traded mah ole grindstone off for dis yeah
lawn-moah, an' I got stuck."

"What, that old grindstone that was broken in two, and that you
fastened together with concrete?" asked Tom, for he had seen the
outfit with which Eradicate, in spare times between cleaning and
whitewashing, had gone about the country, sharpening knives and
scissors. "You don't mean that old, broken one?"

"Dat's what I mean, Mistah Swift. Why, it was all right. I mended it
so dat de break wouldn't show, an' it would sharpen things if yo'
run it slow. But dis yeah lawn-moah won't wuk slow ner fast."

"I guess it was an even exchange, then," went on Tom. "You didn't
get bitten any worse than the other fellow did."

"Yo' doan't s'pose yo' kin fix dis yeah moah so's I kin use it, does
yo', Mistah Swift?" asked Eradicate, not bothering to go into the
ethics of the matter. "I reckon now with summah comin' on I kin make
mo' with a lawn-moah than I kin with a grindstone--dat is, ef I kin
git it to wuk. I jest got it a while ago an' decided to try it, but
it won't cut no grass."

"I haven't much time," said Tom, "for I'm anxious to get home, but
I'll take a look at it."

Tom leaned his motor-cycle against the fence. He could no more pass
a bit of broken machinery, which he thought he could mend, than some
men and boys can pass by a baseball game without stopping to watch
it, no matter how pressed they are for time. It was Tom's hobby, and
he delighted in nothing so much as tinkering with machines, from
lawn-mowers to steam engines.

Tom took hold of the handle, which Eradicate gladly relinquished to
him, and his trained touch told him at once what was the trouble.

"Some one has had the wheels off and put them on wrong, Rad," he
said. "The ratchet and pawl are reversed. This mower would work
backwards, if that were possible."

"Am dat so, Mistah Swift?"

"That's it. All I have to do is to take off the wheels and reverse
the pawl."

"I--I didn't know mah lawn-moah was named Paul," said the colored
man. "Is it writ on it anywhere?"

"No, it's not the kind of Paul you mean," said Tom with a laugh.
"It's spelled differently. A pawl is a sort of catch that fits into
a ratchet wheel and pushes it around, or it may be used as a catch
to prevent the backward motion of a windlass or the wheel on a
derrick. I'll have it fixed in a jiffy for you."

Tom worked rapidly. With a monkey-wrench he removed the two big
wheels of the lawn-mower and reversed the pawl in the cogs. In five
minutes he had replaced the wheels, and the machine, except for
needed sharpening, did good work.

"There you are, Rad!" exclaimed Tom at length.

"Yo' suah am a wonder at inventin'!" cried the colored man
gratefully. "I'll cut yo' grass all summah fo' yo' to pay fo' this,
Mistah Swift."

"Oh, that's too much. I didn't do a great deal, Rad."

"Well, yo' saved me from bein' swindled, Mistah Swift, an' I suah
does 'preciate dat."

"How about the fellow you traded the cracked grindstone to, Rad?"

"Oh, well, ef he done run it slow it won't fly apart, an' he'll do
dat, anyhow, fo' he suah am a lazy coon. I guess we am about even
there, Mistah Swift."

"All right," spoke Tom with a laugh. "Sharpen it up, Rad, and start
in to cut grass. It will soon be summer," and Tom, leaping upon his
motor-cycle, was off like a shot.

He found his father in his library, reading a book on scientific
matters. Mr. Swift looked up in surprise at seeing his son.

"What! Back so soon?" he asked. "You did make a flying trip. Did you
give the model and papers to Mr. Crawford?"

"No, dad, I was robbed yesterday. Those scoundrels got ahead of us,
after all. They have your model. I tried to telephone to you, but
the wires were down, or something."

"What!" cried Mr. Swift. "Oh, Tom! That's too bad! I will lose ten
thousand dollars if I can't get that model and those papers back!"
and with a despairing gesture Mr. Swift rose and began to pace the
floor.




CHAPTER XVIII.

HAPPY HARRY AGAIN


Tom watched his father anxiously. The young inventor knew the loss
had been a heavy one, and he blamed himself for not having been more
careful.

"Tell me all about it, Tom," said Mr. Swift at length. "Are you sure
the model and papers are gone? How did it happen?"

Then Tom related what had befallen him.

"Oh, that's too bad!" cried Mr. Swift. "Are you much hurt, Tom?
Shall I send for the doctor?" For the time being his anxiety over
his son was greater than that concerning his loss.

"No, indeed, dad. I'm all right now. I got a bad blow on the head,
but Mrs. Blackford fixed me up. I'm awfully sorry---"

"There, there! Now don't say another word," interrupted Mr. Swift.
"It wasn't your fault. It might have happened to me. I dare say it
would, for those scoundrels seemed very determined. They are
desperate, and will stop at nothing to make good the loss they
sustained on the patent motor they exploited. Now they will probably
try to make use of my model and papers."

"Do you think they'll do that, dad?"

"Yes. They will either make a motor exactly like mine, or construct
one so nearly similar that it will answer their purpose. I will have
no redress against them, as my patent is not fully granted yet. Mr.
Crawford was to attend to that."

"Can't you do anything to stop them, dad? File an injunction, or
something like that?"

"I don't know. I must see Mr. Crawford at once. I wonder if he could
come here? He might be able to advise me. I have had very little
experience with legal difficulties. My specialty is in other lines
of work. But I must do something. Every moment is valuable. I wonder
who the men were?"

"I'm sure one of them was the same man who came here that night--the
man with the black mustache, who dropped the telegram," said Tom. "I
had a pretty good look at him as the auto passed me, and I'm sure it
was he. Of course I didn't see who it was that struck me down, but I
imagine it was some one of the same gang."

"Very likely. Well, Tom, I must do something. I suppose I might
telegraph to Mr. Crawford--he will be expecting you in Albany--" Mr.
Swift paused musingly. "No, I have it!" he suddenly exclaimed. "I'll
go to Albany myself."

"Go to Albany, dad?"

"Yes; I must explain everything to the lawyers and then he can
advise me what to do. Fortunately I have some papers, duplicates of
those you took, which I can show him. Of course the originals will
be necessary before I can prove my claim. The loss of the model is
the most severe, however. Without that I can do little. But I will
have Mr. Crawford take whatever steps are possible. I'll take the
night train, Tom. I'll have to leave you to look after matters here,
and I needn't caution you to be on your guard, though, having got
what they were after, I fancy those financiers, or their tools, will
not bother us again."

"Very likely not," agreed Tom, "but I will keep my eyes open, just
the same. Oh, but that reminds me, dad. Did you see anything of a
tramp around here while I was away?"

"A tramp? No; but you had better ask Mrs. Baggert. She usually
attends to them. She's so kind-hearted that she frequently gives
them a good meal."

The housekeeper, when consulted, said that no tramps had applied in
the last few days.

"Why do you ask, Tom?" inquired his father.

"Because I had an experience with one, and I believe he was a member
of the same gang who robbed me." And thereupon Tom told of his
encounter with Happy Harry, and how the latter had broken the wire
on the motor-cycle.

"You had a narrow escape," commented Mr. Swift. "If I had known the
dangers involved I would never have allowed you to take the model to
Albany."

"Well, I didn't take it there, after all," said Tom with a grim
smile, for he could appreciate a joke.

"I must hurry and pack my valise," went on Mr. Swift. "Mrs. Baggert,
we will have an early supper, and I will start at once for Albany."

"I wish I could go with you, dad, to make up for the trouble I
caused," spoke Tom.

"Tut, tut! Don't talk that way," advised his father kindly. "I will
be glad of the trip. It will ease my mind to be doing something."

Tom felt rather lonesome after his father had left, but he laid out
a plan of action for himself that he thought would keep him occupied
until his father returned. In the first place he made a tour of the
house and various machine shops to see that doors and windows were
securely fastened.

"What's the matter? Do you expect burglars, Master Tom?" asked
Garret Jackson, the aged engineer.

"Well, Garret, you never can tell," replied the young inventor, as
he told of his experience and the necessity for Mr. Swift going to
Albany. "Some of those scoundrels, finding how easy it was to rob
me, may try it again, and get some at dad's other valuable models.
I'm taking no chances."

"That's right, Master Tom. I'll keep steam up in the boiler to-night,
though we don't really need it, as your father told me you would
probably not run any machinery when he was gone. But with a good head
of steam up, and a hose handy, I can give any burglars a hot
reception. I almost wish they'd come, so I could get square with
them."

"I don't, Garret. Well, I guess everything is in good shape. If you
hear anything unusual, or the alarm goes off during the night, call
me."

"I will, Master Tom," and the old engineer, who had a living-room in
a shack adjoining the boiler-room, locked the door after Tom left.

The young inventor spent the early evening in attaching a new wire
to his motor-cycle to replace the one he had purchased while on his
disastrous trip. The temporary one was not just the proper thing,
though it answered well enough. Then, having done some work on a new
boat propeller he was contemplating patenting, Tom felt that it was
time to go to bed, as he was tired. He made a second round of the
house, looking to doors and windows, until Mrs. Baggert exclaimed:

"Oh, Tom, do stop! You make me nervous, going around that way. I'm
sure I shan't sleep a wink to-night, thinking of burglars and
tramps."

Tom laughingly desisted, and went up to his room. He sat up a few
minutes, writing a letter to a girl of his acquaintance, for, in
spite of the fact that the young inventor was very busy with his own
and his father's work, he found time for lighter pleasures. Then, as
his eyes seemed determined to close of their own accord, if he did
not let them, he tumbled into bed.

Tom fancied it was nearly morning when he suddenly awoke with a
start. He heard a noise, and at first he could not locate it. Then
his trained ear traced it to the dining-room.

"Why, Mrs. Baggert must be getting breakfast, and is rattling the
dishes," he thought. "But why is she up so early?"

It was quite dark in Tom's room, save for a little gleam from the
crescent moon, and by the light of this Tom arose and looked at his
watch.

"Two o'clock," he whispered. "That can't be Mrs. Baggert, unless
she's sick, and got up to take some medicine."

He listened intently. Below, in the dining-room, he could hear
stealthy movements.

"Mrs. Baggert would never move around like that," he decided. "She's
too heavy. I wonder--it's a burglar--one of the gang has gotten in!"
he exclaimed in tense tones. "I'm going to catch him at it!"

Hurriedly he slipped on some clothes, and then, having softly turned
on the electric light in his room, he took from a corner a small
rifle, which he made sure was loaded. Then, having taken a small
electric flashlight, of the kind used by police men, and sometimes
by burglars, he started on tiptoe toward the lower floor.

As Tom softly descended the stairs he could more plainly hear the
movements of the intruder. He made out now that the burglar was in
Mr. Swift's study, which opened from the dining-room.

"He's after dad's papers!" thought Tom. "I wonder which one this
is?"

The youth had often gone hunting in the woods, and he knew how to
approach cautiously. Thus he was able to reach the door of the
dining-room without being detected. He had no need to flash his
light, for the intruder was doing that so frequently with one he
carried that Tom could see him perfectly. The fellow was working at
the safe in which Mr. Swift kept his more valuable papers.

Softly, very softly Tom brought his rifle to bear on the back of the
thief. Then, holding the weapon with one hand, for it was very
light, Tom extended the electric flash, so that the glare would be
thrown on the intruder and would leave his own person in the black
shadows. Pressing the spring which caused the lantern to throw out a
powerful glow, Tom focused the rays on the kneeling man.

"That will be about all!" the youth exclaimed in as steady a voice
as he could manage.

The burglar turned like a flash, and Tom had a glimpse of his face.
It was the tramp--Happy Harry--whom he had encountered on the lonely
road.




CHAPTER XIX.

TOM ON A HUNT


Tom held his rifle in readiness, though he only intended it as a
means of intimidation, and would not have fired at the burglar
except to save his own life. But the sight of the weapon was enough
for the tramp. He crouched motionless. His own light had gone out,
but by the gleam of the electric he carried Tom could see that the
man had in his hand some tool with which he had been endeavoring to
force the safe.

"I guess you've got me!" exclaimed the intruder, and there was in
his tones no trace of the tramp dialect.

"It looks like it," agreed Tom grimly. "Are you a tramp now, or in
some other disguise?"

"Can't you see?" asked the fellow sullenly, and then Tom did notice
that the man still had on his tramp make-up.

"What do you want?" asked Tom.

"Hard to tell," replied the burglar calmly. "I hadn't got the safe
open before you came down and disturbed me. I'm after money,
naturally."

"No, you're not!" exclaimed Tom.

"What's that?" and the man seemed surprised.

"No, you're not!" went on Tom, and he held his rifle in readiness.
"You're after the patent papers and the model of the turbine motor.
But it's gone. Your confederates got it away from me. They probably
haven't told you yet, and you're still on the hunt for it. You'll
not get it, but I've got you."

"So I see," admitted Happy Harry, and he spoke with some culture.
"If you don't mind," he went on, "would you just as soon move that
gun a little? It's pointing right at my head, and it might go off."

"It is going off--very soon!" exclaimed Tom grimly, and the tramp
started in alarm. "Oh, I'm not going to shoot you," continued the
young inventor. "I'm going to fire this as an alarm, and the
engineer will come in here and tie you up. Then I'm going to hand
you over to the police. This rifle is a repeater, and I am a pretty
good shot. I'm going to fire once now, to summon assistance, and if
you try to get away I'll be ready to fire a second time, and that
won't be so comfortable for you. I've caught you, and I'm going to
hold on to you until I get that model and those papers back."

"Oh, you are, eh?" asked the burglar calmly. "Well, all I've got to
say is that you have grit. Go ahead. I'm caught good and proper. I
was foolish to come in here, but I thought I'd take a chance."

"Who are you, anyhow? Who are the men working with you to defraud my
father of his rights?" asked Tom somewhat bitterly.

"I'll never tell you," answered the burglar. "I was hired to do
certain work, and that's all there is to it. I'm not going to peach
on my pals."

"We'll see about that!" burst out Tom. Then he noticed that a
dining-room window behind where the burglar was kneeling was open.
Doubtless the intruder had entered that way, and intended to escape
in the same manner.

"I'm going to shoot," announced Tom, and, aiming his rifle at the
open window, where the bullet would do no damage, he pressed the
trigger. He noticed that the burglar was crouching low down on the
floor, but Tom thought nothing of this at the time. He imagined that
Happy Harry--or whatever his name was--might be afraid of getting
hit.

There was a flash of fire and a deafening report as Tom fired. The
cloud of smoke obscured his vision for a moment, and as the echoes
died away Tom could hear Mrs. Baggert screaming in her room.

"It's all right!" cried the young inventor reassuringly. "No one is
hurt, Mrs. Baggert!" Then he flashed his light on the spot where the
burglar had crouched. As the smoke rolled away Tom peered in vain
for a sight of the intruder.

Happy Harry was gone!

Holding his rifle in readiness, in case he should be attacked from
some unexpected quarter, Tom strode forward. He flashed his light in
every direction. There was no doubt about it. The intruder had fled.
Taking advantage of the noise when the gun was fired, and under
cover of the smoke, the burglar had leaped from the open window. Tom
guessed as much. He hurried to the casement and peered out, at the
same time noticing the cut wire of the burglar alarm. It was quite
dark, and he fancied he could hear the noise of some one running
rapidly. Aiming his rifle into the air, he fired again, at the same
time crying out:

"Hold on!"

"All right, Master Tom, I'm coming!" called the voice of the
engineer from his shack. "Are you hurt? Is Mrs. Baggert murdered? I
hear her screaming."

"That's pretty good evidence that she isn't murdered," said Tom with
a grim smile.

"Are you hurt?" again called Mr. Jackson.

"No, I'm all right," answered Tom. "Did you see any one running away
as you came up?"

"No, Master Tom, I didn't. What happened?"

"A burglar got in, and I had him cornered, but he got away when I
fired to arouse you."

By this time the engineer was at the stoop, on which the window
opened. Tom unlocked a side door and admitted Mr. Jackson, and then,
the incandescent light having been turned on, the two looked around
the apartment. Nothing in it had been disturbed, and the safe had
not been opened.

"I heard him just in time," commented Tom, telling the engineer what
had happened. "I wish I had thought to get between him and the
window. Then he couldn't have gotten away."

"He might have injured you, though," said Mr. Jackson. "We'll go
outside now, and look--"

"Is any one killed? Are you both murdered?" cried Mrs. Baggert at
the dining-room door. "If any one is killed I'm not coming in there.
I can't bear the sight of blood."

"No one is hurt," declared Tom with a laugh. "Come on in, Mrs.
Baggert," and the housekeeper entered, her hair all done up in curl
papers.

"Oh, my goodness me!" she exclaimed. "When I heard that cannon go
off I was sure the house was coming down. How is it some one wasn't
killed?"

"That wasn't a cannon; it was only my little rifle," said Tom, and
then he told again, for the benefit of the housekeeper, the story of
what had happened.

"We'd better hurry and look around the premises," suggested Mr.
Jackson. "Maybe he is hiding, and will come back, or perhaps he has
some confederates on the watch."

"Not much danger of that," declared Tom. "Happy Harry is far enough
away from here now, and so are his confederates, if he had any,
which I doubt. Still, it will do no harm to take a look around."

A search resulted in nothing, however, and the Swift household had
soon settled down again, though no one slept soundly during the
remainder of the night.

In the morning Tom sent word of what had happened to the police of
Shopton. Some officers came out to the house, but, beyond looking
wisely at the window by which the burglar had entered and at some
footprints in the garden, they could do nothing. Tom wanted to go
off on his motor-cycle on a tour of the surrounding neighborhood to
see if he could get any clues, but he did not think it would be wise
in the absence of his father. He thought it would be better to
remain at home, in case any further efforts were made to get
possession of valuable models or papers.

"There's not much likelihood of that, though," said Tom to the old
engineer. "Those fellows have what they want, and are not going to
bother us again. I would like to get that model back for dad,
though. If they file it and take out a patent, even if he can prove
that it is his, it will mean a long lawsuit and he may be defrauded
of his rights, after all. Possession is nine points of the law, and
part of the tenth, too, I guess."

So Tom remained at home and busied himself as well as he could over
some new machines he was constructing. He got a telegram from his
father that afternoon, stating that Mr. Swift had safely arrived in
Albany, and would return the following day.

"Did you have any luck, dad?" asked the young inventor, when his
father, tired and worn from the unaccustomed traveling, reached home
in the evening.

"Not much, Tom," was the reply. "Mr. Crawford has gone back to
Washington, and he is going to do what he can to prevent those men
taking advantage of me."

"Did you get any trace of the thieves? Does Mr. Crawford think he
can?"

"No to both questions. His idea is that the men will remain in
hiding for a while, and then, when the matter has quieted down, they
will proceed to get a patent on the motor that I invented."

"But, in the meanwhile, can't you make another model and get a
patent yourself?"

"No; there are certain legal difficulties in the way. Besides, those
men have the original papers I need. As for the model, it will take
me nearly a year to build a new one that will work properly, as it
is very complicated. I am afraid, Tom, that all my labor on the
turbine motor is thrown away. Those scoundrels will reap the benefit
of it."

"Oh, I hope not, dad! I'm sure those fellows will be caught. Now
that you are back home again, I'm going out on a hunt on my own
account. I don't put much faith in the police. It was through me,
dad, that you lost your model and the papers, and I'll get them
back!"

"No, you must not think it was your fault, Tom," said his father.
"You could not help it, though I appreciate your desire to recover
the missing model."

"And I'll do it, too, dad. I'll start to-morrow, and I'll make a
complete circuit of the country for a hundred miles around. I can
easily do it on my motor-cycle. If I can't get on the trail of the
three men who robbed me, maybe I can find Happy Harry."

"I doubt it, my son. Still, you may try. Now I must write to Mr.
Crawford and tell him about the attempted burglary while I was away.
It may give him a clue to work on. I'm afraid you ran quite a risk,
Tom."

"I didn't think about that, dad. I only wish I had managed to keep
that rascal a prisoner."

The next day Tom started off on a hunt. He planned to be gone
overnight, as he intended to go first to Dunkirk, where Mr.
Blackford lived, and begin his search from there.




CHAPTER XX.

ERADICATE SAWS WOOD


The farmer's family, including the son who was a deputy sheriff, was
glad to see Tom. Jed said he had "been on the job" ever since the
mysterious robbery of Tom had taken place, but though he had seen
many red automobiles he had no trace of the three men.

From Dunkirk Tom went back over the route he had taken in going from
Pompville to Centreford, and made some inquiries in the neighborhood
of the church shed, where he had taken shelter. The locality was
sparsely settled, however, and no one could give any clues to the
robbers.

The young inventor next made a trip over the lonely, sandy road,
where he had met with the tramp, Happy Harry. But there were even
fewer houses near that stretch than around the church, so he got no
satisfaction there. Tom spent the night at a country inn, and
resumed his search the next morning, but with no results. The men
had apparently completely disappeared, leaving no traces behind
them.

"I may as well go home," thought Tom, as he was riding his motor-cycle
along a pleasant country road. "Dad may be worried, and perhaps
something has turned up in Shopton that will aid me. If there isn't,
I'm going to start out again in a few days in another direction."

There was no news in Shopton, however. Tom found his father
scarcely able to work, so worried was he over the loss of his most
important invention.

Two weeks passed, the young machinist taking trips of several days'
duration to different points near his home, in the hope of
discovering something. But he was unsuccessful, and, in the
meanwhile, no reassuring word was received from the lawyers in
Washington. Mr. Crawford wrote that no move had yet been made by the
thieves to take out patent papers, and while this, in a sense, was
some aid to Mr. Swift, still he could not proceed on his own account
to protect his new motor. All that could be done was to await the
first movement on the part of the scoundrels.

"I think I'll try a new plan to-morrow, dad," announced Tom one
night, when he and his father had talked over again, for perhaps the
twentieth time, the happenings of the last few weeks.

"What is it, Tom?" asked the inventor.

"Well, I think I'll take a week's trip on my machine. I'll visit all
the small towns around here, but, instead of asking in houses for
news of the tramp or his confederates, I'll go to the police and
constables. I'll ask if they have arrested any tramps recently, and,
if they have, I'll ask them to let me see the 'hobo' prisoners."

"What good will that do?"

"I'll tell you. I have an idea that though the burglar who got in
here may not be a regular tramp, yet he disguises himself like one
at times, and may be known to other tramps. If I can get on the
trail of Happy Harry, as he calls himself, I may locate the other
men. Tramps would be very likely to remember such a peculiar chap as
Happy Harry, and they will tell me where they had last seen him.
Then I will have a starting point."

"Well, that may be a good plan," assented Mr. Swift. "At any rate it
will do no harm to try. A tramp locked up in a country police
station will very likely be willing to talk. Go ahead with that
scheme, Tom, but don't get into any danger. How long will you be
away?"

"I don't know. A week, perhaps; maybe longer. I'll take plenty of
money with me, and stop at country hotels overnight."

Tom lost no time in putting his plan into execution. He packed some
clothes in a grip, which he attached to the rear of his motor-cycle,
and then having said good-by to his father, started off. The first
three days he met with no success. He located several tramps in
country lock-ups, where they had been sent for begging or loitering,
but none of them knew Happy Harry or had ever heard of a tramp
answering his description.

"He ain't one of us, youse can make up your mind to dat," said one
"hobo" whom Tom interviewed. "No real knight of de highway goes
around in a disguise. We leaves dat for de story-book detectives.
I'm de real article, I am, an' I don't know Happy Harry. But, fer
dat matter, any of us is happy enough in de summer time, if we don't
strike a burgh like dis, where dey jugs you fer panhandlin'."

In general, Tom found the tramp willing enough to answer his
questions, though some were sullen, and returned only surly growls
to his inquiries.

"I guess I'll have to give it up and go back home," he decided one
night. But there was a small town, not many miles from Shopton,
which he had not yet visited, and he resolved to try there before
returning. Accordingly, the next morning found him inquiring of the
police authorities in Meadton. But no tramps had been arrested in
the last month, and no one had seen anything of a tramp like Happy
Harry or three mysterious men in an automobile.

Tom was beginning to despair. Riding along a silent road, that
passed through a strip of woods, he was trying to think of some new
line of procedure, when the silence of the highway, that, hitherto,
had resounded only with the muffled explosions of his machine, was
broken by several exclamations.

"Now, Boomerang, yo' might jest as well start now as later," Tom heard
a voice saying--a voice he recognized well. "Yo' hab got t' do dis
yeah wuk, an' dere ain't no gittin' out ob it. Dis yeah wood am got to
be sawed, an' yo' hab got to saw it. But it am jest laik yo' to go
back on yo' ole friend Eradicate in dis yeah fashion. I neber could
tell what yo' were gwine t' do next, an' I cain't now. G'lang, now,
won't yo'? Let's git dis yeah sawmill started."

Tom shut off the power and leaped from his wheel. From the woods at
his left came the protesting "hee-haw" of a mule.

"Boomerang and Eradicate Sampson!" exclaimed the young inventor.
"What can they be doing here?"

He leaned his motor-cycle against the fence and advanced toward
where he had heard the voice of the colored man. In a little
clearing he saw him. Eradicate was presiding over a portable
sawmill, worked by a treadmill, on the incline of which was the
mule, its ears laid back, and an unmistakable expression of anger on
its face.

"Why, Rad, what are you doing?" cried Tom.

"Good land o' massy! Ef it ain't young Mistah Swift!" cried the
darky. "Howdy, Mistah Swift! Howdy! I'm jest tryin' t' saw some
wood, t' make a livin', but Boomerang he doan't seem t' want t'
lib," and with that Eradicate looked reproachfully at the animal.

"What seems to be the trouble, and how did you come to own this
sawmill?" asked Tom.

"I'll tell yo', Mistah Swift, I'll tell yo'," spoke Eradicate. "Sit
right yeah on dis log, an' I'll explanation it to yo'."

"The last time I saw you, you were preparing to go into the grass-cutting
business," went on Tom.

"Yais, sah! Dat's right. So I was. Yo' has got a memory, yo' suah
has. But it am dis yeah way. Grass ain't growin' quick enough, an'
so I traded off dat lawn-moah an' bought dis yeah mill. But now it
won't go, an' I suah am in trouble," and once more Eradicate Sampson
looked indignantly at Boomerang.




CHAPTER XXI.

ERADICATE GIVES A CLUE


"Tell me all about it," urged Tom sympathetically, for he had a
friendly feeling toward the aged darky.

"Well," began Eradicate, "I suah thought I were gwine to make money
cuttin' grass, 'specially after yo' done fixed mah moah. But 'peared
laik nobody wanted any grass cut. I trabeled all ober, an' I
couldn't git no jobs. Now me an' Boomerang has to eat, no mattah ef
he is contrary, so I had t' look fo' some new wuk. I traded dat
lawn-moah off fo' a cross-cut saw, but dat was such hard wuk dat I
gib it up. Den I got a chance to buy dis yeah outfit cheap, an' I
bought it."

Eradicate then went on to tell how he had purchased the portable
sawmill from a man who had no further use for it, and how he had
managed to transport it from a distant village to the spot where Tom
had met him. There he had secured permission to work a piece of
woodland on shares, sawing up the smaller trees into cord wood. He
had started in well enough, cutting down considerable timber, for
the colored man was a willing worker, but when he tried to start his
mill he met with trouble.

"I counted on Boomerang helpin' me," he said to Tom. "All he has to
do is walk on dat tread mill, an' keep goin'. Dat makes de saw go
'round, an' I saws de wood. But de trouble am dat I can't git
Boomerang to move. I done tried ebery means I knows on, an' he won't
go. I talked kind to him, an' I talked harsh. I done beat him wif a
club, an' I rub his ears soft laik, an' he allers did laik dat, but
he won't go. I fed him on carrots an' I gib him sugar, an' I eben
starve him, but he won't go. Heah I been tryin' fo' three days now
t' git him started, an' not a stick hab I sawed. De man what I'm
wukin' wif on shares he git mad, an' he say ef I doan't saw wood
pretty soon he gwine t' git annuder mill heah. Now I axes yo' fair,
Mistah Swift, ain't I got lots ob trouble?"

"You certainly seem to have," agreed Tom "But why is Boomerang so
obstinate? Usually on a treadmill a horse or a mule has to work
whether they like it or not. If they don't keep moving the platform
slides out from under them, and they come up against the back bar."

"Dat's what done happened to Boomerang," declared Eradicate. "He
done back up against de bar, an' dere he stay."

Tom went over and looked at the mill. The outfit was an old one, and
had seen much service, but the trained eye of the young inventor saw
that it could still be used effectively. Boomerang watched Tom, as
though aware that something unusual was about to happen.

"Heah I done gone an' 'vested mah money in dis yeah mill,"
complained Eradicate, "an' I ain't sawed up a single stick. Ef I
wasn't so kind-hearted I'd chastise dat mule wuss dan I has, dat's
what I would."

Tom said nothing. He was stooping down, looking at the gearing that
connected the tread mill with the shaft which revolved the saw.
Suddenly he uttered an exclamation,

"Rad, have you been monkeying with this machinery?" he asked.

"Me? Good land, Mistah Swift, no, sah! I wouldn't tech it. It's jest
as I got it from de man I bought it off. It worked when he had it,
but he used a hoss. It's all due to de contrariness ob Boomerang,
an' if I--"

"No, it isn't the mule's fault at all!" exclaimed Tom. "The mill is
out of gear, and tread is locked; that's all. The man you bought it
off probably did it so you could haul it along the road. I'll have
it fixed for you in a few minutes. Wait until I get some tools."

From the bag on his motor-cycle Tom got his implements. He first
unlocked the treadmill, so that the inclined platform, on which the
animal slowly walked, could revolve. No sooner had he done this than
Boomerang, feeling the slats under his hoofs moving away, started
forward. With a rattle the treadmill slid around.

"Good land o' massy! It's goin'!" cried Eradicate delightedly. "It
suah am goin'!" he added as he saw the mule, with nimble feet, send
the revolving, endless string of slats around and around. "But de
saw doan't move, Mistah Swift. Yo' am pretty smart at fixin' it as
much as yo' has, but I reckon it's too busted t' eber saw any wood.
I'se got bad luck, dat's what I has."

"Nonsense!" exclaimed Tom. "The sawmill will be going in a moment.
All I have to do is to throw it into gear. See here, Rad. When you
want the saw to go you just throw this handle forward. That makes
the gears mesh."

"What's dat 'bout mush?" asked Eradicate.

"Mesh--not mush. I mean it makes the cogs fit together. See," and
Tom pressed the lever. In an instant, with a musical whirr, the saw
began revolving.

"Hurrah! Dere it goes! Golly! see de saw move!" cried the delighted
colored man. He seized a stick of wood, and in a trice it was sawed
through.

"Whoop!" yelled Eradicate. "I'm sabed now! Bless yo', Mistah Swift,
yo' suttinly am a wondah!"

"Now I'll show you how it works," went on Tom. "When you want to
stop Boomerang, you just pull this handle. That locks the tread, and
he can't move it," and, suiting the action to his words, Tom stopped
the mill. "Then," he went on, "when you want him to move, you pull
the handle this way," and he showed the darky how to do it. In a
moment the mule was moving again. Then Tom illustrated how to throw
the saw in and out of gear, and in a few minutes the sawmill was in
full operation, with a most energetic colored man feeding in logs to
be cut up into stove lengths.

"You ought to have an assistant, Rad," said Tom, after he had
watched the work for a while. "You could get more done then, and
move on to some other wood-patch."

"Dat's right, Mistah Swift, so I had. But I 'done tried, an'
couldn't git any. I ast seberal colored men, but dey'd radder
whitewash an' clean chicken coops. I guess I'll hab t' go it alone.
I ast a white man yisterday ef he wouldn't like t' pitch in an'
help, but he said he didn't like to wuk. He was a tramp, an' he had
de nerve to ask me fer money--me, a hard-wukin' coon."

"You didn't give it to him, I hope."

"No, indeedy, but he come so close to me dat I was askeered he might
take it from me, so I kept hold ob a club. He suah was a bad-lookin'
tramp, an' he kept laffin' all de while, like he was happy."

"What's that?" cried Tom, struck by the words of the colored man.
"Did he have a thick, brown beard?"

"Dat's what he had," answered Eradicate, pausing in the midst of his
work. "He suah were a funny sort ob tramp. His hands done looked
laik he neber wuked, an' he had a funny blue ring one finger, only
it wasn't a reg'lar ring, yo' know. It was pushed right inter his
skin, laik a man I seen at de circus once, all cobered wid funny
figgers."

Tom leaped to his feet.

"Which finger was the blue ring tattooed on?" he asked, and he
waited anxiously for the answer.

"Let me see, it were on de right--no, it were on de little finger ob
de left hand."

"Are you sure, Rad?"

"Suah, Mistah Swift. I took 'tic'lar notice, 'cause he carried a
stick in dat same hand."

"It must be my man--Happy Harry!" exclaimed Tom half aloud. "Which
way did he go, Rad, after he left you?"

"He went up de lake shore," replied the colored man. "He asked me if
I knowed ob an ole big house up dere, what nobody libed in, an' I
said I did. Den he left, an' I were glad ob it."

"Which house did you mean, Rad?"

"Why, dat ole mansion what General Harkness used t' lib in befo' de
wah. Dere ain't nobody libed in it fo' some years now, an' it's
deserted. Maybe a lot ob tramps stays in it, an' dat's where dis man
were goin'."

"Maybe," assented Tom, who was all excitement now. "Just where is
this old house, Rad?"

"Away up at de head ob Lake Carlopa. I uster wuk dere befo' de wah,
but it's been a good many years since quality folks libed dere. Why,
did yo' want t' see dat man, Mistah Swift?"

"Yes, Rad, I did, and very badly, too. I think he is the very person
I want. But don't say anything about it. I'm going to take a trip up
to that strange mansion. Maybe I'll get on the trail of Happy Harry
and the men who robbed me. I'm much obliged to you, Rad, for this
information. It's a good clue, I think. Strange that you should meet
the very tramp I've been searching for."

"Well, I suah am obliged to yo', Mistah Swift, fo' fixin' mah
sawmill."

"That's all right. What you told me more than pays for what I did,
Rad. Well, I'm going home now to tell dad, and then I'm going to start
out. Yesterday, you said it was, you saw Happy Harry? Well, I'll get
right after him," and leaving a somewhat surprised, but very much
delighted, colored man behind him, Tom mounted his motor-cycle and
started for home at a fast pace.




CHAPTER XXII.

THE STRANGE MANSION


"Dad, I've got a clue!" exclaimed Tom, hurrying into the house late
that afternoon, following a quick trip from where he had met
Eradicate with his sawmill. "A good clue, and I'm going to start
early in the morning to run it down."

"Wait a minute, now, Tom," cautioned his father slowly. "You know
what happens when you get excited. Nothing good was ever done in a
hurry."

"Well, I can't help being excited, dad. I think I'm on the trail of
those scoundrels. I almost wish I could start to-night."

"Suppose you tell me all about it," and Mr. Swift laid aside a
scientific book he was reading.

Whereupon Tom told of his meeting with the colored man, and what
Eradicate had said about the tramp.

"But he may not be the same Happy Harry you are looking for,"
interposed Mr. Swift. "Tramps who don't like to work, and who have a
jolly disposition, also those who ask for money and have designs
tattooed on their hands, are very common."

"Oh, but I'm sure this is the same one," declared Tom. "He wants to
stay in this neighborhood until he locates his confederates. That's
why he's hanging around. Now I have an idea that the deserted
mansion, where Eradicate used to work, and which once housed General
Harkness and his family, is the rendezvous of this gang of thieves."

"You are taking a great deal for granted, Tom."

"I don't think so, dad. I've got to assume something, and maybe I'm
wrong, but I don't think so. At any rate, I'm going to try, if
you'll let me."

"What do you mean to do?"

"I want to go to that deserted mansion and see what I can find. If I
locate the thieves, well--"

"You may run into danger."

"Then you admit I may be on the right track, dad?"

"Not at all," and Mr. Swift smiled at the quick manner in which Tom
turned the tables on him. "I admit there may be a band of tramps in
that house. Very likely there is--almost any deserted place would be
attractive to them. But they may not be the ones you seek. In fact,
I hardly see how they can be. The men who stole my model and patent
papers are wealthy. They would not be very likely to stay in
deserted houses."

"Perhaps some of the scoundrels whom they hired might, and through
them I can get on the track of the principals."

"Well, there is something in that," admitted Mr. Swift.

"Then may I go, dad?"

"I suppose so. We must leave nothing untried to get back the stolen
model and papers. But I don't want you to run any risks. If you
would only take some one with you. There's your chum, Ned Newton.
Perhaps he would go."

"No, I'd rather work it alone, dad. I'll be careful. Besides, Ned
could not get away from the bank. I may have to be gone a week, and
he has no motor-cycle. I can manage all right."

Tom was off bright and early. He had carefully laid his plans, and
had decided that he would not go direct to Pineford, which was the
nearest village to the old Harkness mansion.

"If those fellows are in hiding they will probably keep watch on who
comes to the village," thought Tom. "The arrival of some one on a
motor-cycle will be sure to be reported to them, and they may skip
out. I've got to come up from another direction, so I think I'll
circle around, and reach the mansion from the stretch of woods on
the north."

He had inquired from Eradicate as to the lay of the land, and had a
good general idea of it. He knew there was a patch of woodland on
one side of the mansion, while the other sides were open.

"I may not be able to ride through the woods," mused Tom, "but I'll
take my machine as close as I can, and walk the rest of the way.
Once I discover whether or not the gang is in the place, I'll know
what to do."

To follow out the plan he had laid down for himself meant that Tom
must take a roundabout way. It would necessitate being a whole day
on the road, before he would be near the head of Lake Carlopa, where
the Harkness house was located. The lake was a large one, and Tom
had never been to the upper end.

When he was within a few miles of Pineford, Tom took a road that
branched off and went around it. Stopping at night in a lonely
farmhouse, he pushed on the next morning, hoping to get to the woods
that night. But a puncture to one of the tires delayed him, and
after that was repaired he discovered something wrong with his
batteries. He had to go five miles out of his way to get new cells,
and it was dusk when he came to the stretch of woods which he knew
lay between him and the old mansion.

"I don't fancy starting in there at night," said Tom to himself.
"Guess I'd better stay somewhere around here until morning, and then
venture in. But the question is where to stay?"

The country was deserted, and for a mile or more he had seen no
houses. He kept on for some distance farther, the dusk falling
rapidly, and when he was about to turn back to retrace his way to
the last farmhouse he had passed, he saw a slab shanty at the side
of the road.

"That's better than nothing, provided they'll take me in for the
night," murmured Tom. "I'm going to ask, anyhow."

He found the shanty to be inhabited by an old man who made a living
burning charcoal. The place was not very attractive, but Tom did not
mind that, and finding the charcoal-burner a kindly old fellow, soon
made a bargain with him to remain all night.

Tom slept soundly, in spite of his strange surroundings, and after a
simple breakfast in the morning inquired of the old man the best way
of penetrating the forest.

"You'd best strike right along the old wood road," said the
charcoal-burner. "That leads right to the lake, and I think will
take you where you want to go. The old mansion is not far from the
lake shore."

"Near the lake, eh?" mused Tom as he started off, after thanking the
old fellow. "Now I wonder if I'd better try to get to it from the
water or the land side?"

He found it impossible to ride fast on the old wood road, and when he
judged he was so close to the lake that the noise of his motor-cycle
might be heard, he shut off the power, and walked along, pushing
it. It was hard traveling, and he felt weary, but he kept on, and
about noon was rewarded by a sight of something glittering through the
trees.

"That's the lake!" Tom exclaimed, half aloud. "I'm almost there."

A little later, having hidden his motor-cycle in a clump of bushes,
he made his way through the underbrush and stood on the shore of
Lake Carlopa. Cautiously Tom looked about him. It was getting well
on in the afternoon, and the sun was striking across the broad sheet
of water. Tom glanced up along the shore. Something amid a clump of
trees caught his eyes. It was the chimney of a house. The young
inventor walked a little distance along the lake shore. Suddenly he
saw, looming up in the forest, a large building. It needed but a
glance to show that it was falling into ruins, and had no signs of
life about it. Nor, for that matter, was there any life in the
forest around him, or on the lake that stretched out before him.

"I wonder if that can be the place?" whispered Tom, for, somehow,
the silence of the place was getting on his nerves. "It must be it,"
he went on. "It's just as Rad described it."

He stood looking at it, the sun striking full on the mysterious
mansion, hidden there amid the trees. Suddenly, as Tom looked, he
heard the "put-put" of a motor-boat. He turned to one side, and saw,
putting out from a little dock that he had not noticed before, a
small craft. It contained one man, and no sooner had the young
inventor caught a glimpse of him than he cried out:

"That's the man who jumped over our fence and escaped!"

Then, before the occupant of the boat could catch sight of him, Tom
turned and fled back into the bushes, out of view.




CHAPTER XXIII.

TOM IS PURSUED


Tom was so excited that he hardly knew what to do. His first thought
was to keep out of sight of the man in the boat, for the young
inventor did not want the criminals to suspect that he was on their
trail. To that end he ran back until he knew he could not be seen
from the lake. There he paused and peered through the bushes. He
caught a glimpse of the man in the motor-boat. The craft was making
fast time across the water.

"He didn't see me," murmured Tom. "Lucky I saw him first. Now what
had I better do?"

It was a hard question to answer. If he only had some one with whom
to consult he would have felt better, but he knew he had to rely on
himself. Tom was a resourceful lad, and he had often before been
obliged to depend on his wits. But this time very much was at stake,
and a false move might ruin everything.

"This is certainly the house," went on Tom, "and that man in the
boat is one of the fellows who helped rob me. Now the next thing to
do is to find out if the others of the gang are in the old mansion,
and, if they are, to see if dad's model and papers are there. Then
the next thing to do will be to get our things away, and I fancy
I'll have no easy job."

Well might Tom think this, for the men with whom he had to deal were
desperate characters, who had already dared much to accomplish their
ends, and who would do more before they would suffer defeat. Still,
they under-estimated the pluck of the lad who was pitted against
them.

"I might as well proceed on a certain plan, and have some system
about this affair," reasoned the lad. "Dad is a great believer in
system, so I'll lay out a plan and see how nearly I can follow it.
Let's see--what is the first thing to do?"

Tom considered a moment, going over the whole situation in his mind.
Then he went on, talking to himself alone there in the woods:

"It seems to me the first thing to do is to find out if the men are
in the house. To do that I've got to get closer and look in through
a window. Now, how to get closer?"

He considered that problem from all sides.

"It will hardly do to approach from the lake shore," he reasoned,
"for if they have a motor-boat and a dock, there must be a path from
the house to the water. If there is a path people are likely to walk
up or down it at any minute. The man in the boat might come back
unexpectedly and catch me. No, I can't risk approaching from the
lake shore. I've got to work my way up to the house by going through
the woods. That much is settled. Now to approach the house, and when
I get within seeing distance I'll settle the next point. One thing
at a time is a good rule, as dad used to say. Poor dad! I do hope I
can get his model and papers back for him."

Tom, who had been sitting on a log under a bush, staring at the
lake, arose. He was feeling rather weak and faint, and was at a loss
to account for it, until he remembered that he had had no dinner.

"And I'm not likely to get any," he remarked. "I'm not going to eat
until I see who's in that house. Maybe I won't then, and where
supper is coming from I don't know. But this is too important to be
considered in the same breath with a meal. Here goes."

Cautiously Tom made his way forward, taking care not to make too
much disturbance in the bushes. He had been on hunting trips, and
knew the value of silence in the woods. He had no paths to follow,
but he had noted the position of the sun, and though that luminary
was now sinking lower and lower in the west, he could see the gleam
of it through the trees, and knew in which direction from it lay the
deserted mansion.

Tom moved slowly, and stopped every now and then to listen. All the
sounds he heard were those made by the creatures of the woods--birds,
squirrels and rabbits. He went forward for half an hour, though
in that time he did not cover much ground, and he was just beginning
to think that the house must be near at hand when through a fringe
of bushes he saw the old mansion. It stood in the midst of what
had once been a fine park, but which was now overgrown with weeds
and tangled briars. The paths that led to the house were almost
out of sight, and the once beautiful home was partly in ruins.

"I guess I can sneak up there and take a look in one of the
windows," thought the young inventor. He was about to advance, when
he suddenly stopped. He heard some one or some thing coming around
the corner of the mansion. A moment later a man came into view, and
Tom easily recognized him as one of those who had been in the
automobile. The heart of the young inventor beat so hard that he was
afraid the man would hear it, and Tom crouched down in the bushes to
keep out of sight. The man evidently did not suspect the presence of
a stranger, for, though he cast sharp glances into the tangled
undergrowth that fringed the house like a hedge, he did not seek to
investigate further. He walked slowly on, making a circuit of the
grounds. Tom remained hidden for several minutes, and was about to
proceed again, when the man reappeared. Then Tom saw the reason for
it.

"He's on guard!" the lad said to himself. "He's doing sentry duty. I
can't approach the house when he's there."

For an instant Tom felt a bitter disappointment. He had hoped to be
able to carry out his plan as he had mapped it. Now he would have to
make a change.

"I'll have to wait until night," he thought. "Then I can sneak up
and look in. The guard won't see me after dark. But it's going to be
no fun to stay here, without anything to eat. Still, I've got to do
it."

He remained where he was in the bushes. Several times, before the
sun set, the man doing sentry duty made the circuit of the house,
and Tom noted that occasionally he was gone for a long period. He
reasoned that the man had gone into the mansion to confer with his
confederates.

"If I only knew what was going on in there," thought Tom. "Maybe,
after all, the men haven't got the model and papers here. Yet, if
they haven't, why are they staying in the old house? I must get a
look in and see what's going on. Lucky there are no shades to the
windows. I wish it would get dark."

It seemed that the sun would never go down and give place to dusk,
but finally Tom, crouching in his hiding place, saw the shadows grow
longer and longer, and finally the twilight of the woods gave place
to a density that was hard to penetrate. Tom waited some time to see
if the guard kept up the circuit, but with the approach of night the
man seemed to have gone into the house. Tom saw a light gleam out
from the lonely mansion. It came from a window on the ground floor.

"There's my chance!" exclaimed the lad, and, crawling from his
hiding place, he advanced cautiously toward it.

Tom went forward only a few feet at a time, pausing almost every
other step to listen. He heard no sounds, and was reassured. Nearer
and nearer he came to the old house. The gleam of the light fell
upon his face, and fearful that some one might be looking from the
window, he shifted his course, so as to come up from one side.
Slowly, very slowly he advanced, until he was right under the
window. Then he found that it was too high up to admit of his
looking in. He felt about until he had a stone to stand on.

Softly he drew himself up inch by inch. He could hear the murmur of
voices in the room. Now the top of his head was on a level with the
sill. A few more inches and his eyes could take in the room and the
occupants. He was scarcely breathing. Up, up he raised himself until
he could look into the apartment, and the sight which met his eyes
nearly caused him to lose his hold and topple backward. For grouped
around a table in a big room were the three men whom he had seen in
the automobile. But what attracted his attention more than the sight
of the men was an object on the table. It was the stolen model! The
men were inspecting it, and operating it, as he could see. One of
the trio had a bundle of papers in his hand, and Tom was sure they
were the ones stolen from him. But there could be no doubt about the
model of the turbine motor. There it was in plain sight. He had
tracked the thieves to their hiding place.

Then, as he watched, Tom saw one of the men produce from under the
table a box, into which the model was placed. The papers were next
put in, and a cover was nailed on. Then the men appeared to consult
among themselves.

By their gestures Tom concluded that they were debating where to
hide the box. One man pointed toward the lake, and another toward
the forest. Tom was edging himself up farther, in order to see
better, and, if possible, catch their words, when his foot slipped,
and he made a slight noise. Instantly the men turned toward the
window, but Tom had stooped down out of sight, just in time.

A moment later, however, he heard some one approaching through the
woods behind him, and a voice called out:

"What are you doing? Get away from there!"

Rapid footsteps sounded, and Tom, in a panic, turned and fled, with
an unknown pursuer after him.




CHAPTER XXIV.

UNEXPECTED HELP


Tom rushed on through the woods. The lighted room into which he had
been looking had temporarily blinded him when it came to plunging
into the darkness again, and he could not see where he was going. He
crashed full-tilt into a tree, and was thrown backward. Bruised and
cut, he picked himself up and rushed off in another direction.
Fortunately he struck into some sort of a path, probably one made by
cows, and then, as his eyes recovered their faculties, he could
dimly distinguish the trees on either side of him and avoid them.

His heart, that was beating fiercely, calmed down after his first
fright, and when he had run on for several minutes he stopped.

"That--that must--have been--the--the man--from the boat," panted
our hero, whispering to himself. "He came back and saw me. I wonder
if he's after me yet?"

Tom listened. The only sound he could hear was the trill and chirp
of the insects of the woods. The pursuit, which had lasted only a
few minutes, was over. But it might be resumed at any moment. Tom
was not safe yet, he thought, and he kept on.

"I wonder where I am? I wonder where my motor-cycle is? I wonder
what I had better do?" he asked himself.

Three big questions, and no way of settling them; Tom pulled himself
up sharply.

"I've got to think this thing out," he resumed. "They can't find me
in these woods to-night, that's sure, unless they get dogs, and
they're not likely to do that. So I'm safe that far. But that's
about all that is in my favor. I won't dare to go back to the house,
even if I could find it in this blackness, which is doubtful. It
wouldn't be safe, for they'll be on guard now. It looks as though I
was up against it. I'm afraid they may imagine the police are after
them, and go away. If they do, and take the model and papers with
them, I'll have an awful job to locate them again, and probably I
won't be able to. That's the worst of it. Here I have everything
right under my hands, and I can't do a thing. If I only had some one
to help me; some one to leave on guard while I went for the police.
I'm one against three--no, four, for the man in the boat is back.
Let's see what can I do?"

Then a sudden plan came to him.

"The lake shore!" he exclaimed, half aloud. "I'll go down there and
keep watch. If they escape they'll probably go in the boat, for they
wouldn't venture through the woods at night. That's it. I'll watch
on shore, and if they do leave in the boat--" He paused again,
undecided. "Why, if they do," he finished, "I'll sing out, and make
such a row that they'll think the whole countryside is after them.
That may drive them back, or they may drop the box containing the
papers and model, and cut for it. If they do I'll be all right. I
don't care about capturing them, if I can get dad's model back."

He felt more like himself, now that he had mapped out another plan.

"The first thing to do is to locate the lake," reasoned Tom. "Let's
see; I ran in a straight line away from the house--that is, as
nearly straight as I could. Now if I turn around and go straight
back, bearing off a little to the left, I ought to come to the
water. I'll do it."

But it was not so easy as Tom imagined, and several times he found
himself in the midst of almost impenetrable bushes. He kept on,
however, and soon had the satisfaction of emerging from the woods
out on the shore of the lake. Then, having gotten his bearings as
well as he could in the darkness, he moved down until he was near
the deserted house. The light was still showing from the window, and
Tom judged by this that the men had not taken fright and fled.

"I suppose I could sneak down and set the motor-boat adrift," he
argued. "That would prevent them leaving by way of the lake, anyhow.
That's what I'll do! I'll cut off one means of escape. I'll set the
boat adrift!"

Very cautiously he advanced toward where he had seen the small craft
put out. He was on his guard, for he feared the men would be on the
watch, but he reached the dock in safety, and was loosening the rope
that tied the boat to the little wharf when another thought came to
him.

"Why set this boat adrift?" he reasoned. "It is too good a boat to
treat that way, and, besides, it will make a good place for me to
spend the rest of the night. I've got to stay around here until
morning, and then I'll see if I can't get help. I'll just
appropriate this boat for my own use. They have dad's model, and
I'll take their boat."

Softly he got into the craft, and with an oar which was kept in it
to propel it in case the engine gave out, he poled it along the
shore of the lake until he was some distance away from the dock.

That afternoon he had seen a secluded place along the shore, a spot
where overhanging bushes made a good hiding place, and for this he
headed the craft. A little later it was completely out of sight, and
Tom stretched out on the cushioned seats, pulling a tarpaulin over
him. There he prepared to spend the rest of the night.

"They can't get away except through the woods now, which I don't
believe they'll do," he thought, "and this is better for me than
staying out under a tree. I'm glad I thought of it."

The youth, naturally, did not pass a very comfortable night, though
his bed was not a half bad one. He fell into uneasy dozes, only to
arouse, thinking the men in the old mansion were trying to escape.
Then he would sit up and listen, but he could hear nothing. It
seemed as if morning would never come, but at length the stars began
to fade, and the sky seemed overcast with a filmy, white veil. Tom
sat up, rubbed his smarting eyes, and stretched his cramped limbs.

"Oh, for a hot cup of coffee!" he exclaimed. "But not for mine,
until I land these chaps where they belong. Now the question is, how
can I get help to capture them?"

His hunger was forgotten in this. He stepped from the boat to a
secluded spot on the shore. The craft, he noted, was well hidden.

"I've got to go back to where I left my motor-cycle, jump on that,
and ride for aid," he reasoned. "Maybe I can get the charcoal-burner
to go for me, while I come back and stand guard. I guess that would
be the best plan. I certainly ought to be on hand, for there is no
telling when these fellows will skip out with the model, if they
haven't gone already. I hate to leave, yet I've got to. It's the
only way. I wish I'd done as dad suggested, and brought help. But
it's too late for that. Well, I'm off."

Tom took a last look at the motor-boat, which was a fine one. He
wished it was his. Then he struck through the woods. He had his
bearings now, and was soon at the place where he had left his
machine. It had not been disturbed. He caught a glimpse of the old
mansion on his way out of the woods. There appeared to be no one
stirring about it.

"I hope my birds haven't flown!" he exclaimed, and the thought gave
him such uneasiness that he put it from him. Pushing his heavy
machine ahead of him until he came to a good road, he mounted it,
and was soon at the charcoal-burner's shack. There came no answer to
his knock, and Tom pushed open the door. The old man was not in. Tom
could not send him for help.

"My luck seems to be against me!" he murmured. "But I can get
something to eat here, anyhow. I'm almost starved!"

He found the kitchen utensils, and made some coffee, also frying
some bacon and eggs. Then, feeling much refreshed, and having left
on the table some money to pay for the inroad he had made on the
victuals, he started to go outside.

As our hero stepped to the door he was greeted by a savage growl
that made him start in alarm.

"A dog!" he mused. "I didn't know there was one around."

He looked outside and there, to his dismay, saw a big,
savage-appearing bulldog standing close to where he had left his
motor-cycle. The animal had been sniffing suspiciously at the machine.

"Good dog!" called Tom. "Come here!"

But the bulldog did not come. Instead the beast stood still, showed
his teeth to Tom and growled in a low tone.

"Wonder if the owner can be near?" mused the young inventor. "That
dog won't let me get my machine, I am afraid."

Tom spoke to the animal again and again the dog growled and showed
his teeth. He next made a move as if to leap into the house, and Tom
quickly stepped back and banged shut the door.

"Well, if this isn't the worst yet!" cried the youth to himself.
"Here, just at the time I want to be off, I must be held up by such
a brute as that outside. Wonder how long he'll keep me a prisoner?"

Tom went to a window and peered out. No person had appeared and the
lad rightly surmised that the bulldog had come to the cottage alone.
The beast appeared to be hungry, and this gave Tom a sudden idea.

"Maybe if I feed him, he'll forget that I am around and give me a
chance to get away," he reasoned. "Guess I had better try that dodge
on him."

Tom looked around the cottage and at last found the remains of a
chicken dinner the owner had left behind. He picked up some of the
bones and called the bulldog. The animal came up rather
suspiciously. Tom threw him one bone, which he proceeded to crunch
up vigorously.

"He's hungry right enough," mused Tom. "I guess he'd like to sample
my leg. But he's not going to do it--not if I can help it."

At the back of the cottage was a little shed, the door to which
stood open. Tom threw a bone near to the door of this shed and then
managed to throw another bone inside the place. The bulldog found
the first bone and then disappeared after the second.

"Now is my time, I guess," the young inventor told himself, and
watching his chance, he ran from the cottage toward his motor-cycle.
He made no noise and quickly shoved the machine into the roadway.
Just as he turned on the power the bulldog came out of the shed,
barking furiously.

"You've missed it!" said Tom grimly as the machine started, and
quickly the cottage and the bulldog were left behind. The road was
rough for a short distance and he had to pay strict attention to
what he was doing.

"I've got to ride to the nearest village," he said. "It's a long
distance, and, in the meanwhile, the men may escape. But I can't do
anything else. I dare not tackle them alone, and there is no telling
when the charcoal-burner may come back. I've got to make speed,
that's all."

Out on the main road the lad sent his machine ahead at a fast pace.
He was fairly humming along when, suddenly, from around a curve in
the highway he heard the "honk-honk" of an automobile horn. For an
instant his heart failed him.

"I wonder if those are the thieves? Maybe they have left the house,
and are in their auto!" he whispered as he slowed down his machine.

The automobile appeared to have halted. As Tom came nearer the turn
he heard voices. At the sound of one he started. The voice
exclaimed:

"Bless my spectacles! What's wrong now? I thought that when I got this
automobile I would enjoy life, but it's as bad as my motor-cycle was
for going wrong! Bless my very existence, but has anything happened?"

"Mr. Damon!" exclaimed Tom, for he recognized the eccentric
individual of whom he had obtained the motor-cycle.

The next moment Tom was in sight of a big touring car, containing,
not only Mr. Damon, whom Tom recognized at once, but three other
gentlemen.

"Oh, Mr. Damon," cried Tom, "will you help me capture a gang of
thieves? They are in a deserted mansion in the woods, and they have
one of my father's patent models! Will you help me, Mr. Damon?"

"Why, bless my top-knots," exclaimed the odd gentleman. "If it isn't
Tom Swift, the young inventor! Bless my very happiness! There's my
motor-cycle, too! Help you? Why, of course we will. Bless my
shoe-leather! Of course we'll help you!"




CHAPTER XXV.

THE CAPTURE--GOOD-BY


Tom's story was soon told, and Mr. Damon quickly explained to his
friends in the automobile how he had first made the acquaintance of
the young inventor.

"But how does it happen that you are trusting yourself in a car like
this?" asked Tom. "I thought you were done with gasolene machines,
Mr. Damon."

"I thought so, too, Tom, but, bless my batteries, my doctor insisted
that I must get out in the open air. I'm too stout to walk, and I
can't run. The only solution was in an automobile, for I never would
dream of a motor-cycle. I wonder that one of mine hasn't run away
with you and killed you. But there! My automobile is nearly as bad.
We went along very nicely yesterday, and now, just when I have a
party of friends out, something goes wrong. Bless my liver! I do
seem to have the worst luck!"

Tom lost no time in looking for the trouble. He found it in the
ignition, and soon had it fixed. Then a sort of council of war was
held.

"Do you think those scoundrels are there yet?" asked Mr. Damon.

"I hope so," answered Tom.

"So do I," went on the odd character. "Bless my soul, but I want a
chance to pummel them. Come, gentlemen, let's be moving. Will you
ride with us, Tom Swift, or on that dangerous motor-cycle?"

"I think I'll stick to my machine, Mr. Damon. I can easily keep up
with you."

"Very well. Then we'll get along. We'll proceed until we get close
to the old mansion, and then some of us will go down to the lake
shore, and the rest of us will surround the house. We'll catch the
villains red-handed, and I hope we bag that tramp among them."

"I hardly think he is there," said Tom.

In a short time the auto and the motor-cycle had carried the
respective riders to the road through the woods. There the machines
were left, and the party proceeded on foot. Tom had a revolver with
him, and one member of Mr. Damon's party also had a small one, more
to scare dogs than for any other purpose. Tom gave his weapon to one
of the men, and cut a stout stick for himself, an example followed
by those who had no firearms.

"A club for mine!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "The less I have to do with
machinery the better I like it. Now, Tom Swift is just the other way
around," he explained to his friends.

Cautiously they approached the house, and when within seeing
distance of it they paused for a consultation. There seemed to be no
one stirring about the old mansion, and Tom was fearful lest the men
had left. But this could not be determined until they came closer.
Two of Mr. Damon's friends elected to go down to the shore of the
lake and prevent any escape in that direction, while the others,
including Tom, were to approach from the wood side. When the two who
were to form the water attacking party were ready, one of them was
to fire his revolver as a signal. Then Tom, Mr. Damon and the others
would rush in.

The young inventor, Mr. Damon, and his friend, whom he addressed as
Mr. Benson, went as close to the house as they considered prudent.
Then, screening themselves in the bushes, they waited. They
conversed in whispers, Tom giving more details of his experience
with the patent thieves.

Suddenly the silence of the woods was broken by some one advancing
through the underbrush.

"Bless my gaiters, some one is coming!" exclaimed Mr. Damon in a
hoarse whisper. "Can that be Munson or Dwight coming back?" He
referred to his two friends who had gone to the lake.

"Or perhaps the fellows are escaping," suggested Mr. Benson.
"Suppose we take a look."

At that moment the person approaching, whoever he was, began to
sing. Tom started.

"I'll wager that's Happy Harry, the tramp!" he exclaimed. "I know
his voice."

Cautiously Tom peered over the screen of bushes.

"Who is it?" asked Mr. Damon.

"It's Happy Harry!" said Tom. "We'll get them all, now. He's going
up to the house."

They watched the tramp. All unconscious of the eyes of the men and
boy in the bushes, he kept on. Presently the door of the house
opened, and a man came out. Tom recognized him as Anson Morse--the
person who had dropped the telegram.

"Say, Burke," called the man at the door, "have you taken the
motor-boat?"

"Motor-boat? No," answered the tramp. "I just came here. I've had a
hard time--nearly got caught in Swift's house the other night by
that cub of a boy. Is the boat gone?"

"Yes. Appleson came back in it last night and saw some one looking
in the window, but we thought it was only a farmer and chased him
away. This morning the boat's gone. I thought maybe you had taken it
for a joke."

"Not a bit of it! Something's wrong!" exclaimed Happy Harry. "We'd
better light out. I think the police are after us. That young Swift
is too sharp for my liking. We'd better skip. I don't believe that
was a farmer who looked in the window. Tell the others, get the
stuff, and we'll leave this locality."

"They're here still," whispered Tom. "That's good!"

"I wonder if Munson and Dwight are at the lake yet?" asked Mr.
Damon. "They ought to be--"

At that instant a pistol shot rang out. The tramp, after a hasty
glance around, started on the run for the house. The man in the
doorway sprang out. Soon two others joined him.

"Who fired that shot?" cried Morse.

"Come on, Tom!" cried Mr. Damon, grabbing up his club and springing
from the bushes. "Our friends have arrived!" The young inventor and
Mr. Benson followed him.

No sooner had they come into the open space in front of the house
than they were seen. At the same instant, from the rear, in the
direction of the lake, came Mr. Munson and Mr. Dwight.

"We're caught!" cried Happy Harry.

He made a dash for the house, just as a man, carrying a box, rushed
out.

"There it is! The model and papers are in that box!" cried Tom.
"Don't let them get away with it!"

The criminals were taken by surprise. With leveled weapons the
attacking party closed in on them. Mr. Damon raised his club
threateningly.

"Surrender! Surrender!" he cried. "We have you! Bless my stars, but
you're captured! Surrender!"

"It certainly looks so," admitted Anson Morse. "I guess they have
us, boys."

The man with the box made a sudden dash toward the woods, but Tom
was watching him. In an instant he sprang at him, and landed on the
fellow's back. The two went down in a heap, and when Tom arose he
had possession of the precious box.

"I have it! I have it!" he cried. "I've got dad's model back!"

The man who had had possession of the box quickly arose, and, before
any one could stop him, darted into the bushes.

"After him! Catch him! Bless my hat-band, stop him!" shouted Mr.
Damon.

Instinctively his friends turned to pursue the fugitive, forgetting,
for the instant, the other criminals. The men were quick to take
advantage of this, and in a moment had disappeared in the dense
woods. Nor could any trace be found of the one with whom Tom had
struggled.

"Pshaw! They got away from us!" cried Mr. Damon regretfully. "Let's
see if we can't catch them. Come on, we'll organize a posse and run
them down." He was eager for the chase, but his companions dissuaded
him. Tom had what he wanted, and he knew that his father would
prefer not to prosecute the men. The lad opened the box, and saw
that the model and papers were safe.

"Let those fellows go," advised the young inventor, and Mr. Damon
reluctantly agreed to this. "I guess we've seen the last of them,"
added the youth, but he and Mr. Swift had not, for the criminals
made further trouble, which will be told of in the second volume of
this series, to be called "Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat; or, The
Rivals of Lake Carlopa." In that our hero will be met in adventures
even more thrilling than those already related, and Andy Foger, who
so nearly ran Tom down in the automobile, will have a part in them.

"Now," said Mr. Damon, after it had been ascertained that no one was
injured, and that the box contained all of value that had been
stolen, "I suppose you are anxious to get back home, Tom, aren't
you? Will you let me take you in my car? Bless my spark plug, but
I'd like to have you along in case of another accident!"

The lad politely declined, however, and, with the valuable model and
papers safe on his motor-cycle, he started for Shopton. Arriving at
the first village after leaving the woods, Tom telephoned the good
news to his father, and that afternoon was safely at home, to the
delight of Mr. Swift and Mrs. Baggert.

The inventor lost no time in fully protecting his invention by
patents. As for the unprincipled men who made an effort to secure
it, they had so covered up their tracks that there was no way of
prosecuting them, nor could any action be held against Smeak &
Katch, the unscrupulous lawyers.

"Well," remarked Mr. Swift to Tom, a few nights after the recovery
of the model, "your motor-cycle certainly did us good service. Had
it not been for it I might never have gotten back my invention."

"Yes, it did come in handy," agreed the young inventor. "There's
that motor-boat, too. I wish I had it. I don't believe those fellows
will ever come back for it. I turned it over to the county
authorities, and they take charge of it for a while. I certainly had
some queer adventures since I got this machine from Mr. Damon,"
concluded Tom. I think my readers will agree with him.

CHAPTER I

A MOTOR-BOAT AUCTION


"Where are you going, Tom?" asked Mr. Barton Swift of his son as the
young man was slowly pushing his motor-cycle out of the yard toward the
country road.  "You look as though you had some object in view."

"So I have, dad.  I'm going over to Lanton."

"To Lanton?  What for?"

"I want to have a look at that motor-boat."

"Which boat is that, Tom? I don't recall your speaking about a boat
over at Lanton.  What do you want to look at it for?"

"It's the motor-boat those fellows had who tried to get away with your
turbine model invention, dad.  The one they used at the old General
Harkness mansion, in the woods near the lake, and the same boat that
fellow used when he got away from me the day I was chasing him here."

"Oh, yes, I remember now.  But what is the boat doing over at Lanton?"

"That's where it belongs.  It's the property of Mr. Bently Hastings.
The thieves stole it from him, and when they ran away from the old
mansion, the time Mr. Damon and I raided the place, they left the boat
on the lake.  I turned it over to the county authorities, and they
found out it belonged to Mr. Hastings.  He has it back now, but I
understand it's somewhat damaged, and he wants to get rid of it.  He's
going to sell it at auction to-day, and I thought I'd go over and take
a look at it.  You see--"

"Yes, I see, Tom," exclaimed Mr. Swift with a laugh.  "I see what
you're aiming at.  You want a motor-boat, and you're going all around
Robin Hood's barn to get at it."

"No, dad, I only--"

"Oh, I know you, Tom, my lad!" interrupted the inventor, shaking his
finger at his son, who seemed somewhat confused.  "You have a nice
rowing skiff and a sailboat, yet you are hankering for a motor-boat.
Come now, own up.  Aren't you?"

"Well, dad, a motor-boat certainly would go fine on Lake Carlopa.
There's plenty of room to speed her, and I wonder there aren't more of
them.  I was going to see what Mr. Hastings' boat would sell for, but I
didn't exactly think of buying it' Still--"

"But you wouldn't buy a damaged boat, would you?"

"It isn't much damaged," and in his eagerness the young inventor (for
Tom Swift had taken out several patents) stood his motor-cycle up
against the fence and came closer to his father.  "It's only slightly
damaged," he went on. "I can easily fix it.  I looked it all over
before I gave it in charge of the authorities, and it's certainly a
fine boat. It's worth nine hundred dollars--or it was when it was new."

"That's a good deal of money for a boat," and Mr. Swift looked serious,
for though he was well off, he was inclined to be conservative.

"Oh, I shouldn't think of paying that much.  In fact, dad, I really had
no idea of bidding at the auction.  I only thought I'd go over and get
an idea of what the boat might sell for.  Perhaps some day--"

Tom paused.  Since his father had begun to question him some new plans
had come into the lad's head.  He looked at his parent and saw a smile
beginning to work around the corners of Mr. Swift's lips.  There was
also a humorous look in the eyes of the older inventor.  He understood
boys fairly well, even if he only had one, and he knew Tom perfectly.

"Would you really like to make a bid on that boat Tom?" he asked.

"Would I, dad? Well--" The youth did not finish, but his father knew
what he meant.

"I suppose a motor-boat would be a nice thing to have on Lake Carlopa,"
went on Mr. Swift musingly.  "You and I could take frequent trips in
it.  It isn't like a motor-cycle, only useful for one.  What do you
suppose the boat will go for, Tom?"

"I hardly know.  Not a high price, I believe, for motor-boats are so
new on our lake that few persons will take a chance on them.  But if
Mr. Hastings is getting another, he will not be so particular about
insisting on a high price for the old one.  Then, too, the fact that it
is damaged will help to keep the price down, though I know I can easily
put it in good shape.  I would like to make a bid, if you think it's
all right."

"Well, I guess you may, Tom, if you really want it.  You have money of
your own and a motor-boat is not a bad investment.  What do you think
ought to be the limit?"

"Would you consider a hundred and fifty dollars too high?"

Mr. Swift looked at Tom critically.  He was plainly going over several
matters in his mind, and not the least of them was the pluck his son
had shown in getting back some valuable papers and a model from a gang
of thieves.  The lad certainly was entitled to some reward, and to
allow him to get a boat might properly be part of it.

"I think you could safely go as high as two hundred dollars, Tom," said
Mr. Swift at length.  "That would be my limit on a damaged boat for it
might be better to pay a little more and get a new one.  However, use
your own judgment, but don't go over two hundred.  So the thieves who
made so much trouble for me stole that boat from Mr. Hastings, eh?"

"Yes, and they didn't take much care of it either.  They damaged the
engine, but the hull is in good shape.  I'm ever so glad you'll let me
bid on it.  I'll start right off.  The auction is at ten o'clock and I
haven't more than time to get there."

"Now be careful how you bid.  Don't raise your own figures, as I've
sometimes seen women, and men too, do in their excitement.  Somebody
may go over your head; and if he does, let them.  If you get the boat
I'll be very glad on your account.  But don't bring any of Anson
Morse's gang back in it with you.  I've seen enough of them."

"I'll not dad!" cried Tom as he trundled his motor-cycle out of the
gate and into the country road that led to the village of Shopton,
where he lived, and to Lanton, where the auction was to be held.  The
young inventor had not gone far before he turned back, leaving his
machine standing on the side path.

"What's the matter?" asked his father, who had started toward one of
several machine shops on the premises--shops where Mr. Swift and his
son did inventive work.

"Guess I'd better get a blank check and some money," replied Tom as he
entered the house.  "I'll need to pay a deposit if I secure the boat."

"That's so.  Well, good luck," and with his mind busy on a plan for a
new kind of storage battery, the inventor went on to his workroom.  Tom
got some cash and his checkbook from a small safe he owned and was soon
speeding over the road to Lanton, his motor-cycle making quite a cloud
of dust.  While he is thus hurrying along to the auction I will tell
you something about him.

Tom Swift, son of Barton Swift, lived with his father and a motherly
housekeeper, Mrs. Baggert, in a large house on the outskirts of the
town of Shopton, in New York State.  Mr. Swift had acquired
considerable wealth from his many inventions and patents, but he did
not give up working out his ideas simply because he had plenty of
money.  Tom followed in the footsteps of his parent and had already
taken out several patents.

Shortly before this story opens the youth had become possessed of a
motor-cycle in a peculiar fashion.  As told in the first volume of this
series, entitled "Tom Swift and His Motor-cycle," Tom was riding to the
town of Mansburg on an errand for his father one day when he was nearly
run down by a motorcyclist.  A little later the same motorcyclist, who
was a Mr. Wakefield Damon, of Waterfield, collided with a tree near
Tom's home and was severely cut and bruised, the machine being broken.
Tom and his father cared for the injured rider, and Mr. Damon, who was
an eccentric individual, was so disheartened by his attempts to ride
the motor-cycle that he sold it to Tom for fifty dollars, though it had
cost much more.

About the same time that Tom bought the motor-cycle a firm of rascally
lawyers, Smeak & Katch by name, had, in conjunction with several men,
made an attempt to get control of an invention of a turbine motor
perfected by Mr. Swift.  The men, who were Ferguson Appleson, Anson
Morse, Wilson Featherton, alias Simpson, and Jake Burke, alias Happy
Harry, who sometimes disguised himself as a tramp, tried several times
to steal the model.

Their anxiety to get it was due to the fact that they had invested a
large sum in a turbine motor invented by another man, but their motor
would not work and they sought to steal Mr. Swift's.  Tom was sent to
Albany on his motor-cycle to deliver the model and some valuable papers
to Mr. Crawford, of the law firm of Reid & Crawford, of Washington,
attorneys for Mr. Swift.  Mr. Crawford had an errand in Albany and had
agreed to meet Tom there with the model.

But, on the way, Tom was attacked by the gang of unscrupulous men and
the model was stolen.  He was assaulted and carried far away in an
automobile.  In an attempt to capture the gang in a deserted mansion,
in the woods on the shore of Lake Carlopa, Tom was aided by Mr. Damon,
of whom he had purchased the motor-cycle.  The men escaped, however,
and nothing could be done to punish them.

Tom was thinking of the exciting scenes he had passed through about a
month previous as he spun along the road leading to Lanton.

"I hope I don't meet Happy Harry or any of his gang to-day," mused the
lad as he turned on a little more power to enable his machine to mount
a hill.  "I don't believe they'll attend the auction, though.  It would
be too risky for them."

As Tom swung along at a rapid pace he heard, behind him, the puffing of
an automobile, with the muffler cut out.  He turned and cast a hasty
glance behind.

"I hope that ain't Andy Foger or any of his cronies," he said to
himself.  "He might try to run me down just for spite.  He generally
rushes along with the muffler open so as to attract attention and make
folks think he has a racing car."

It was not Andy, however, as Tom saw a little later, as a man passed
him in a big touring car.  Andy Foger, as my readers will recollect,
was a red-haired, squinty-eyed lad with plenty of money and not much
else.  He and his cronies, including Sam Snedecker, nearly ran Tom down
one day, when the latter was on his bicycle, as told in the first
volume of this series.  Andy had been off on a tour with his chums
during the time when Tom was having such strenuous adventures and had
recently returned.

"If I can only get that boat," mused Tom as he swung back into the
middle of the road after the auto had passed him, "I certainly will
have lots of fun.  I'll make a week's tour of Lake Carlopa and take dad
and Ned Newton with me." Ned was Tom's most particular chum, but as
young Newton was employed in the Shopton bank, the lad did not have
much time for pleasure.  Lake Carlopa was a large body of water, and it
would take a moderately powered boat several days to make a complete
circuit of the shore, so cut up into bays and inlets was it.

In about an hour Tom was at Lanton, and as he neared the home of Mr.
Hastings, which was on the shore of the lake, he saw quite a throng
going down toward the boathouse.

"There'll be some lively bidding," thought Tom as he got off his
machine and pushed it ahead of him through the drive and down toward
the river.  "I hope they don't go above two hundred dollars, though."

"Get out the way there!" called a sudden voice, and looking back, Tom
saw that an automobile had crept up silently behind him.  In it were
Andy Foger and Sam Snedecker.  "Why don't you get out the way?"
petulantly demanded the red-haired lad.

"Because I don't choose to," replied Tom calmly, knowing that Andy
would never dare to speed up his machine on the slope leading down to
the lake.

"Go ahead, bump him!" the young inventor heard Sam whisper.

"You'd better try it, if you want to get the best trouncing you ever
had!" cried Tom hotly.

"Hu! I s'pose you think you're going to bid on the boat?" sneered Andy.

"Is there any law against it?" asked Tom.

"Hu! Well, you'll not get it.  I'm going to take that boat," retorted
the squint-eyed bully.  "Dad gave me the money to get it."

"All right," answered Tom non-committally.  "Go ahead.  It's a free
country."

He stood his motor-cycle up against a tree and went toward a group of
persons who were surrounding the auctioneer.  The time had arrived to
start the sale.  As Tom edged in closer he brushed against a man who
looked at him sharply.  The lad was just wondering if he had ever seen
the individual before, as there seemed to be something strangely
familiar about him, when the man turned quickly away, as if afraid of
being recognized.

"That's odd," thought Tom, but he had no further time for speculation,
as the auctioneer was mounting on a soapbox and had begun to address
the gathering.




CHAPTER II

SOME LIVELY BIDDING


"Attention, people!" cried the auctioneer.  "Give me your attention for
a few minutes, and we will proceed with the business in hand.  As you
all know, I am about to dispose of a fine motor-boat, the property of
Mr. Bently Hastings.  The reason for disposing of it at auction is
known to most of you, but for the benefit of those who do not, I will
briefly state them.  The boat was stolen by a gang of thieves and
recovered recently through the efforts of a young man, Thomas Swift,
son of Barton Swift, our fellow-townsman, of Shopton." At that moment
the auctioneer, Jacob Wood, caught sight of Tom in the press, and,
looking directly at the lad, continued:

"I understand that young Mr. Swift is here to-day, and I hope he
intends to bid on this boat.  If he does, the bidding will be lively,
for Tom Swift is a lively young man.  I wish I could say that some of
the men who stole the boat were here to-day."

The auctioneer paused and there were some murmurs from those in the
throng as to why such a wish should be uttered.  Tom felt some one
moving near him, and, looking around, he saw the same man with whom he
had come in contact before.  The person seemed desirous of getting out
on the edge of the crowd, and Tom felt a return of his vague
suspicions.  He looked closely at the fellow, but could trace no
resemblance to any of the men who had so daringly stolen his father's
model.

"The reason I wish they were here to-day," went on Mr. Wood, "is that
the men did some slight damage to the boat, and if they were here
to-day we would make them pay for it.  However, the damage is slight
and can easily be repaired.  I mention that, as Mr. Hastings desired me
to.  Now we will proceed with the bidding, and I will say that an
opportunity will first be given all to examine the boat.  Perhaps Tom
Swift will give us his opinion on the state it is in as we know he is
well qualified to talk about machinery."

All eyes were turned on Tom, for many knew him.

"Humph! I guess I know as much about boats and motors as he does,"
sneered Andy Foger.  "He isn't the only one in this crowd! Why didn't
the auctioneer ask me?"

"Keep quiet," begged Sam Snedecker.  "People are laughing at you, Andy."

"I don't care if they are," muttered the sandy haired youth.  "Tom
Swift needn't think he's everything."

"If you will come down to the dock," went on the auctioneer, "you can
all see the boat, and I would be glad to have young Mr. Swift give us
the benefit of his advice."

The throng trooped down to the lake, and, blushing somewhat, Tom told
what was the matter with the motor and how it could be fixed.  It was
noticed that there was less enthusiasm over the matter than there had
been, for certainly the engine, rusty and out of order as it was, did
not present an attractive sight.  Tom noted that the man, who had acted
so strangely, did not come down to the dock.

"Guess he can't be much interested in the motor," decided Tom.

"Now then, if it's all the same to you folks, I'll proceed with the
auction here," went on Mr. Wood.  "You can all see the boat from here.
It is, as you see, a regular family launch and will carry twelve
persons comfortably.  With a canopy fitted to it a person could cruise
all about the lake and stay out over night, for you could sleep on the
seat cushions.  It is twenty-one feet in length and has a
five-and-a-half-foot beam, the design being what is known as a
compromise stern.  The motor is a double-cylinder two-cycle one, of ten
horsepower.  It has a float-feed carburetor, mechanical oiler, and the
ignition system is the jump-spark--the best for this style of motor.
The boat will make ten miles an hour, with twelve in, and, of course,
more than that with a lighter load.  A good deal will depend on the way
the motor is managed.

"Now, as you know, Mr. Hastings wishes to dispose of the boat partly
because he does not wish to repair it and partly because he has a newer
and larger one.  The craft, which is named CARLOPA by the way, cost
originally nine hundred dollars.  It could not be purchased new to-day,
in many places, for a thousand.  Now what am I offered in its present
condition? Will any one make an offer?  Will you give me five hundred
dollars?"

The auctioneer paused and looked critically at the throng.  Several
persons smiled.  Tom looked worried.  He had no idea that the price
would start so high.

"Well, perhaps that is a bit stiff," went on Mr. Wood.  "Shall we say
four hundred dollars? Come now, I'm sure it's worth four hundred.
Who'll start it at four hundred?"

No one would, and the auctioneer descended to three hundred, then to
two and finally, as if impatient, he called out:

"Well, will any one start at fifty dollars?"

Instantly there were several cries of "I will!"

"I thought you would," went on the auctioneer.  "Now we will get down
to work.  I'm offered fifty dollars for this twenty-one foot, ten
horsepower family launch.  Will any one make it sixty?"

"Sixty!" called out Andy Foger in a shrill voice.  Several turned to
look at him.

"I didn't know he was going to bid," thought Tom.  "He may go above me.
He's got plenty of money, and, while I have too, I'm not going to pay
too much for a damaged boat."

"Sixty I'm bid, sixty--sixty!" cried Mr. Wood in a sing-song tone,
"who'll make it seventy?"

"Sixty-five!" spoke a quiet voice at Tom's elbow, and he turned to see
the mysterious man who had joined the crowd at the edge of the lake.

"Sixty-five from the gentleman in the white straw hat!" called Mr. Wood
with a smile at his wit, for there were many men wearing white straw
hats, the day being a warm one in June.

"Here, who's bidding above me?" exclaimed Andy, as if it was against
the law.

"I guess you'll find a number going ahead of you, my young friend,"
remarked the auctioneer.  "Will you have the goodness not to interrupt
me, except when you want to bid?"

"Well, I offered sixty," said the squint-eyed bully, while his crony,
Sam Snedecker, was vainly, pulling at his sleeve.

"I know you did, and this gentleman went above you.  If you want to bid
more you can do so.  I'm offered sixty-five, sixty-five I'm offered for
this boat.  Will any one make it seventy-five?"

Mr. Wood looked at Tom, and our hero, thinking it was time for him to
make a bid, offered seventy. "Seventy from Tom Swift!" cried the
auctioneer. "There is a lad who knows a motor-boat from stem to stern,
if those are the right words. I don't know much about boats except what
I'm told, but Tom Swift does. Now, if he bids, you people ought to know
that it's all right. I'm bid seventy--seventy I'm bid. Will any one
make it eighty?"

"Eighty!" exclaimed Andy Foger after a whispered conference with Sam.
"I know as much about boats as Tom Swift.  I'll make it eighty."

"No side remarks. I'll do most of the talking. You just bid, young
man," remarked Mr. Wood. "I have eighty bid for this boat--eighty
dollars. Why, my friends, I can't understand this.  I ought to have it
up to three hundred dollars, at least. But I thank you all the same. We
are coming on. I'm bid eighty--"

"Ninety!" exclaimed the quiet man at Tom's elbow.  He was continually
fingering his upper lip, as though he had a mustache there, but his
face was clean-shaven.  He looked around nervously as he spoke.

"Ninety!" called out the auctioneer.

"Ninety-five!" returned Tom.  Andy Foger scowled at him, but the young
inventor only smiled.  It was evident that the bully did not relish
being bid against.  He and his crony whispered together again.

"One hundred!" called Andy, as if no one would dare go above that.

"I'm offered an even hundred," resumed Mr. Wood.  "We are certainly
coming on.  A hundred I am bid, a hundred--a hundred--a hundred--"

"And five," said the strange man hastily, and he seemed to choke as he
uttered the words.

"Oh, come now; we ought to have at least ten-dollar bids from now on,"
suggested Mr. Wood.  "Won't you make it a hundred and ten?" The
auctioneer looked directly at the man, who seemed to shrink back into
the crowd.  He shook his head, cast a sort of despairing look at the
boat and hurried away.

"That's queer," murmured Tom.  "I guess that was his limit, yet if he
wanted the boat badly that wasn't a high price."

"Who's going ahead of me?" demanded Andy in loud tones.

"Keep quiet!" urged Sam.  "We may get it yet."

"Yes, don't make so many remarks," counseled the auctioneer.  "I'm bid
a hundred and five.  Will any one make it a hundred and twenty-five?"

Tom wondered why the man had not remained to see if his bid was
accepted, for no one raised it at once, but he hurried off and did not
look back.  Tom took a sudden resolve.

"A hundred and twenty-five!" he called out.

"That's what I like to hear," exclaimed Mr. Wood.  "Now we are doing
business.  A hundred and twenty-five from Tom Swift.  Will any one
offer me fifty?"

Andy and Sam seemed to be having some dispute.

"Let's make him quit right now," suggested Andy in a hoarse whisper.

"You can't," declared Sam'

"Yes, I can.  I'll go up to my limit right now."

"And some one will go above you---maybe Tom will," was Sam's retort.

"I don't believe he can afford to," Andy came back with.  "I'm going to
call his bluffs.  I believe he's only bidding to make others think he
wants it.  I don't believe he'll buy it."

Tom heard what was said, but did not reply.  The auctioneer was calling
monotonously: "I'm bid a hundred and twenty-five--twenty-five.  Will
any one make it fifty?"

"A hundred and fifty!" sang out Andy, and all eyes were directed toward
him.

"Sixty!" said Tom quietly.

"Here, you--" began the red-haired lad.  "You--"

"That will do!" exclaimed the auctioneer sternly.  "I am offered a
hundred and sixty.  Now who will give me an advance? I want to get the
boat up to two hundred, and then the real bidding will begin."

Tom's heart sank.  He hoped it would be some time before a two hundred
dollar offer would be heard.  As for Andy Foger, he was almost
speechless with rage.  He shook off the restraining arm of Sam, and,
worming his way to the front of the throng, exclaimed:

"I'll give a hundred and seventy-five dollars for that boat!"

"Good!" cried the auctioneer.  "That's the way to talk.  I'm offered a
hundred and seventy-five."

"Eighty," said Tom quietly, though his heart was beating fast.

"Well, of all--" began Andy, but Sam Snedecker dragged him back.

"You haven't got any more money," said the bully's crony.  "Better stop
now."

"I will not! I'm going home for more," declared Andy.  "I must have
that boat."

"It will be sold when you get back," said Sam.

"Haven't you got any money you can lend me?" inquired the squint-eyed
one, scowling in Tom's direction.  "No, not a bit.  There, some one
raised Tom's bid."

At that moment a man in the crowd offered a hundred and eighty-one
dollars.

"Small amounts thankfully received," said Mr. Wood with a laugh.  Then
the bidding became lively, a number making one-dollar advances.

The price got up to one hundred and ninety-five dollars and there it
hung for several minutes, despite the eloquence of Mr. Wood, who tried
by all his persuasive powers to get a substantial advance.  But every
one seemed afraid to bid.  As for the young inventor, he was in a
quandary.  He could only offer five dollars more, and, if he bid it in
a lump, some one might go to two hundred and five, and he would not get
the boat.  He wished he had secured permission from his father to go
higher, yet he knew that as a fair proposition two hundred dollars was
about all the motor-boat in its present condition was worth, at least
to him.  Then he made a sudden resolve.  He thought he might as well
have the suspense over.

"Two hundred dollars!" he called boldly.

"I'm offered two hundred!" repeated Mr. Wood.  "That is something like
it.  Now who will raise that?"

There was a moment of silence.  Then the auctioneer swung into an
enthusiastic description of the boat.  He begged for an advance, but
none was made, though Tom's heart seemed in his throat, so afraid was
he that he would not get the CARLOPA.

"Two hundred--two hundred!" droned on Mr. Wood. "I am offered two
hundred. Will any of you go any higher?" He paused a moment, and Tom's
heart beat harder than ever. "If not," resumed the speaker, "I will
declare the bidding closed. Are you all done?  Once--twice--three
times. Two hundred dollars. Going--going--gone!" He clapped his hands.
"The boat is sold to Thomas Swift for two hundred dollars. If he'll
step up I'll take his money."

There was a laugh as Tom, blushingly, advanced.  He passed Andy Foger,
who had worked his way over near him.

"You got the boat," sneered the bully, "and I s'pose you think you got
ahead of me."

"Keep quiet!" begged Sam.

"I won't!" exclaimed Andy.  "He outbid me just out of spite, and I'll
get even with him.  You see if I don't!"

Tom looked Andy Foger straight in the eyes, but did not answer, and the
red-haired youth turned aside, followed by his crony, and started
toward his automobile.

"I congratulate you on your bargain," said Mr. Wood as Tom proceeded to
make out a check.  He gave little thought to the threat Andy Foger had
made, but the time was coming when he was to remember it well.




CHAPTER III

A TIMELY WARNING


"Well, are you satisfied with your bargain, Tom?" asked Mr. Wood when
the formalities about transferring the ownership of the motor-boat had
been completed.

"Oh, yes, I calculated to pay just what I did."

"I'm glad you're satisfied, for Mr. Hastings told me to be sure the
purchaser was satisfied.  Here he comes now.  I guess he wasn't at the
auction."

An elderly gentleman was approaching Mr. Wood and Tom.  Most of the
throng was dispersing, but the young inventor noticed that Andy Foger
and Sam Snedecker stood to one side, regarding him closely.

"So you got my boat," remarked the former owner of the craft.  "I hope
you will be able to fix it up."

"Oh, I think I shall," answered the new owner of the CARLOPA.  "If I
can't, father will help me."

"Yes, you have an advantage there.  Are you going to keep the same
name?" and Mr. Hastings seemed quite interested in what answer the lad
would make.

"I think not," replied Tom.  "It's a good name, but I want something
that tells more what a fast boat it is, for I'm going to make some
changes that will increase the speed."

"That's a good idea. Call it the Swift."

"Folks would say I was stuck up if I did that," retorted the youth
quickly.  "I think I shall call it the ARROW.  That's a good, short
name, and--"

"It's certainly speedy," interrupted Mr. Hastings.  "Well now, since
you're not going to use the name CARLOPA, would you mind if I took it
for my new boat? I have a fancy for it."

"Not in the least," said Tom.  "Don't you want the letters from each
side of the bow to put on your new craft?"

"It's very kind of you to offer them, and, since you will have no need
for them, I'll be glad to take them off."

"Come down to my boat," invited Tom, using the word "my" with a proper
pride, "and I'll take off the brass letters.  I have a screw driver in
my motor-cycle tool bag."

As the former and present owners of the ARROW (which is the name by
which I shall hereafter designate Tom's motor-boat) walked down toward
the dock where it was moored the young inventor gave a startled cry.

"What's the matter?" asked Mr. Hastings.

"That man! See him at my motor-boat?" cried Tom.  He pointed to the
craft in the lake.  A man was in the cockpit and seemed to be doing
something to the forward bulkhead, which closed off the compartment
holding the gasoline tank.

"Who is he?" asked Mr. Hastings, while Tom started on a run toward the
boat.

"I don't know.  Some man who bid on the boat at the auction, but who
didn't go high enough," answered the lad.  As he neared the craft the
man sprang out, ran along the lakeshore for a short distance and then
disappeared amid the bushes which bordered the estate of Mr. Hastings.
Tom hurriedly entered the ARROW.

"Did he do any damage?" asked Mr. Hastings.

"I guess he didn't have time," responded Tom.  "But he was tampering
with the lock on the door of the forward compartment.  What's in there?"

"Nothing but the gasoline tank.  I keep the bulkhead sliding door
locked on general principles.  I can't imagine what the fellow would
want to open it for.  There's nothing of value in there.  Perhaps he
isn't right in his head.  Was he a tramp?"

"No, he was well dressed but he seemed very nervous during the auction,
as if he was disappointed not to have secured the boat.  Yet what could
he want in that compartment? Have you the key to the lock, Mr.
Hastings?"

"Yes, it belongs to you now, Mr. Swift," and the former owner handed it
to Tom, who quickly unlocked the compartment.  He slid back the door
and peered within, but all he saw was the big galvanized tank.

"Nothing in there he could want," commented the former owner of the
craft.

"No," agreed Tom in a low voice.  "I don't see what he wanted to open
the door for." But the time was to come, and not far off, when Tom was
to discover quite a mystery connected with the forward compartment of
his boat, and the solution of it was fated to bring him into no little
danger.

"It certainly is odd," went on Mr. Hastings when, after Tom had secured
the screw driver from his motor-cycle tool bag, he aided the lad in
removing the letters from the bow of the boat "Are you sure you don't
know the man?"

"No, I never saw him before.  At first I thought his voice sounded like
one of the members of the Happy Harry gang, but when I looked squarely
at him I could not see a bit of resemblance.  Besides, that gang would
not venture again into this neighborhood."

"No, I imagine not.  Perhaps he was only a curious, meddlesome person.
I have frequently been bothered by such individuals.  They want to see
all the working parts of an automobile or motor-boat, and they don't
care what damage they do by investigating."

Tom did not reply, but he was pretty certain that the man in question
had more of an object than mere curiosity in tampering with the boat.
However, he could discover no solution just then, and he proceeded with
the work of taking off the letters.

"What are you going to do with your boat, now that you have it?" asked
Mr. Hastings.  "Can you run it down to your dock in the condition in
which it is now?"

"No, I shall have to go back home, get some tools and fix up the motor.
It will take half a day, at least.  I will come back this afternoon
and, have the boat at my house by night.  That is if I may leave it at
your dock here."

"Certainly, as long as you like."

The young inventor had many things to think about as he rode toward
home, and though he was somewhat puzzled over the actions of the
stranger, he forgot about that in anticipating the pleasure he would
have when the motor-boat was in running order.

"I'll take dad off on a cruise about the lake," he decided.  "He needs
a rest, for he's been working hard and worrying over the theft of the
turbine motor model.  I'll take Ned Newton for some rides, too, and he
can bring his camera along and get a lot of pictures.  Oh, I'll have
some jolly sport this summer!"

Tom was riding swiftly along a quiet country road and was approaching a
steep hill, which he could not see until he was close to it, owing to a
sharp turn.

As he was about to swing around it and coast swiftly down the steep
declivity he was startled by hearing a voice calling to him from the
bushes at the side of the road.

"Hold on, dar! hold on, Mistah Swift!" cried a colored man, suddenly
popping into view.  "Doan't go down dat hill."

"Why, it's Eradicate Sampson!" exclaimed Tom, quickly shutting off the
power and applying the brakes.  "What's the matter, Rad? Why shouldn't
I go down that hill?"

"Beca'se, Mistah Swift, dere's a pow'ful monstrous tree trunk right
across de road at a place whar yo' cain't see it till yo' gits right on
top ob it.  Ef yo' done hit dat ar tree on yo' lickity-split machine,
yo' suah would land in kingdom come.  Doan't go down dat hill!"

Tom leaped off his machine and approached the colored man.  Eradicate
Sampson did odd jobs in the neighborhood of Shopton, and more than once
Tom had done him favors in repairing his lawn mower or his wood-sawing
machine.  In turn Eradicate had given Tom a valuable clue as to the
hiding place of the model thieves.

"How'd the log get across the road, Rad?" asked Tom.

"I dunno, Mistah Swift.  I see it when I come along wid mah mule,
Boomerang, an' I tried t' git it outer de way, but I couldn't.  Den I
left Boomerang an' mah wagon at de foot ob de hill an' I come up heah
t' git a long pole t' pry de log outer de way.  I didn't t'ink nobody
would come along, case dis road ain't much trabeled."

"I took it for a short cut," said the lad.  "Come on, let's take a look
at the log."

Leaving his machine at the top of the slope, the young inventor
accompanied the colored man 'down the hill.  At the foot of it, well
hidden from sight of any one who might come riding down, was a big log.
It was all the way across the road.

"That never fell there," exclaimed Tom in some excitement.  "That never
rolled off a load of logs, even if there had been one along, which
there wasn't.  That log was put there!"

"Does yo' t'ink dat, Mistah Swift?" asked Eradicate, his eyes getting
big.

"I certainly do, and, if you hadn't warned me, I might have been
killed."

"Oh, I heard yo' lickity-split machine chug-chuggin' along when I were
in de bushes, lookin' for a pryin' pole, an' I hurried out to warn yo.
I knowed I could leave Boomerang safe, 'case he's asleep."

"I'm glad you did warn me," went on the youth solemnly.  Then, as he
went closer to the log, he uttered an exclamation.

"That has been dragged here by an automobile!" he cried.  "It's been
done on purpose to injure some one.  Come on, Rad, let's see if we
can't find out who did it."

Something on the ground caught Tom's eye.  He stooped and picked up a
nickle-plated wrench.

"This may come in handy as evidence," he murmured.




CHAPTER IV

TOM AND ANDY CLASH


Even a casual observer could have told that an auto had had some part
in dragging the log to the place where it blockaded the road.  In the
dust were many marks of the big rubber tires and even the imprint of a
rope, which had been used to tow the tree trunk.

"What fo' yo' t'ink any one put dat log dere?" asked the colored man as
he followed Tom.  Boomerang, the mule, so called because Eradicate said
you never could tell what he was going to do, opened his eyes lazily
and closed them again.  "I don't know why, Rad, unless they wanted to
wreck an automobile or a wagon.  Maybe tramps did it for spite."

"Maybe some one done it to make yo' hab trouble, Mistah Swift."

"No, I hardly think so.  I don't know of any one who would want to make
trouble for me, and how would they know I was coming this way--"

Tom suddenly checked himself.  The memory of the scene at the auction
came back to him and he recalled what Andy Foger had said about
"'getting even."

"Which way did dat auto go?" resumed Eradicate.

"It came from down the road," answered Tom, not completing the sentence
he had left unfinished.  "They dragged the log up to the foot of the
hill and left it.  Then the auto went down this way." It was
comparatively easy, for a lad of such sharp observation as was Tom, to
trace the movements of the vehicle.

"Den if it's down heah, maybe we cotch 'em," suggested the colored man.

The young inventor did not answer at once.  He was hurrying along, his
eyes on the telltale marks.  He had proceeded some distance from the
place where the log was when he uttered a cry.  At the same moment he
hurried from the road toward a thick clump of bushes that were in the
ditch alongside of the highway.  Reaching them, he parted the leaves
and called:

"Here's the auto, Rad!"

The colored man ran up, his eyes wider open than ever.  There, hidden
amid the bushes, was a large touring car.

"Whose am dat?" asked Eradicate.

Tom did not answer.  He penetrated the underbrush, noting where the
broken branches had been bent upright after the forced entrance of the
car, the better to hide it.  The young inventor was, seeking some clew
to discover the owner of the machine.  To this end he climbed up in the
tonneau and was looking about when some one burst in through the screen
of bushes and a voice cried: "Here, you get out of my car!"

"Oh, is it your car, Andy Foger?" asked Tom calmly as he recognized his
squint-eyed rival.  "I was just beginning to think it was.  Allow me to
return your wrench," and he held out the one he had picked up near the
log.  "The next time you drag trees across the road," went on the lad
in the tonneau, facing the angry and dismayed Andy, "I'd advise you to
post a notice at the top of the hill, so persons riding down will not
be injured."

"Notice--road--hill--logs!" stammered Andy, turning red under his
freckles.

"That's what I said," replied Tom coolly.

"I--I didn't have anything to do with putting a log across any road,"
mumbled the bully.  "I--I've been off toward the creek."

"Have you?" asked Tom with a peculiar smile.

"I thought you might have been looking for the wrench you dropped near
the log.  You should be more careful and so should Sam Snedecker, who's
hiding outside the bushes," went on our hero, for he had caught sight
of the form of Andy's crony.  "I--I told him not to do it!" exclaimed
Sam as he came from his hiding place.

"Shut up!" exclaimed Andy desperately.

"Oh, I think I know your secret," continued the young inventor.  "You
wanted to get even with me for outbidding you on the motor-boat.  You
watched which road I took, and then, in your auto, you came a shorter
way, ahead of me.  You hauled the log across the foot of the hill,
hoping, I suppose, that my machine would be broken.  But, let me tell
you, it was a risky trick.  Not only might I have been killed, but so
would whoever else who happened to drive down the slope over the log,
whether in a wagon or automobile.  Fortunately Eradicate discovered it
in time and warned me.  I ought to have you arrested, but you're not
worth it.  A good thrashing is what such sneaks as you deserve!"

"You haven't got any evidence against us," sneered Andy confidently,
his old bravado coming back.

"I have all I want," replied Tom.  "You needn't worry.  I'm not going
to tell the police.  But you've got to do one thing or I'll make you
sorry you ever tried this trick.  Eradicate will help me, so don't
think you're going to escape."

"You get out of my automobile!" demanded Andy.  "I'll have you arrested
if you don't."

"I'll get out because I'm ready to, but not on account of your
threats," retorted Mr. Swift's son.  "Here's your wrench.  Now I want
you and Sam to start up this machine and haul that log out of the way."

"S'pose I won't do it?" snapped Andy.

"Then I'll cause your arrest, besides thrashing you into the bargain!
You can take your choice of removing the log so travelers can pass or
having a good hiding, you and Sam.  Eradicate, you take Sam and I'll
tackle Andy."

"Don't you dare touch me!" cried the bully, but there was a whine in
his tones.

"You let me alone or I'll tell my father!" added Sam.  "I--I didn't
have nothin' to do with it, anyhow.  I told Andy it would make trouble,
but he made me help him."

"Say, what's the matter with you?" demanded Andy indignantly of his
crony.  "Do you want to--"

"I wish I'd never come with you," went on Sam, who was beginning to be
frightened.

"Come now.  Start up that machine and haul the log out of the way,"
demanded Tom again.

"I won't do it!" retorted the red-haired lad impudently.

"Yes, you will," insisted our hero, and he took a step toward the
bully.  They were out of the clump of bushes now and in the roadside
ditch.  "You let me alone," almost screamed Andy, and in his baffled
rage he rushed at Tom, aiming a blow.

The young inventor quickly stepped to one side, and, as the bully
passed him, Tom sent out a neat left-hander.  Andy Foger went down in a
heap on the grass.




CHAPTER V

A TEST OF SPEED


Whether Tom or Andy was the most surprised at the happening would be
hard to say.  The former had not meant to hit so hard and he certainly
did not intend to knock the squint-eyed youth down.  The latter's fall
was due, as much as anything, to his senseless, rushing tactics and to
the fact that he slipped on the green grass.  The bully was up in a
moment, however, but he knew better than to try conclusions with Tom
again.  Instead he stood out of reach and spluttered:

"You just wait, Tom Swift! You just wait!"

"Well, I'm waiting," responded the other calmly.

"I'll get even with you," went on Andy.  "You think you're smart
because you got ahead of me, but I'll get square!"

"Look here!" burst out the young inventor determinedly, taking a step
toward his antagonist, at which Andy quickly retreated, "I don't want
any more of that talk from you, Andy Foger.  That's twice you've made
threats against me to-day.  You put that log across the road, and if
you try anything like it for your second attempt I'll make you wish you
hadn't.  That applies to you, too, Sam," he added, glancing at the
other lad.

"I--I ain't gone' to do nothin'," declared Sam.

"I told Andy not to put that tree--"

"Keep still, can't you!" shouted the bully.  "Come on.  We'll get even
with him, that's all," he muttered as he went back into the bushes
where the auto was.  Andy cranked up and he and his crony getting into
the car were about to start off.

"Hold on!" cried Tom.  "You'll take that log from across the road or
I'll have you arrested for obstructing traffic, and that's a serious
offense."

"I'm goin' to take it away!" growled Andy.  "Give a fellow a show can't
you?"

He cast an ugly look at Tom, but the latter only smiled.  It was no
easy task for Sam and Andy to pull the log out of the way, as they
could hardly lift it to slip the rope under.  But they finally managed
it, and, by the power of the car, hauled it to one side.  Then they
speed off.

"I 'clar t' gracious, dem young fellers am most as mean an' contrary as
mah mule Boomerang am sometimes," observed Eradicate.  "Only Boomerang
ain't quite so mean as dat."

"I should hope not, Rad," observed Tom.  "I'm ever so much obliged for
your warning.  I guess I'll be getting, home now.  Come around next
week; we have some work for you."

"'Deed an' I will," replied the colored man.  "I'll come around an'
eradicate all de dirt on yo' place, Mistah Swift.  Yais, sah, I's
Eradicate by name, and dat's my perfession--eradicatin' dirt.  Much
obleeged, I'll call around.  Giddap, Boomerang!"

The mule lazily flicked his ears, but did not stir, and Tom, knowing
the process of arousing the animal would take some time, hurried up the
hill to where he had left his motor-cycle.  Eradicate was still engaged
on the task of trying to arouse his steed to a sense of its duty when
the young inventor flashed by on his way home.

"So now you own a broken motor-boat," observed Mr. Swift when Tom had
related the circumstances of the auction.  "Well, now you have it, what
are you going to do with it?"

"Fix it, first of all," replied his son.  "It needs considerable
tinkering up, but nothing but what I can do, if you'll help me."

"Of course I will.  Do you think you can get any speed out of it?"

"Well, I'm not so anxious for speed.  I want a good, comfortable boat,
and the ARROW will be that.  I've named it, you see.  I'm going back to
Lanton this afternoon, take some tools along, and repair it so I can
run the boat over to here.  Then I'll get at it and fix it up.  I've
got a plan for you, dad."

"What is it?" asked the inventor, his rather tired face lighting up
with interest.

"I'm going to take you on a vacation trip."

"A vacation trip?"

"Yes, you need a rest.  You've been working too hard over that
gyroscope invention."

"Yes, Tom, I think I have," admitted Mr. Swift.  "But I am very much
interested in it, and I think I can get it to work.  If I do it will
make a great difference in the control of aeroplanes.  It will make
them more stable and able to fly in almost any wind.  But I certainly have
puzzled my brains over some features of it.  However, I don't quite see
what you mean."

"You need a rest, dad," said Mr. Swift's son kindly.  "I want you to
forget all about patents, invention, machinery and even the gyroscope
for a week or two.  When I get my motor-boat in shape I'm going to take
you and Ned Newton up the lake for a cruise.  We can camp out, or, if
we had to, we could sleep in the boat.  I'm going to put a canopy on it
and arrange some bunks.  It will do you good and perhaps new ideas for
your gyroscope may come to you after a rest."

"Perhaps they will, Tom.  I am certainly tired enough to need a
vacation.  It's very kind of you to think of me in connection with your
boat.  But if you're going to get it this afternoon you'd better start
if you expect to get back by night.  I think Mrs. Baggert has dinner
ready."

After the meal Tom selected a number of tools from his own particular
machine shop and carried them down to the dock on the lake, where his
two small boats were tied.

"Aren't you going back on your motor-cycle?" asked his father.

"No, Dad, I'm going to row over to Lanton, and, if I can get the ARROW
fixed, I'll tow my rowboat back."

"Very well, then you won't be in any danger from Andy Foger.  I must
speak to his father about him."

"No, dad, don't," exclaimed the young inventor quickly.  "I can fight
my own battles with Andy.  I don't fancy he will bother me again right
away."

Tom found it more of a task than he had anticipated to get the motor in
shape to run the ARROW back under her own power.  The magneto was out
of order and the batteries needed renewing, while the spark coil had
short-circuited and took considerable time to adjust.  But by using
some new dry cells, which Mr. Hastings gave him, and cutting out the
magneto, or small dynamo which produces the spark that exploded the
gasoline in the cylinders, Tom soon had a fine, "fat" hot spark from
the auxiliary ignition system.  Then, adjusting the timer and throttle
on the engine and seeing that the gasoline tank was filled, the lad
started up his motor.  Mr. Hastings helped him, but after a few turns
of the flywheel there were no explosions.  Finally, after the
carburetor (which is the device where gasoline is mixed with air to
produce an explosive mixture) had been adjusted, the motor started off
as if it had intended to do so all the while and was only taking its
time about it.

"The machine doesn't run as smooth as it ought to," commented Mr.
Hastings.  "No, it needs a thorough overhauling," agreed the owner of
the ARROW.  "I'll get at it to-morrow," and with that he swung out into
the lake, towing his rowboat after him.

"A motor-boat of my own!" exulted Tom as he twirled the steering wheel
and noted how readily the craft answered her helm.  "This is great!"

He steered down the lake and then, turning around, went up it a mile or
more before heading for his own dock, as he wanted to see how the
engine behaved.

"With some changes and adjustments I can make this a speedy boat,"
thought Tom.  "I'll get right at it.  I shouldn't wonder if I could
make a good showing against Mr. Hastings' new CARLOPA, though his
boat's got four cylinders and mine has but two."

The lad was proceeding leisurely along the lakeshore, near his home,
with the motor throttled down to test it at low speed, when he heard
some one shout.  Looking toward the bank, Tom saw a man waving his
hands.

"I wonder what he wants?" thought our hero as he put the wheel over to
send his craft to shore.  He heard a moment later, for the man on the
bank cried:

"I say, my young friend, do you know anything about automobiles?  Of
course you do or you wouldn't be running a motor-boat.  Bless my very
existence, but I'm in trouble!  My machine has stopped on a lonely road
and I can't seem to get it started.  I happened to hear your boat and I
came here to hail you.  Bless my coat-pockets but I am in trouble!  Can
you help me?  Bless my soul and gizzard!"

"Mr. Damon!" exclaimed Tom, shutting off the power, for he was now near
shore.  "Of course I'll help you, Mr. Damon," for the young inventor
had recognized the eccentric man of whom he had purchased the
motor-cycle and who had helped him in rounding up the thieves.

"Why, bless my shoe-laces, if it isn't Tom Swift!" exclaimed Mr. Damon,
who seemed very fond of calling down blessings upon himself or upon
articles of his dress or person.

"Yes! I'm here," admitted Tom with a laugh.

"And in a motor-boat, too! Bless my pocketbook, but did that run away
with some one who sold it to you cheap?"

"No, not exactly," and the lad explained how he had come into
possession of it.  By this time he was ashore and had tied the ARROW to
an overhanging tree.  Then Tom proceeded to where Mr. Damon had left
his stalled automobile.  The eccentric man was wealthy and his
physician had instructed him to ride about in the car for his health.
Tom soon located the trouble.  The carburetor had become clogged, and
it was soon in working order again.

"Well, now that you have a boat, I don't suppose you will be riding
about the country so much," commented Mr. Damon as he got into his car.
"Bless my spark-plug! But if you ever get over to Waterfield, where I
live, come and see me.  It's handy to get to by water."

"I'll come some day," promised the lad.

"Bless my hat band, but I hope so," went on the eccentric individual as
he prepared to start his car.

Tom completed the remainder of the trip to his house without incident
and his father came down to the dock to see the motor-boat.  He agreed
with his son that it was a bargain and that it could easily be put in
fine shape.

The youth spent all the next day and part of the following working on
the craft.  He overhauled the ignition system, which was the jump-spark
style, cleaned the magneto and adjusted the gasoline and compression
taps so that they fitted better.  Then he readjusted the rudder lines,
tightening them on the steering wheel, and looked over the piping from
the gasoline tank.

The tank was in the forward compartment, and, upon inspecting this, the
lad concluded to change the plan by which the big galvanized iron box
was held in place.  He took out the old wooden braces and set them
closer together, putting in a few new ones.

"The tank will not vibrate so when I'm going at full speed," he
explained to his father.

"Is that where the strange man was tampering with the lock the day of
the auction?" asked Mr. Swift.

"Yes, but I don't see what he could want in this compartment, do you
dad?"

The inventor got into the boat and looked carefully into the rather
dark space where the tank fitted.  He went over every inch of it, and,
pointing to one of the thick wooden blocks that supported the tank,
asked:

"Did you bore that hole in there, Tom?"

"No, it was there before I touched the braces.  But it isn't a hole, or
rather, someone bored it and stopped it up again.  It doesn't weaken
the brace any."

"No, I suppose not.  I was just wondering whether that was one of the
new blocks or an old one."

"Oh, an old one.  I'm going to paint them, too, so in case the water
leaks in or the gasoline leaks out the wood won't be affected.  A
gasoline tank should vibrate as little as possible, if you don't want
it to leak.  I guess I'll paint the whole interior of this compartment
white, then I can see away into the far corners of it."

"I think that's a good idea," commented Mr. Swift.

It was four days after his purchase of the boat before Tom was ready to
make a long trip in it.  Up to that time he had gone on short spins not
far from the dock, in order to test the engine adjustment.  The lad
found it was working very well, but he decided with a new kind of spark
plugs for the two cylinders that he could get more speed out of it.
Finally the forward compartment was painted and a general overhauling
given the hull and Tom was ready to put his boat to a good test.

"Come on, Ned," he said to his chum early one evening after Mr. Swift
had said he was too tired to go out on a trial run.  "We'll see what
the ARROW will do now."

From the time Tom started up the motor it was evident that the boat was
going through the water at a rapid rate.  For a mile or more the two
lads speeded along, enjoying it hugely.  Then Ned exclaimed:

"Something's coming behind us."

Tom turned his head and looked.  Then he called out:

"It's Mr. Hastings in his new CARLOPA.  I wonder if he wants a race?"

"Guess he'd have it all his own way," suggested Ned.

"Oh, I don't know.  I can get a little more speed out of my boat."

Tom waited until the former owner of the ARROW was up to him.

"Want a race?" asked Mr. Hastings good-naturedly.

"Sure!" agreed Tom, and he shoved the timer ahead to produce quicker
explosions.

The ARROW seemed to leap forward and for a moment was ahead of the
CARLOPA, but with a motion of his hand to the spark lever Mr. Hastings
also increased his speed.  For a moment the two boats were on even
terms and then the larger and newer one forged ahead.  Tom had expected
it, but he was a little disappointed.

"That's doing first rate," complimented Mr. Hastings as he passed them.
"Better than I was ever able to make her do even when she was new, Tom."

This made the present owner of the ARROW feel somewhat consoled.  He
and Ned ran on for a few miles, the CARLOPA in the meanwhile
disappearing from view around a bend.  Then Tom and his chum turned
around and made for the Swift dock.

"She certainly is a dandy!" declared Ned.  "I wish I had one like it."

"Oh, I intend that you shall have plenty of rides in this," went on his
friend.  "When you get your vacation, you and dad and I are going on a
tour," and he explained his plan, which, it is needless to say, met
with Ned's hearty approval.

Just before going to bed, some hours later, Tom decided to go down to
the dock to make sure he had shut off the gasoline cock leading from
the tank of his boat to the motor.  It was a calm, early summer night,
with a new moon giving a little light, and the lad went down to the
lake in his slippers.  As he neared the boathouse he heard a noise.

"Water rat," he murmured, "or maybe muskrats.  I must set some traps."

As Tom entered the boathouse he started back in alarm, for a bright
light flashed up, almost in his eyes.

"Who's here?" he cried, and at that moment someone sprang out of his
motor-boat, scrambled into a rowing craft which the youth could dimly
make out in front of the dock and began to pull away quickly.

"Hold on there!" cried the young inventor. "Who are you?  What do you
want?  Come back here!"

The person in the 'coat returned no answer.  With his heart doing beats
over-time Tom lighted a lantern and made a hasty examination of the
ARROW.  It did not appear to have been harmed, but a glance showed that
the door of the gasoline compartment had been unlocked and was open.
Tom jumped down into his craft.

"Some one has been at that compartment again!" he murmured.  "I wonder
if it was the same man who acted so suspiciously at the auction?  What
can his object be, anyhow?"

The next moment he uttered an exclamation of startled surprise and
picked up something from the bottom of the boat.  It was a bunch of
keys, with a tag attached, bearing the owner's name.

"Andy Foger!" murmured Tom.  "So this is, how he was trying to get
even!  Maybe he started to put a hole in the tank or in my boat."




CHAPTER VI

TOWING SOME GIRLS


With a sense of anger mingled with an apprehension lest some harm
should have been done to his craft, the owner of the ARROW went
carefully over it.  He could find nothing wrong.  The engine was all
right and all that appeared to have been accomplished by the unbidden
visitor was the opening of the locked forward compartment.  That this
had been done by one of the many keys on Andy Foger's ring was evident.

"Now what could have been his object?" mused Tom.  "I should think if
he wanted to put a hole in the boat he would have done it amidships,
where the water would have a better chance to come in, or perhaps he
wanted to flood it with gasoline and--"

The idea of fire was in Tom's mind, and he did not finish his
half-completed thought.

"That may have been it," he resumed after a hasty examination of the
gasoline tank, to make sure there were no leaks in it.  "To get even
with me for outbidding him on the boat, Andy may have wanted to destroy
the ARROW.  Well, of all the mean tricks, that's about the limit!  But
wait until I see him.  I've got evidence against him," and Tom looked
at the key ring.  "I could almost have him arrested for this."

Going outside the boathouse, Tom stood on the edge of the dock and
peered into the darkness.  He could hear the faint sound of someone
rowing across the lake, but there was no light.

"He had one of those electric flash lanterns," decided Tom.  "If I
hadn't found his keys, I might have thought it was Happy Harry instead
of Andy."

The young inventor went back into the house after carefully locking the
boat compartment and detaching from the engine an electrical device,
without which the motor in the ARROW could not be started.

"That will prevent them from running away with my boat, anyhow,"
decided Tom.  "And I'll tell Garret Jackson to keep a sharp watch
to-night." Jackson was the engineer at Mr. Swift's workshop.

Tom told his father of the happening and Mr. Swift was properly
indignant.  He wanted to go at once to see Mr. Foger and complain of
Andy's act, but Tom counseled waiting.

"I'll attend to Andy myself," said the young inventor.  "He's getting
desperate, I guess, or he wouldn't try to set the place on fire.  But
wait until I show him these keys."

Bright and early the next morning the owner of the motor-boat was down
to the dock inspecting it.  The engineer, who had been on watch part of
the night, reported that there had been no disturbance, and Tom found
everything all right.  "I wonder if I'd better go over and accuse Andy
now or wait until I see him and spring this evidence on him?" thought
our hero.  Then he decided it would be better to wait.  He took the
ARROW out after breakfast, his father going on a short spin with him.

"But I must go back now and work on my gyroscope invention," said Mr.
Swift when about two hours had been spent on the lake.  "I am making
good progress with it."

"You need a vacation," decided Tom, "I'll be ready to take you and Ned
in about two weeks.  He will have two weeks off then and, we'll have
some glorious times together."

That afternoon Tom put some new style spark plugs in the cylinders of
his motor and found that he had considerably increased the revolutions
of the engine, due to a better explosion being obtained.  He also made
some minor adjustments and the next day he went out alone for a long
run.

Heading up the lake, Tom was soon in sight of a popular excursion
resort that was frequently visited by church and Sunday-school
organizations in the vicinity of Shopton.  The lad saw a number of
rowing craft and a small motor-boat circling around opposite the resort
and remarked: "There must be a picnic at the grove to-day.  Guess I'll
run up and take a look."

The lad was soon in the midst of quite a flotilla of rowboats, most of
them manned by pretty girls or in charge of boys who were giving
sisters (their own or some other chap's) a trip on the water.  Tom
throttled his boat down to slow speed and looked with pleasure on the
pretty scene.  His boat attracted considerable attention, for motor
craft were not numerous on Lake Carlopa.

As our hero passed a boat, containing three very pretty young ladies,
Tom heard one of them exclaim:

"There he is now!  That's Tom Swift."

Something in the tones of the voice attracted his attention.  He turned
and saw a brown-eyed girl smiling at him.  She bowed and asked,
blushing the while:

"Well, have you caught any more runaway horses lately?"

"Runaway horses--why--what?  Oh, it's Miss Nestor!" exclaimed the lad,
recognizing the young lady whose steed he had frightened one day when
he was on his bicycle.  As told in the first volume of this series, the
horse had run away, being alarmed at the flashing of Tom's wheel, and
Miss Mary Nestor, of Mansburg, was in grave danger.

"So you've given up the bicycle for the motor-boat," went on the young
lady.

"Yes," replied Tom with a smile, shutting off the power, "and I haven't
had a chance to save any girls since I've had it."

The two boats had drifted close together, and Miss Nestor introduced
her two companions to Tom.

"Don't you want to come in and take a ride?" he asked.

"Is it safe?" asked Jennie Haddon, one of the trio.

"Of course it is, Jennie, or he wouldn't be out in it," said Miss
Nestor hastily.  "Come on, let's get in.  I'm just dying for a
motor-boat ride."

"What will we do with our boat?" asked Katie Carson.

"Oh, I can tow that," replied the youth.  "Get right in and I'll take
you all around the lake."

"Not too far," stipulated the girl who had figured in the runaway.  "We
must be back for lunch, which will be served in about an hour.  Our
church and Sunday-school are having a picnic."

"Maybe Mr. Swift will come and have some lunch with us," suggested Miss
Carson, blushing prettily.

"Nothing would give me greater pleasure," answered Tom, and then he
laughed at his formal reply, the girls joining in.

"We'd be glad to have you," added Miss Haddon.  "Oh!" she suddenly
screamed, "the boat's tipping over!"

"Oh, no," Tom hastened to assure her, coming, to the side to help her
in.  "It just tilts a bit, with the weight of so many on one side.  It
couldn't capsize if it tried."

In another moment the three were in the roomy cockpit and Tom had made
the empty rowboat fast to the stern.  He was about to start up when
from another boat, containing two little girls and two slightly larger
boys, came a plaintive cry:

"Oh, mister, give us a ride!"

"Sure!" agreed Tom pleasantly.  "Just fasten your boat to the other
rowboat and I'll tow you."

One of the boys did this, and then, with three pretty girls as his
companions in the ARROW and towing the two boats, Tom started off.

The girls were very much interested in the craft and asked all sorts of
questions about how the engine operated.  Tom explained as clearly as
he could how the gasoline exploded in the cylinders, about the electric
spark and about the propeller.  Then, when he had finished, Miss Haddon
remarked naively:

"Oh, Mr. Swift, you've explained it beautifully, and I'm sure if our
teacher in school made things as clear as you have that I could get
along fine.  I understand all about it, except I don't see what makes
the engine go."

"Oh," said Tom faintly, and he wondering what would be the best remark
to make under the circumstances, when Miss Nestor created a diversion
by looking at her watch and exclaiming:

"Oh, girls, it's lunch time!  We must go ashore.  Will you kindly put
about, Mr. Swift--I hope that is the proper term--and--land us--is that
right?" and she looked archly at Tom.

"That's perfectly right," he admitted with a laugh and a glance into
the girl's brown eyes.  "I'll put you ashore at once," and he headed
for a small dock.

"And come yourself to take lunch with us, added Miss Haddon.

"I'm afraid I might be in the way," stammered Tom.  "I--I have a pretty
good appetite, and--"

"I suppose you think that girls on a picnic don't take much lunch,"
finished Miss Nestor.  "But I assure you that we have plenty, and that
you will be very welcome," she added warmly.

"Yes, and I'd like to have him explain over again how the engine
works," went on Miss Haddon.  "I am so interested."

Tom helped the girls out, receiving their thanks as well as those of
the children in the second boat.  But as he walked with the young
ladies through the grove the young inventor registered a mental vow
that he would steer clear of explaining again how a gasoline engine
worked.

"Now come right over this way to our table," invited Miss Nestor.  "I
want you to meet papa and mamma."

Tom followed her.  As he stepped from behind a clump of trees he saw,
standing not far away, a figure that seemed strangely familiar.  A
moment later the figure turned and Tom saw Andy Foger confronting him.
At the sight of our hero the bully turned red and walked quickly away,
while Tom's fingers touched the ring of keys in his pocket.




CHAPTER VII

A BRUSH WITH ANDY


So unexpected was his encounter with Andy that the young inventor
hardly knew how to act, especially since he was a guest of the young
ladies.  Tom did not want to do or say anything to embarrass them or
make a scene, yet he did want to have a talk, and a very serious talk,
with Andy Foger.

Miss Nestor must have noticed Tom's sudden start at his glimpse of
Andy, for she asked: "Did you see some one you knew, Mr. Swift?"

"Yes," replied Tom, "I did--er--that is--" He paused in some confusion.

"Perhaps you'd like---that is prefer--to go with them instead of taking
lunch with girls who don't know anything about engines?" she persisted.

"Oh, no indeed," Tom hastened to assure her.  "He--that is--the person
I saw wouldn't care to have me lunch with him," and the youth smiled
grimly.

"Would you like to bring him over to our table?" inquired Miss Carson.
"We have plenty for him."

"No, I think that would hardly do," continued the lad, who tried not to
smile at the picture of the red-haired and squint-eyed Andy Foger
making one of a party with the girls.  The young ladies fortunately had
not noticed the bully, who was out of view by this time.

Tom was presented to Mr. and Mrs. Nestor, who told him how glad they
were to meet the young man who had been instrumental in saving their
daughter from injury, if not death.  Tom was a bit embarrassed, but
bore the praise as well as he could, and he was very glad when a
diversion, in the shape of lunch, occurred.

After a meal on tables under the trees in the grove Tom took the girls
and some of their friends out in his motor-boat again.  They covered
several miles around the lake before returning to the picnic ground.

As Tom was starting toward home in his boat, wondering what had become
of Andy and trying to think of a reason why the bully should attend
anything as "tame" as a church picnic, the object of his thoughts came
strolling through the trees down to the shore of the lake.  The moment
he saw Tom the red-haired lad started back, but the young inventor,
leaping out of his boat, called out:

"Hold on there, Andy Foger, I want to see you!" and there was menace in
Tom's tone.

"But, I don't want to see you!" retorted the other sulkily.  "I've got
no use for you."

"No more have I for you," was Tom's quick reply.  "But I want to return
you these keys.  You dropped them in my boat the other night when you
tried to set it afire.  If I ever catch you--"

"My keys!  Your boat!  On fire!" gasped Andy, so plainly astonished
that Tom knew his surprise was genuine.

"Yes, your keys.  You were a little too quick for me or I'd have
caught you at it.  The next time you pick a lock don't leave your keys
behind you," and he held out the jingling ring.

Andy Foger advanced slowly.  He took the bunch of keys and looked at
the tag.

"They are mine," he said slowly, as if there was some doubt about it.

"Of course they are," declared Tom.  "I found them where you dropped
them--in my boat."

"Do you mean over at the auction?"

"No, I mean down in my boathouse, where you sneaked in the other night
and tried to do some damage.

"The other night!" cried Andy.  "I never was near your boathouse any
night and I never lost my keys there!  I lost these the day of the
auction, on Mr. Hastings' ground, and I've been looking for them ever
since."

"Didn't you sneak in my boathouse the other night and try to do some
mischief?  Didn't you drop them then?"

"No, I didn't," retorted Andy earnestly.  "I lost those keys at the
auction, and I can prove it to you.  Look, I advertised for them in the
weekly Gazette."

The red-haired lad pulled a crumpled paper from his pocket and showed
Tom an advertisement offering a reward of two dollars for a bunch of
keys on a ring, supposed to have been lost at the auction on Mr.
Hastings' grounds in Lanton.  The finder was to return them to Andy
Foger.

"Does that look as if I lost the keys in your boathouse?" demanded the
bully sneeringly.  "I wouldn't have advertised them that way if I'd been
trying to keep my visit quiet.  Besides, I can prove that I was out of
town several nights.  I was over to an entertainment in Mansburg one
night and I didn't get home until two o'clock in the morning, because
my machine broke down.  Ask Ned Newton.  He saw me at the
entertainment."

Andy's manner was so earnest that Tom could not help believing him.
Then there was the evidence of the advertisement.  Clearly the
squint-eyed youth had not been the mysterious visitor to the boathouse
and had not unlocked the forward compartment.  But if it was not he,
who could it have been and how did the keys get there?  These were
questions which racked Tom's brain.

"You can ask Ned Newton," repeated Andy.  "He'll prove that I couldn't
have been near your place, if you don't believe me."

"Oh, I believe you all right," answered Tom, for there could be no
doubting Andy's manner, even though he and the young inventor were not
on good terms.  "But how did your keys get in my boat?"

"I don't know, unless you found them, kept them and dropped them
there," was the insolent answer.

"You know better than that," exclaimed Tom.

"Well, I owe you a reward of two dollars for giving them back to me,"
continued the bully patronizingly.  "Here it is," and he hauled out
some bills.

"I don't want your money!" fired back Tom.

"But I'd like to know who it was that was in my boat."

"And I'd like to know who it was took my keys," and Andy stuffed the
money back in his pocket.  Tom did not answer.  He was puzzling over a
queer matter and he wanted to be alone and think.  He turned aside from
the red-haired lad and walked toward his motor-boat.

"I'll give you a surprise in a few days," Andy called after him, but
Tom did not turn his head nor did he inquire what the surprise might be.

Mr. Swift was somewhat puzzled when his son related the outcome of the
key incident.  He agreed with Tom that some one might have found the
ring and kept it, and that the same person might have been the one whom
Tom had surprised in the boathouse.

"But it's idle to speculate on it," commented the inventor.  "Andy
might have induced some of his chums to act for him in harming your
boat, and the key advertisement might have been only a ruse."

"I hardly think so," answered his son, shaking his head.  "It strikes
me as being very curious, and I'm going to see if I can't get at the
bottom of it."

But a week or more passed and Tom had no clew.  In the meanwhile he was
working away at his motor-boat, installing several improvements.

One of these was a better pump, which circulated the water around the
cylinders, and another was a new system of lubrication under forced
feed.

"This ought to give me a little more speed," reasoned Tom, who was not
yet satisfied with his craft.  "Guess I'll take it out for a spin."

He was alone in the ARROW, taking a long course up the lake when, as he
passed a wooded point that concealed from view a sort of bay, he heard
the puffing of another motor-boat.

"Maybe that's Mr. Hastings," thought Tom.  "If I raced with him now, I
think the ARROW could give a better account of herself."

The young inventor looked at the boat as it came into view.  It needed
but a glance to show that it was not the CARLOPA.  Then, as it came
nearer, Tom saw a familiar figure in it--a red-haired, squint-eyed chap.

"Andy Foger!" exclaimed Tom.  "He's got a motor-boat!  This is the
surprise he spoke of."

The boat was rapidly approaching him, and he saw that it was painted a
vivid red.  Then he could make out the name on the bow, RED STREAK.
Andy was sending the craft toward him at a fast rate.

"You needn't think you're the only one on this lake who has a gasoline
boat!" called Andy boastfully.  "This is my new one and the fastest
thing afloat around here.  I can go all around you.  Do you want to
race?"

It was a "dare," and Tom never took such things when he could
reasonably enter a contest.  He swung his boat around so as to shoot
alongside of Andy and answered:

"Yes, I'll race you.  Where to?"

"Down opposite Kolb's dock and back to this point," was the answer.
"I'll give you a start, as my engine has three cylinders.  This is a
racing boat."

"I don't need any start," declared Tom.  "I'll race you on even terms.
Go ahead!"

Both lads adjusted their timers to get more speed.  The water began to
curl away from the sharp prows, the motors exploded faster and faster.
The race was on between the ARROW and the RED STREAK.




CHAPTER VIII

OFF ON A TRIP


Glancing with critical eyes at the craft of his rival, Tom saw that
Andy Foger had a very fine boat.  The young inventor also realized that
if he was to come anywhere near winning the race he would have to get
the utmost speed out of his engine, for the new boat the bully had was
designed primarily for racing, while Tom's was an all-around pleasure
craft, though capable of something in the speed line.

"I'll be giving you a tow in a few minutes, as soon as my engine gets
warmed up!" sneered Andy.

"Maybe," said Tom, and then he crouched down to make as little
resistance as possible to the wind.  Andy, on the contrary, sat boldly
upright at the auto steering wheel of his boat.

On rushed the two motor craft, their prows exactly even and the
propellers tossing up a bulge in the water at their sterns.  Rapidly
acquiring speed after the two lads had adjusted the timers on their
motors, the boats were racing side by side, seemingly on even terms.

The RED STREAK had a very sharp prow, designed to cut through the
water. It was of the type known as an automobile launch.  That is, the
engine was located forward, under a sort of hood, which had two hinged
covers like a bat's wings. The steering-wheel shaft went through the
forward bulkhead, slantingly, like the wheel of an auto, and was
arranged with gasoline and sparking levers on the center post in a
similar manner. At the right of the wheel was a reversing lever, by
which the propeller blades could be set at neutral, or arranged so as
to drive the boat backward. Altogether the RED STREAK was a very fine
boat and had cost considerably more than had Tom's, even when the
latter was new. All these things the young owner of the ARROW thought
of as he steered his craft over the course.

"I hardly think I can win," Tom remarked to himself in a whisper.  "His
boat is too speedy for this one.  I have a chance, though, for his
engine is new, and I don't believe he understands it as well as I do
mine.  Then, too, I am sure I have a better ignition system."

But if Tom had any immediate hopes of defeating Andy, they were doomed
to disappointment, for about two minutes after the race started the RED
STREAK forged slowly ahead.

"Come on!" cried the red-haired lad.  "I thought you wanted a race."

"I do," answered the young inventor.  "We're a long way from the dock
yet, and we've got to come back."

"You'll be out of it by the time I get to the dock," declared Andy.

Indeed it began to look so, for the auto boat was now a full length
ahead of Tom's craft and there was open water between them.  But our
hero knew a thing or two about racing, though he had not long been a
motor-boat owner.  He adjusted the automatic oiler on the cylinders to
give more lubrication, as he intended to get more speed out of his
engine.  Then he opened the gasoline cock a trifle more and set his
timer forward a few notches to get an earlier spark.  He was not going
to use the maximum speed just yet, but he first wanted to see how the
motor of the ARROW would behave under these conditions.  To his delight
he saw his boat slowly creeping up on Andy's.  The latter, with a
glance over his shoulder, saw it too, and he advanced his spark.  His
craft forged ahead, but the rate of increase was not equal to Tom's.
"If I can keep up to him I suppose I ought to be glad," thought the
young inventor, "for his boat is away ahead of mine in rating."

Through the water the sharp bows cut.  There were only a few witnesses
to the race, but those who were out in boats saw a pretty sight as the
two speedy craft came on toward the dock, which was the turning point.

Andy's boat reached it first, and swung about in a wide circle for the
return.  Tom decided it was time to make his boat do its best, so he
set the timer at the limit, and the spark, coming more quickly,
increased the explosions.

Up shot the ARROW and, straightening out after the turn, Tom's craft
crept along until it lapped the stern of the RED STREAK.  Andy looked
back in dismay.  Then he tried to get more speed out of his engine.  He
did cause the screw to revolve a little faster, and Tom noted that he
was again being left behind.  Then one of those things, which may
happen at any time to a gasoline motor, happened to Andy's.  It began
to miss explosions.  At first it was only occasionally, then the misses
became more frequent.

The owner of the RED STREAK with one hand on the steering wheel, tried
with the other to adjust the motor to get rid of the trouble, but he
only made it worse.  Andy's boat began to fall back and Tom's to creep
up.  Frantically Andy worked the gasoline and sparking levers, but
without avail.  At last one cylinder went completely out of service.

The two boats were now on even terms and were racing along side by side
toward the wooded, point, which marked the finish.

"I'll beat you yet!" exclaimed Andy fiercely.

"Better hurry up!" retorted Tom.

But the young inventor was not to have it all his own way.  With a
freakishness equal to that with which it had ceased to explode the dead
cylinder came to life again, and the RED STREAK shot ahead.  Once more
Andy's boat had the lead of a length and the finish of the race was
close at hand.  The squint-eyed lad turned and shouted: "I told you I'd
beat you!  Want a tow now?"

It began to look as though Tom would need it, but he still had
something in reserve.  One of the improvements he had put in the ARROW
was a new auxiliary ignition system.  This he now decided to use.

With a quick motion Tom threw over the switch that put it into
operation.  A hotter, "fatter" spark was at once produced, and
adjusting his gasoline cock so that a little more of the fluid would be
drawn in, making a "richer" mixture, the owner of the ARROW saw the
craft shoot forward as if, like some weary runner, new life had been
infused.

In vain did Andy frantically try to get more speed out of his motor.
He cut out the muffler, and the explosions sounded loudly over the
lake.  But it was no use.  A minute later the ARROW, which had slowly
forged ahead, crossed the bows of the RED STREAK opposite the finishing
point, and Tom had won the race.

"Well, was that fair?" our hero called to Andy, who had quickly shut
off some of his power as he saw his rival's daring trick.  "Did I beat
you fair?"

"You wouldn't have beaten me if my engine hadn't gone back on me,"
grumbled Andy, chagrin showing on his face.  "Wait until my motor runs
smoother and I'll give you a big handicap and beat you.  My boat's
faster than yours.  It ought to be.  It cost fifteen hundred dollars
and it's a racer."

"I guess it doesn't like racing," commented Tom as he swung the prow of
his craft down the lake toward his home.  But he knew there was some
truth in what Andy had said.  The RED STREAK was a more speedy boat,
and, with proper handling, could have beaten the ARROW.  That was where
Tom's superior knowledge came in useful.  "Just you wait, I'll beat you
yet," called Andy, after the young inventor, but the latter made no
answer.  He was satisfied.

Mr. Swift was much interested that night in his son's account of the
race.

"I had no idea yours was such a speedy boat," he said.

"Well, it wasn't originally," admitted Tom, "but the improvements I put
on it made it so.  But, dad, when are we going on our tour?  You look
more worn out than I've seen you in some time, not excepting when the
turbine model was stolen.  Are you worrying over your gyroscope
invention?"

"Somewhat, Tom.  I can't seem to hit on just what I want.  It's a
difficult problem."

"Then I tell you what let's do, dad.  Let's drop everything in the
inventive line and go off on a vacation.  I'll take you up the lake in
my boat and you can spend a week at the Lakeview Hotel at Sandport.  It
will do you good."

"What will you do, Tom?"

"Oh, Ned Newton and I will cruise about and we'll take you along any
time you want to go.  We're going to camp out nights or sleep in the
boat if it rains.  I've ordered a canopy with side curtains.  Ned and I
don't care for the hotel life in the summer.  Will you go?"

Mr. Swift considered a moment.  He did need a rest, for he had been
working hard and his brain was weary with thinking of many problems.
His son's program sounded very attractive.

"I think I will accept," said the inventor with a smile.  "When can you
start, Tom?"

"In about four days.  Ned Newton will get his vacation then and I'll
have the canopy on.  I'll start to work at it to-morrow.  Then we'll go
on a trip."

Sandport was a summer resort at the extreme southern end of Lake
Carlopa, and Mr. Swift at once wrote to the Lakeview Hotel there to
engage a room for himself.  In the meanwhile Tom began to put the
canopy on his boat and arrange for the trip, which would take nearly a
whole day.  Ned Newton was delighted with the prospect of a camping
tour and helped Tom to get ready.  They took a small tent and plenty of
supplies, with some food.  They did not need to carry many rations, as
the shores of the lake were lined with towns and villages where food
could be procured.

Finally all was ready for the trip and the night before the start Ned
Newton stayed at Tom's house so as to be in readiness for going off
early in the morning.  The day was all that could be desired, Tom
noted, as he and his chum hurried down to the dock before breakfast to
put their blankets in the boat.  As the young inventor entered the
craft he uttered an exclamation.

"What's the matter?" asked Ned.

"I was sure I locked the sliding door of that forward compartment," was
the reply.  "Now it's open."  He looked inside the space occupied by
the gasoline tank and cried out:  "One of the braces is gone!  There's
been some one at my boat in the night and they tried to damage her."

"Much harm done?" asked Ned anxiously.

"No, none at all, to speak of," replied Tom.  "I can easily put a new
block under the tank.  In fact, I don't really need all I have.  But
why should any one take one out, and who did it?  That's what I want to
know."

The two lads looked carefully about the dock and boat for a sign of the
missing block or any clews that might show who had been tampering with
the ARROW, but they could find nothing.

"Maybe the block fell out," suggested Ned.

"It couldn't," replied Tom.  "It was one of the new ones I put in
myself and it was nailed fast.  You can see where it's been pried
loose.  I can't understand it," and Tom thought rapidly of several
mysterious occurrences of late in which the strange man at the auction
and the person he had surprised one night in the boathouse had a part.

"Well, it needn't delay our trip," resumed the young inventor.  "Maybe
there's a hoodoo around here, and it will do us good to get away a few
days.  Come on, we'll have breakfast, get dad and start."

A little later the ARROW was puffing away up the lake in the direction
of Sandport.




CHAPTER IX

MR. SWIFT IS ALARMED


"Don't you feel better already, dad?" asked Tom that noon as they
stopped under a leaning, overhanging tree for lunch on the shore of the
lake.  "I'll leave it to Ned if you don't look more contented and less
worried."

"I believe he does," agreed the other lad.  "Well, I must say I
certainly have enjoyed the outing so far," admitted the inventor with a
smile.  "And I haven't been bothering about my gyroscope.  I think I'll
take another sandwich, Tom, and a few more olives."

"That's the way to talk!" cried the son.  "Your appetite is improving,
too.  If Mrs. Baggert could see you she'd say so."

"Oh, yes, Mrs. Baggert.  I do hope she and Garret will look after the
house and shops well," said Mr. Swift, and the old, worried look came
like a shadow over his face.

"Now don't be thinking of that, dad," advised Tom, "Of course
everything will be all right.  Do you think some of those model thieves
will return and try to get some of your other inventions?"

"I don't know, Tom.  Those men were unscrupulous scoundrels, and you
can never tell what they might do to revenge themselves on us for
defeating their plans."

"Well, I guess Garret and Mrs. Baggert will look out for them,"
remarked his son.  "Don't worry."

"Yes, it's bad for the digestion," added Ned.  "If you don't mind, Tom,
I'll have some more coffee and another sandwich myself."

"Nothing the matter with your appetite, either," commented the young
inventor as he passed the coffee pot and the plate.

They were soon on their way again, the ARROW making good time up the
lake.  Tom was at the engine, making several minor adjustments to it,
while Ned steered.  Mr. Swift reclined on one of the cushioned seats
under the shade of the canopy.  The young owner of the ARROW looked
over the stretch of water from time to time for a possible sight of
Andy Foger, but the RED STREAK was not to be seen.  The Lakeview Hotel
was reached late that afternoon and the boat was tied up to the dock,
while Tom and Ned accompanied Mr. Swift to see him comfortably
established in his room.

"Won't you stay to supper with me?" invited the inventor to his son and
the latter's chum.  "Or do you want to start right in on camp life?"

"I guess we'll stay to supper and remain at the hotel to-night,"
decided Tom.  "We got here a little later than I expected, and Ned and
I hardly have time to go very far and establish a temporary camp.
We'll live a life of luxurious ease to-night and begin to be
'wanderlusters' and get back to nature to-morrow."

In the morning Tom and his chum, full of enthusiasm for the pleasures
before them, started off, promising to come back to the hotel in a few
days to see how Mr. Swift felt.  The trip had already done the man good
and his face wore a brighter look.

Tom and Ned, in the speedy ARROW, cruised along the lakeshores all that
morning.  At noon they went ashore, made a temporary camp and arranged
to spend the night there in the tent.  After this was erected they got
out their fishing tackle and passed the afternoon at that sport, having
such good luck that they provided their own supper without having to
depend on canned stuff.

They lived this life for three days, making a new camp each night,
being favored with good weather, so that they did not have to sleep in
the boat to keep dry.  On the afternoon of the third day Tom, with a
critical glance at the sky, remarked:

"I shouldn't be surprised if it rained to-morrow, Ned."

"Me either.  It does look sort of hazy, and the wind is in a bad
quarter."

"Then what do you say to heading for the hotel? I fancy dad will be glad
to see us."

"That suits me. We can start camp life again after the storm passes."

They started for Sandport that afternoon.  When within about two miles
of the hotel dock Tom saw, just ahead of them, a small motor-boat.  Ned
observed it too and called out:

"S'pose that's Andy looking for another race?"

"No, the boat's too small for his.  We'll put over that way and see who
it is."

The other craft did not appear to be moving very rapidly and the ARROW
was soon overhauling it.  As the two chums came nearer they could hear
the puffing of the motor.  Tom listened with critical ears.

"That machine isn't working right," he remarked to his chum.

At that moment there sounded a loud explosion from the other boat and
at the same time there came over the water a shrill cry of alarm.
"That's a girl in that boat!" exclaimed Ned.  "Maybe she's hurt."

"No, the motor only backfired," observed Tom.  "But we'll go over and
see if we can help her.  Perhaps she doesn't understand it.  Girls
don't know much about machinery."

A little later the ARROW shot up alongside the other craft, which had
come to a stop.  The two lads could see a girl bending over the motor,
twirling the flywheel and trying to get it started.  "Can I help you?"
asked Tom, shutting off the power from his craft.

The young lady glanced up.  Her face was red and she seemed ill at
ease.  At the sight of the young inventor she uttered an exclamation of
relief.

"Why, Mr. Swift!" she cried.  "Oh, I'm in such trouble.  I can't make
the machine work, and I'm afraid it's broken; it exploded."

"Miss Nestor!" blurted out Tom, more surprised evidently to see his
acquaintance of the runaway again than she was at beholding him.  "I
didn't know you ran a motor-boat," he added.  "I don't," said she
simply and helplessly.  "That's the trouble, it won't run."

"How comes it that you are up here?" went on Tom.

"I am stopping with friends, who have a cottage near the Lakeview
Hotel.  They have a motor-boat and I got Dick Blythe--he's the owner of
this--to show me how to run it.  I thought I knew, and I started out a
little while ago.  At first it went beautifully, but a few minutes ago
it blew up, or--or something dreadful happened."

"Nothing very dreadful, I guess," Tom assured her.  "I think I can fix
it."  He got into the other boat and soon saw what the trouble was.
The carburetor had gotten out of adjustment and the gasoline was not
feeding properly.  The young inventor soon had it in order, and,
testing the motor, found that it worked perfectly.

"Oh, I can't thank you enough," cried Miss Nestor with a flash from her
brown eyes that made Tom's heart beat double time.  "I was afraid I had
damaged the boat, and I knew Dick, who is a sort of second cousin of
mine, would never forgive me."

"There's no harm done," Tom assured her.  "But you had better keep near
us on your way back, that is, if you are going back."

"Oh, indeed I am.  I was frightened when I found I'd come so far away
from shore, and then, when that explosion took place--well, you can
imagine how I felt.  Indeed I will keep near you.  Are you stopping
near here?  If you are, I wish you'd come and see me, you and Mr.
Newton," she added, for Tom had introduced his chum.

"I'll be very glad to," answered our hero, and he told how he happened
to be in the neighborhood.  "I'll give you a few lessons in managing a
boat, if you like," he added.

"Oh, will you?  That will be lovely!  I won't tell Dick about it, and
I'll surprise him some day by showing him how well I can run his boat."

"Good idea," commented Tom.

He started the motor for Miss Nestor, having stopped it after his first
test, and then, with the DOT, which was the name of the small boat Miss
Nestor was in, following the larger ARROW, the run back to the hotel
was made.  The young lady turned off near the Lakeview dock to go to
the cottage where she was stopping and the lads tied up at the hotel
boathouse.

"Yes, we are in for a storm," remarked Tom as he and his chum walked up
toward the hotel.  "I wonder how dad is?  I hope the outing is doing
him good."

"There he comes now," observed Ned, and, looking up, Tom saw his father
approaching.  The young inventor was at once struck by the expression
on his parent's face.  Mr. Swift looked worried and Tom anxiously
hastened forward to meet him.

"What's the matter dad?" he asked as cheerfully as he could.  "Have you
been figuring over that gyroscope problem again, against my express
orders?" and he laughed a little.

"No, Tom, it's not the gyroscope that's worrying me."

"What is it then?"

"Those scoundrels are around again, Tom!" and Mr. Swift looked
apprehensively about him.

"You mean the men who stole the turbine model?"

"Yes.  I was walking in the woods near the hotel yesterday and I saw
Anson Morse.  He did not see me, for I turned aside as quickly as I had
a glimpse of him.  He was talking to another man."

"What sort of a man?"

"Well, an ordinary enough individual, but I noticed that he had
tattooed on the little finger of his left hand a blue ring."

"Happy Harry, the tramp!" exclaimed Tom.  "What can he and Morse be
doing here?"

"I don't know, Tom, but I'm worried.  I wish I was back home.  I'm
afraid something may happen to some of my inventions.  I want to go
back to Shopton, Tom."

"Nonsense, dad.  Don't worry just because you saw some of your former
enemies.  Everything is all right at home.  Mrs. Baggert and Garret
Jackson will look after things.  But, if you like, I, can find out for
you how matters are."

"How, Tom?"

"By taking a run down there in my motor-boat.  I can do it to-morrow
and get back by night, if I start early.  Then you will not worry."

"All right, Tom; I wish you would.  Come up to my room and we will talk
it over.  I'd rather leave you go than telephone, as I don't like to
talk of my business over the wire if I can avoid it."




CHAPTER X

A CRY FOR HELP


"Now, dad, tell me all about it," requested Tom when he and Ned were in
Mr. Swift's apartment at the hotel, safe from the rain that was
falling.  "How did you happen to see Anson Morse and Happy Harry?" My
old readers will doubtless remember that the latter was the disguised
tramp who was so vindictive toward Tom, while Morse was the man who
endeavored to sneak in Mr. Swift's shop and steal a valuable invention.

"Well, Tom," proceeded the inventor, "there isn't much to tell.  I was
out walking in the woods yesterday, and when I was behind a clump of
bushes I heard voices.  I looked out and there I saw the two men."

"At first I thought they were trailing me, but I saw that they had not
seen me, and I didn't see how they could know I was in the
neighborhood.  So I quietly made my way back to the hotel."

"Could you hear what they were saying?"

"Not all, but they seemed angry over something.  The man with the blue
ring on his finger asked the other man whether Murdock had been heard
from."

"Who is Murdock?"

"I don't know, unless he is another member of the gang or unless that
is an assumed name."

"It may be that.  What else did you hear?"

"The man we know as Morse replied that he hadn't heard from him, but
that he suspected Murdock was playing a double game.  Then the
tramp--Happy Harry--asked this question: 'Have you any clew to the
sparkler?' And Morse answered: 'No, but I think Murdock has hid it
somewhere and is trying to get away with it without giving us our
share.' Then the two men walked away, and I came back to the hotel,"
finished Mr. Swift.

"Sparkler," murmured Tom.  "I wonder what that can be?"

"That's a slang word for diamonds," suggested Ned.

"So it is.  In that case, dad, I think we have nothing to worry about.
Those fellows must be going to commit a diamond robbery or perhaps it
has already taken place."

The inventor seemed relieved at this theory of his son.  His face
brightened and he said: "If they are going to commit a robbery, Tom, we
ought to notify the police."

"But if they said that 'Murdock,' whoever he is, had the sparkler and
was trying to get away with it without giving them their share,
wouldn't that indicate that the robbery had already taken place?" asked
Ned.

"That's so," agreed Tom.  "But it won't do any harm to tell the hotel
detective that suspicious characters are around, no matter if the robbery
has been committed.  Then he can be on the lookout.  But I don't think we
have anything to worry about, dad.  Still, if you like, I'll take a run
down to the house to see that everything is all right, though I'm sure
it will be found that we have nothing to be alarmed over."

"Well, I will be more relieved if you do," said the inventor, "However,
suppose we have a good supper now and you boys can stay at the hotel
to-night.  Then you and Ned can start off early in the morning."

"All right," agreed Tom, but there was a thoughtful look on his face
and he appeared to be planning something that needed careful attention
to details.

After supper that night Tom took his chum to one side and asked: "Would
you mind very much if you didn't make the trip to Shopton with me?"

"No, Tom, of course not, if it will help you any.  Do you want me to
stay here?"

"I think it will be a good plan.  I don't like to leave dad alone if
those scoundrels are around.  Of course he's able to look after
himself, but sometimes he gets absent minded from thinking too much
about his inventions."

"Of course I'll stay here at the hotel.  This is just as good a
vacation as I could wish."

"Oh, I don't mean all the while.  Just a day or so--until I come back.
I may be here again by to-morrow night and find that my father is
needlessly alarmed.  Then something may have happened at home and I
would be delayed.  If I should be, I'd feel better to know that you
were here."

"Then I'll stay, and if I see any of those men--"

"You'd better steer clear of them," advised Tom quickly.  "They are
dangerous customers."

"All right.  Then I'll go over and give Miss Nestor lessons on how to
run a motor-boat," was the smiling response.  "I fancy, with what she
and I know, we can make out pretty well."

"Hold on there!" cried Tom gaily.  "No trespassing, you know."

"Oh, I'll just say I'm your agent," promised Ned with a grin.  "You
can't object to that."

"No, I s'pose not.  Well, do the best you can.  She is certainly a nice
girl."

"Yes, but you do seem to turn up at most opportune times.  Luck is
certainly with you where she is concerned.  First you save her in a
runaway--"

"After I start the runaway," interrupted Tom.

"Then you take her for a ride in your motor-boat, and, lastly, you come
to her relief when she is stalled in the middle of the lake.  Oh you
certainly are a lucky dog!"

"Never mind, I'm giving you a show.  Now let's get to bed early, as I
want to get a good start."

Tom awoke to find a nasty, drizzling rainstorm in progress, and the
lake was almost hidden from view by a swirling fog.  Still he was not
to be daunted from his trip to Shopton by the weather, and, after a
substantial breakfast, he bade his father and Ned good-by and started
off in the ARROW.

The canopy he had provided was an efficient protection against the
rain, a celluloid window in the forward hanging curtains affording him
a view so that he could steer.

Through the mist puffed the boat, the motor being throttled down to
medium speed, for Tom was not as familiar with the lake as he would
like to have been, and he did not want to run aground or into another
craft.

He was thinking over what his father had told him about the presence of
the men and vainly wondering what might be their reference to the
"sparkler."  His thoughts also dwelt on the curious removal of the
bracing block from under the gasoline tank of his boat.

"I shouldn't be surprised but what Andy Foger did that," he mused.
"Some day he and I will have a grand fight, and then maybe he'll let me
alone.  Well, I've got other things to think about now.  The hotel
detective can keep a lookout for the men around the hotel, after the
warning I gave him, and I'll see that all is right at home."

The fog lifted somewhat and Tom put on more speed.  As he was steering
the boat along near shore he heard, off to the woods at his right, the
report of a gun.  It came so suddenly that he jumped involuntarily.  A
moment later there sounded, plainly through the damp air, a cry for
help.

"Some one's hurt--shot!" cried the youth aloud.

He turned the boat in toward the bank.  As he shut off the power from
the motor he heard the cry again:

"Help! Help!  Help!"

"I must go ashore!" he exclaimed.  "Probably some one is badly wounded
by a gun."

He paused for a moment as the fear came to him that it might be some of
the patent thieves.  Then, dismissing that idea as the ARROW's prow
touched the gravel, Tom sprang out, drew the boat up a little way,
fastened the rope to a tree and hurried off into the dripping woods in
the direction of the voice that was calling for aid.




CHAPTER XI

A QUICK RUN


"Where are you?"  cried Tom.  "Are you hurt?  Where are you?"

Uttering these words after he had hurried into the woods a short
distance, the young inventor paused for an answer.  At first he could
hear nothing but the drip of water from the branches of the trees;
then, as he listened intently, he became aware of a groan not far away.

"Where are you?"  cried the lad again.  "I've come to help you.  Where
are you?"

He had lost what little fear he had had at first, that it might be one
of the unscrupulous gang, and came to the conclusion that he might
safely offer to help.

Once more the groan sounded and it was followed by a faint voice
speaking:

"Here I am, under the big oak tree.  Oh, whoever you are, help me
quickly!  I'm bleeding to death!"

With the sound of the voice to guide him, Tom swung around.  The appeal
had come from the left and, looking in that direction, he saw, through
the mist, a large oak tree.  Leaping over the underbrush toward it he
caught sight of the wounded man at its foot.  Beside him lay a gun and
there was a wound in the man's right arm.

"Who shot you?"  cried Tom, hurrying to the side of the man.  "Was it
some of those patent thieves?"  Then, realizing that a stranger would
know nothing of the men who had stolen the model, Tom prepared to
change the form of his question.  But, before he had an opportunity to
do this, the man, whose eyes were closed, opened them, and, as he got a
better sight of his face, Tom uttered a cry.

"Why, it's Mr. Duncan!"  exclaimed the lad.  He had recognized the rich
hunter, whom he had first met in the woods that spring shortly after
Happy Harry, the tramp, had disabled Tom's motor-cycle.  "Mr. Duncan,"
the young inventor repeated, "how did you get shot?"

"Is that you, Tom Swift?"  asked the gunner.  "Help me, please.  I must
stop this bleeding in my arm.  I'll tell you about it afterward.  Wind
something around it tight--your handkerchief will do."

The man sighed weakly and his eyes closed again.  The lad saw the blood
spurting from an ugly wound.

"I must make a tourniquet," the youth exclaimed.  "That will check the
bleeding until I can get him to a doctor."

With Tom to think was to act.  He took out his knife and cut off Mr.
Duncan's sleeves below the injury, slashing through coat and shirts.
Then he saw that part of a charge of shot had torn away some of the
large muscular development of the upper arm.  The hunter seemed to have
fainted and the youth worked quickly.  Tying his handkerchief above the
wound and inserting a small stone under the cloth, so that the pebble
would press on the main artery, Tom put a stick in the handkerchief and
began to twist it.  This had the effect of tightening the linen around
the arm, and in a few seconds the lad was glad to see that the blood
had stopped spurting out with every beat of the heart.  Giving the
tourniquet a few more twists to completely stop the flow of blood, Tom
fastened the stick-lever in place by a bit of string.

"That's--that's better," murmured Mr. Duncan.  "Now if you can go for a
doctor--"  He had to pause for breath.

"I'll not leave you here alone while I go for a doctor," declared Tom.
"I have my motor-boat on the lake.  Do you think I could get you down
to it and take you home?"

"Perhaps--maybe.  I'll be stronger in a moment, now that the bleeding
has stopped.  But not--not home--frighten my wife.  Take me to the
sanitarium if you can--sanitarium up the lake, a few miles from here."

The unfortunate man, who had tried to sit upright, had to lean back
against the tree again.  Tom understood what he meant in spite of the
broken sentences.  Mr. Duncan did not want to be taken home in the
condition he was then in, for fear of alarming his wife.  He wanted to
be taken to the sanitarium, and Tom knew where this was, a well-known
resort for the treatment of various diseases and surgical cases.  It
was about five miles away and on the opposite shore of the lake.

"Water--a drink!"  murmured Mr. Duncan.

Seeing that his patient would be all right, for a few minutes at least,
Tom hurried to his motor-boat, got a cup and, filling it with water
from a jug he carried, he hastened with it to the hunter.  The fluid
revived the man wonderfully and now that the bleeding had almost
completely stopped, Mr. Duncan was much stronger.

"Do you think you can get to the boat, if I help you?"  asked Tom.

"Yes, I believe so.  To think of meeting you again, and under such
circumstances!  It is providential."

"Did someone shoot you?"  inquired Tom, who could not get out of his
head the notion of the men who had once assaulted him.

"No, I shot myself," answered Mr. Duncan as he got to his feet with
Tom's help.  "I was out with my gun, practicing just as I was that day
when I met you in the woods.  I stooped down to crawl under a bush and
the weapon went off, the muzzle being close against my arm.  I can't
understand how it happened.  I fell down and called for help.  Then I
guess I must have fainted, but I came to when I heard you talking to
me.  I shouldn't have come out to-day as it is so wet, but I had some
new shot shells I wished to try in order to test them before the
hunting season.  But if I can get to the sanitarium, I will be well
taken care of.  I know one of the doctors there."

With Tom leading him and acting as a sort of support, the journey to
the motor-boat was slowly made.  Making as comfortable a bed as
possible out of the seat cushions, Tom assisted Mr. Duncan to it, and
then starting the engine he sent his boat out from shore at half speed,
as the fog was still thick and he did not want to run upon a rock.

"Do you know where the sanitarium is?"  asked the wounded hunter.

"About," answered Tom a little doubtfully, "but I'm afraid it's going
to be hard to locate it in this fog."

"There's a compass in my coat pocket," said Mr. Duncan.  "Take it out
and I'll tell you how to steer.  You ought to carry a compass if you're
going to be a sailor."

Tom was beginning to think so himself and wondered that he had not
thought of it before.  He found the one the hunter had, and placing it
on the seat near him, he carefully listened to the wounded man's
directions.  Tom easily comprehended and soon had the boat headed in
the proper direction.  After that it was comparatively easy to keep on
the right course, even in the fog.

But there was another danger, however, and this was that he might run
into another boat.  True, there were not many on Lake Carlopa, but
there were some, and one of the few motor-boats might be out in spite
of the bad weather.

"Guess I'll not run at full speed," decided Tom.  "I wouldn't like to
crash into the RED STREAK.  We'd both sink."

So he did not run his motor at the limit and sat at the steering-wheel,
peering ahead into the fog for the first sight of another craft.

He turned to look at Mr. Duncan and was alarmed at the pallor of his
face.  The man's eyes were closed and he was breathing in a peculiar
manner.

"Mr. Duncan," cried Tom, "are you worse?"

There was no answer.  Leaving the helm for a moment, Tom bent over the
injured hunter.  A glance showed him what had happened.  The tourniquet
had slipped and the wound was bleeding again.  Tom quickly shut off the
motor, so that he might give his whole attention to the work of
tightening the handkerchief.  But something seemed to be wrong.  No
matter how tightly he twisted the stick the blood did not stop flowing.
The lad was frightened.  In a short time the man would bleed to death.

"I've got to get him to the sanitarium in record time!"  exclaimed Tom.
"Fog or no fog, I've got to run at full speed!  I've got to chance it!"

Making the bandage as tight as he could and fastening it in place, the
young inventor sprang to the motor and set it in motion.  Then he went
to the wheel.  In a few minutes the ARROW was speeding through the
water as it had never done before, except when it had raced the RED
STREAK.  "If I hit anything--good-by!"  thought Tom grimly.  His hands
were tense on the rim of the steering-wheel and he was ready in an
instant to reverse the motor as he sat there straining his eyes to see
through the curtain of mist that hung over the lake.  Now and then he
glanced at the compass, to keep on the right course, and from time to
time he looked at Mr. Duncan.  The hunter was still unconscious.

How Tom accomplished that trip he hardly remembered afterward.  Through
the fog he shot, expecting any moment to crash into some other boat.
He did pass a rowing craft in which sat a lone fisherman.  The lad was
upon him in an instant, but a turn of the wheel sent the ARROW safely
past, and the startled fisherman, whose frail craft was set to rocking
violently by the swell from the motor-boat, sent an objecting cry
through the fog after Tom.  But the youth did not reply.  On and on he
raced, getting the last atom of power from his motor.

He feared Mr. Duncan would be dead when he arrived, but when he saw the
dock of the sanitarium looming up out of the mist and shut off the
power to slowly run up to it, he placed his hand on the wounded man's
heart and found it still beating.

"He's alive, anyhow," thought the youth, and then his craft bumped up
against the bulkhead and a man in the boathouse on the dock was sent on
the run for a physician.

Mr. Duncan was quickly taken up to the sanitarium on a stretcher and
Tom followed.

"You must have made a record run," observed one of the physicians a
little while afterward, when Tom was telling of his trip while waiting
in the office to hear the report on the hunter's condition.

"I guess I did," muttered the young inventor "only I didn't think so at
the time.  It seemed as if we were only crawling along."




CHAPTER XII

SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS


Under the skill of the physicians at the lake sanitarium Mr. Duncan's
wound was quickly attended to and the bleeding, which Tom had partly
checked, was completely stopped.  Some medicines having been
administered, the hunter regained a little of his strength, and, about
an hour after he had been brought to the resort, he was able to see
Tom, who, at his request, was admitted to his room.  The young inventor
found Mr. Duncan propped up in bed, with his injured arm bandaged.

"Is the injury a bad one?"  asked Tom, entering softly.

"Not as bad as I feared," replied the hunter, while a trained nurse
placed a chair for the lad at the bedside.  "If it had not been for
you, though, I'm afraid to think of what might have happened."

"I am glad I chanced to be going past when you called," replied the lad.

"Well, you can imagine how thankful I am," resumed Mr. Duncan.  "I'll
thank you more properly at another time.  I hope I didn't delay you on
your trip."

"It's not of much consequence," responded the youth.  "I was only going
to see that everything was all right at our house," and he explained
about his father being at the hotel and mentioned his worriment.  "I
will go on now unless I can do something more for you," resumed Tom.
"I will probably stay at our house all night to-night instead of trying
to get back to Sandport."

"I'd like to send word to my wife about what has happened," said the
hunter.  "If it would not be too much out of your way, I'd appreciate
it if you could stop at my home in Waterford and tell her, so she will
not be alarmed at my absence."

"I'll do it," replied our hero.  "There is no special need of my
hurrying.  I have brought your gun and compass up from the boat.  They
are down in the office."

"Will you do me a favor?"  asked Mr. Duncan quickly.

"Of course."

"Then please accept that gun and compass with my compliments.  They are
both of excellent make, and I don't think I shall use that gun this
season.  My wife would be superstitious about it.  As for the compass,
you'll need one in this fog, and I can recommend mine as being
accurate."

"Oh, I couldn't think of taking them," expostulated Tom, but his eyes
sparkled in anticipation, for he had been wishing for a gun such as Mr.
Duncan owned.  He also needed a compass.

"If you don't take them I shall feel very much offended," the hunter
said, "and the nurse here will tell you that sick persons ought to be
humored.  Hadn't they?"  and he appealed to the pretty young woman, who
was smiling at Tom.

"That's perfectly true," she said, showing her white, even teeth.  "I
think, Mr. Swift, I shall have to order you to take them."

"All right," agreed Tom, "only it's too much for what I did."

"It isn't half enough," remarked Mr. Duncan solemnly.  "Just explain
matters to my wife, if you will, and tell her the doctor says I can be
out in about a week.  But I'm not going hunting or practicing shots
again."

A little later Tom, with the compass before him to guide him on his
course through the fog, was speeding his boat toward Waterford.  Now
and then he glanced at the fine shotgun which he had so unexpectedly
acquired.

"This will come in handy this fall!"  he exclaimed.  "I'll go hunting
quail and partridge as well as wild ducks.  This compass is just what I
need, too."

Mrs. Duncan was at first very much alarmed when Tom started to tell her
of the accident, but she soon calmed down as the lad went more into
details and stated how comparatively out of danger her husband now was.
The hunter's wife insisted that Tom remain to dinner, and as he had
made up his mind he would have to devote two days instead of one to the
trip to his house, he consented.

The fog lifted that afternoon, and Tom, rejoicing in the sunlight,
which drove away the storm clouds, speeded up the ARROW until she was
skimming over the lake like a shaft from a bow.

"This is something like," he exclaimed.  "I'll soon be at home, find
everything all right and telephone to dad.  Then I'll sleep in my own
room and start back in the morning."

When Tom was within a few miles of his own boathouse he heard behind
him the "put-put"  of a motor craft.  Turning, he saw the RED STREAK
fairly flying along at some distance from him.

"Andy certainly is getting the speed out of her now," he remarked.
"He'd beat me if we were racing, but the trouble with his boat and
engine is that he can't always depend on it.  I guess he doesn't
understand how to run it.  I wonder if he'll offer to race now?"

But the red-haired owner of the auto boat evidently did not intend to
offer Tom a race.  The RED STREAK went on down the lake, passing the
ARROW about half a mile away.  Then the young inventor saw that Andy
had two other lads in the boat with him.

"Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey, I guess," he murmured.  "Well, they're
a trio pretty much alike.  The farther off they are the better I like
it."

Tom once more gave his attention to his own boat.  He was going at a
fair speed, but not the limit, and he counted on reaching home in about
a half hour.  Suddenly, when he was just congratulating himself on the
smooth-running qualities of his motor, which had not missed an
explosion, the machinery stopped.

"Hello!"  exclaimed the young inventor in some alarm.  "What's up now?"

He quickly shut off the gasoline and went back to the motor.  Now there
are so many things that may happen to a gasoline engine that it would
be difficult to name them all offhand, and Tom, who had not had very
much experience, was at a loss to find what had stopped his machinery.
He tried the spark and found that by touching the wire to the top of
the cylinder, when the proper connection was, made, that he had a hot,
"fat one."  The compression seemed all right and the supply pipe from
the gasoline tank was in perfect order.  Still the motor would not go.
No explosion resulted when he turned the flywheel over, not even when
he primed the cylinder by putting a little gasoline in through the
cocks on the cylinder heads.

"That's funny," he remarked to himself as he rested from his labors and
contemplated the "dead" motor.  "First time it has gone back on me."
The boat was drifting down the lake, and, at the sound of another motor
craft approaching, Tom looked up.  He saw the RED STREAK, containing
Andy Foger and his cronies.  They had observed the young inventor's
plight.

"Want a tow?"  sneered Andy.

"What'll you take for your second-hand boat that won't run?" asked Pete
Bailey.

"Better get out of the way or you might be run down," added Sam
Snedecker.

Tom was too angry and chagrined to reply, and the RED STREAK swept on.

"I'll make her go, if it takes all night!" declared Tom energetically.
Once more he tried to start the motor.  It coughed and sighed, as if in
protest, but would not explode.  Then Tom cried: "The spark plug!
That's where the trouble is, I'll wager.  Why didn't I think of it
before?"

It was the work of but a minute to unscrew the spark plugs from the
tops of the cylinders.  He found that both had such accumulations of
carbon on them that no spark could ever have reached the mixture of
gasoline and air.

"I'll put new ones in," he decided, for he carried a few spare plugs
for emergencies.  Inside of five minutes, with the new plugs in place,
the motor was running better than before.

"Now for home!"  cried Tom, "and if I meet Andy Foger I'll race him
this time."

But the RED STREAK was not in sight, and, a little later, Tom had run
the ARROW into the boathouse, locked the door and was on his way up to
the mansion.

"I suppose Mrs. Baggert and Garret will be surprised to see me," he
remarked.  "Maybe they'll think we don't trust them, by coming back in
this fashion to see that everything is safe.  But then, I suppose, dad
is naturally nervous about some of his valuable machinery and
inventions.  I think I'll find everything all right, though."

As Tom went up the main path and swung off to a side one, which was a
short cut to the house, he saw in the dusk, for it was now early
evening, a movement in the bushes that lined the walk.

"Hello, Garret!"  exclaimed the lad, taking it for granted it was the
engineer employed by Mr. Swift.

There was no reply, and Tom, with a sudden suspicion, sprang toward the
bushes.  The shrubbery was more violently agitated and, as the lad
reached the screen of foliage, he saw a man spring up from the ground
and take to his heels.

"Here!  Who are you?  What do you want?"  yelled Tom.

Hardly had he spoken when from behind a big apple tree another man
sprung.  It was light enough so that the lad could see his face, and a
glimpse of it caused him to cry out:

"Happy Harry, the tramp!"

Before he could call again the two men had disappeared.




CHAPTER XIII

TOM IN DANGER


"Garret!  Garret Jackson!" cried Tom as he struggled through the hedge
of bushes and ran after the men.  "Where are you, Garret?  Come on and
help me chase these men!"

But there came no answer to Tom's hail.  He could not hear the sound of
the retreating footsteps of the men now and concluded that they had
made their escape.  Still he would not give up, but dashed on, slipping
and stumbling, now and then colliding with a tree.

"What can they be doing here?" thought Tom in great anxiety.  "Are they
after some more of dad's inventions because they didn't get his turbine
motor?"

"Hello!  Who's there?  Who are you?" called a voice suddenly.

"Oh, Garret!  Where have you been?" asked the young inventor,
recognizing the tones of his father's keeper.  "I've been calling you.
Some of those scoundrels are around again!"

"Why if it isn't Tom!" ejaculated the engineer.  "However in the world
did you get here?  I thought you were at Sandport."

"I'll explain later, Garret.  Just now I want to catch those men, if I
can."

"Which men?"

"Happy Harry and another one.  I saw them hiding down by the orchard
path.  Come on, they're right ahead of us."

But though they hunted as well as they were able to in the
fast-gathering darkness, there was no trace of the intruders.  They had
to give up, and Tom, after going to the boathouse to see that the ARROW
was all right, returned to the house, where he told the engineer and
housekeeper what had brought him back and how he had surprised the two
men.

"Is everything all right, Garret?" he concluded.  "Dad is nervous and
frightened.  I must telephone him at the hotel to-night and let him
know, for I promised to come back.  I can't, though, until to-morrow."

"Everything is all right as far as I know," answered Jackson.  "I've
kept a careful watch and the burglar alarm has been in working order.
Mrs. Baggert and I haven't been disturbed a single night since you went
away.  It's curious that the men should be here the very night you come
back.  Maybe they followed you."

"I hardly think so, for they didn't know I was coming."

"You can't tell what those fellows know," commented the engineer.
"But, anyhow, I don't suppose they could have gotten here from Sandport
as soon as you did."

"Oh, yes they could, in their automobile," declared Tom.  "But I don't
believe they knew I was coming.  They knew we were away, however, and
thought it would be a good time to steal something, I guess.  Are you
sure nothing has been taken?"

"Perfectly sure, but you and I will take a look around the shop."

They made a hasty examination, but found nothing disturbed and no signs
that anyone had tried to break in.

"I think I'll telephone dad that everything is all right," decided Tom.
"It is as far as his inventions are concerned, and if I tell about
seeing the men it will only worry him.  I can explain that part better
when I see him.  But when I go back, Garret, you will have to be on
your guard, since those men are in the neighborhood."

"I will, Tom.  Don't worry."

Mr. Swift was soon informed by his son over the telephone that nothing
in the shops had been disturbed, and the inventor received the news
with evident satisfaction.  He requested Tom to come back to the hotel
in the morning, in order that the three of them might go for a ride
about the lake in the afternoon, and Tom decided to make an early start.

The night passed without incident, though Tom, who kept the gun Mr.
Duncan had given him in readiness for use, got up several times,
thinking he heard suspicious noises.  After an early breakfast, and
having once more cautioned the engineer and housekeeper to be on their
guard, Tom started back in the ARROW.

As it would not be much out of his way, the young inventor decided to
cut across the lake and stop at the sanitarium, that he might inquire
about Mr. Duncan.  He thought he could speed the ARROW up sufficiently
to make up for any time he might lose, and, with this in mind, he
headed out toward the middle of Lake Carlopa.  The engine was working
splendidly with the new spark plugs, and Tom was wondering if there was
any possible method of getting more revolutions out of the motor.  He
had about come to the conclusion that a new propeller might answer his
purpose when he heard the noise of an approaching boat.  He looked up
quickly and exclaimed:

"Andy Foger again, and Pete and Sam are with him.  It's a wonder he
wouldn't go off on a trip instead of cruising around so near home.
Guess he's afraid he'll get stuck."

Idly Tom watched the RED STREAK.  It was cutting through the water at a
fast rate, throwing up curling foam on either side of the sharp bow.
"He seems to be heading this way," mused Tom.  "Well, I'm not going to
race with him to-day."

Nearer and nearer came the speedy craft, straight for the ARROW.  The
young inventor shifted his helm in order to get out of Andy's course,
but to his surprise he saw that the red haired lad changed the
direction of his own boat.

"Guess he wants to see how close he can come to me," thought our hero.
"Maybe he wants to show how fast he's going."

The RED STREAK was now so close that the features of the occupants
could easily be distinguished.  There were grins on the faces of Andy
and his cronies.

"Get out of the way or we'll run you down!" cried the bully.  "We've
got the right of way."

"Don't you try anything like that!" shouted Tom in some alarm, not that
he was afraid of Andy, but the RED STREAK was getting dangerously near,
and he knew Andy was not a skillful helmsman.  The auto-boat was now
headed directly at the ARROW and coming on speedily.  Andy was bending
over the wheel and Tom had begun to turn his, in order to get well out
of the way of the insolent, squint-eyed lad and his friends.

Suddenly Andy uttered a cry and leaped up.

"Look out!  Look out!" he yelled.  "My steering gear has broken!  I
can't change my course.  Look out!"

The RED STREAK was bearing right down on Tom's boat.

"Shut off your power!  Reverse!" shouted Tom.

Andy seemed confused and did not know what to do.  Sam Snedecker sprang
to the side of his crony, but he knew even less about a motor-boat.  It
looked as if Tom would be run down, and he was in great danger.

But the young inventor did not lose his head.  He put his wheel hard
over and then, leaping to his motor, sent it full speed forward.  Not a
moment too soon had he acted, for an instant later the other boat shot
past the stern of the ARROW, hitting it a severe but glancing blow.
Tom's boat quivered from end to end and he quickly shut off the power.
By this time Andy had succeeded in slowing down his craft.  The young
inventor hastily looked over the side of the ARROW.  One of the rudder
fastenings had been torn loose.

"What do you mean by running me down?" shouted Tom angrily.

"I--I didn't do it on purpose," returned Andy contritely.  "I was
seeing how near I could come to you when my steering gear broke.  I
hope I haven't damaged you."

"My rudder's broken," went on Tom "and I've got to put back to repair
it.  I ought to have you arrested for this!"

"I'll pay for the damage," replied Andy, and he was so frightened that
he was white, in spite of his tan and freckles.

"That won't do me any good now," retorted Tom.  "It will delay me a
couple of hours.  If you try any tricks like that again, I'll complain
to the authorities and you won't be allowed to run a boat on this lake."

Andy knew that his rival was in the right and did not reply.  The bully
and his cronies busied themselves over the broken steering gear, and
the young inventor, finding that he could make a shift to get back to
his boathouse, turned his craft around and headed for there, in order
to repair the damage.




CHAPTER XIV

THE ARROW DISAPPEARS


Paying no heed to the occupants of the bully's boat, who, by reason of
their daring, had been responsible for his accident that might have
resulted seriously, Tom was soon at his dock.  He had it conveniently
arranged for hoisting craft out of the water to repair them, and in a
few minutes the stern of the ARROW was elevated so that he could get at
the rudder.

"Well, it's not as bad as I thought," he remarked when, with critical
eye, he had noted the damage done.  "I can fix it in about an hour if
Garret helps me."

Going up to the house to get some tools and to tell the engineer that
he had returned, Tom looked out over the lake and saw Andy's boat
moving slowly off.

"They've got her fixed up in some kind of shape," he murmured.  "It's a
shame for a chump like Andy to have a good boat like that.  He'll spoil
it in one season.  He's getting altogether too reckless.  First thing
he knows, he and I will have a clash and I'll pay back some of the old
scores."

Mr. Jackson was much surprised to see the young inventor home again so
soon, as was also Mrs. Baggert.  Tom explained what had happened, and
he and the engineer went to work repairing the damage done by the RED
STREAK.  As the owner of the ARROW had anticipated, the work did not
take long, and, shortly before dinner time, the boat was ready to
resume the interrupted trip to Sandport.

"Better stay and have lunch," urged Mrs. Baggert.  "You can hardly get
to the hotel by night, anyhow, and maybe it would be better not to
start until to-morrow."

"No, I must get back to-night or dad would be worried," declared Tom.
"I've been gone longer now than I calculated on.  But I will have
dinner here, and, if necessary, I can do the last half of the trip
after dark.  I know the way now and I have a compass and a good
searchlight."

The ARROW was let down into the water again and tied outside the
boathouse ready for a quick start.  The dinner Mrs. Baggert provided
was so good that Tom lingered over it longer than he meant to, and he
asked for a second apple dumpling with hard sauce on.  So it was with a
very comfortable feeling indeed and with an almost forgiving spirit
toward Andy Foger that our hero started down the path to the lake.

"Now for a quick run to Sandport," he said aloud.  "I hope I shan't see
any more of those men and that dad hasn't been bothered by them.  His
suspicions about the house weren't altogether unfounded, for I did see
the tramp and some one else sneaking around, but I don't believe
they'll come back now."

Tom swung around the path that led to the dock.  As he came in sight of
the water, he stared as if he could not believe what he saw, or,
rather, what he did not see.  For there was no craft tied to the
string-piece, where he had fastened his motor-boat.  He looked again,
rubbed his eyes to make sure and then cried out:

"The ARROW is gone!"

There was no doubt of it.  The craft was not at the dock.  Breaking
into a run, Tom hastened to the boathouse.  The ARROW was not in there,
and a look across the lake showed only a few rowboats in sight.

"That's mighty funny," mused the youth.  "I wonder--"

He paused suddenly in his thoughts.

"Maybe Garret took it out to try and see that it worked all right," he
said hopefully.  "He knows how to run a boat.  Maybe he wanted to see
how the rudder behaved and is out in it now.  He got through dinner
before I did.  But I should have thought he'd have said something to me
if he was going out in it."

This was the one weak point in Tom's theory, and he felt it at once.

"I'll see if Garret is in his shop," he went on as he turned back
toward the house.

The first person he met as he headed for the group of small structures
where Mr. Swift's inventive work was carried on was Garret Jackson, the
engineer.

"I--I thought you were out in my boat!" stammered Tom.

"Your boat!  Why would I be out in your boat?" and Mr. Jackson removed
his pipe from his mouth and stared at the young inventor.

"Because it's gone!"

"Gone!" repeated the engineer, and then Tom told him.  The two hurried
down to the dock, but the addition of another pair of eyes was of no
assistance in locating the ARROW.  The trim little motor craft was
nowhere to be seen.

"I can't understand it," said Tom helplessly.  "I wasn't gone more than
an hour at dinner, and yet--"

"It doesn't take long to steal a motor-boat," commented the engineer.

"But I think I would have heard them start it," went on the lad.
"Maybe it drifted off, though I'm sure I tied it securely."

"No, there's not much likelihood of that.  There's no wind to-day and
no currents in the lake.  But it could easily have been towed off by
some one in a rowboat and then you would not have heard the motor
start."

"That's so," agreed the youth.  "That's probably how they did it.  They
sneaked up here in a rowboat and towed the ARROW off.  I'm sure of it."

"And I'll wager I know who did it," exclaimed Mr. Jackson energetically.

"Who?" demanded Tom quickly.

"Those men who were sneaking around--Happy Harry and his gang.  They
stole the boat once and they'd do it again.  Those men took your boat,
Tom."

The young inventor shook his head.

"No," he answered, "I don't believe they did."

"Why not?"

"Well, because they wouldn't dare come back here when they knew we're
on the lookout for them.  It would be too risky."

"Oh, those fellows don't care for risk," was the opinion of Mr.
Jackson.  "Take my word for it, they have your boat.  They have been
keeping watch, and as soon as they saw the dock unprotected they
sneaked up and stole the ARROW."

"I don't think so," repeated Mr. Swift's son.

"Who do you think took it then?"

"Andy Foger!" was the quick response.  "I believe he and his cronies
did it to annoy me.  They have been trying to get even with me-or at
least Andy has--for outbidding him on this boat.  He's tried several
times, but he hasn't succeeded--until now.  I'm sure Andy Foger has my
boat," and Tom, with a grim tightening of his lips, swung around as
though to start in instant pursuit.

"Where are you going?" asked Mr. Jackson.

"To find Andy and his cronies.  When I locate them I'll make them tell
me where my boat is."

"Hadn't you better send some word to your father?  You can hardly get
to Sandport now, and he'll be worried about you."

"That's so, I will.  I'll telephone dad that the boat--no, I'll not do
that either, for he'd only worry and maybe get sick.  I'll just tell
him I've had a little accident, that Andy ran into me and that I can't
come back to the hotel for a day or two.  Maybe I'll be lucky to find
my boat in that time.  But dad won't worry then, and, when I see him, I
can explain.  That's what I'll do," and Tom was soon talking to Mr.
Swift by telephone.

The inventor was very sorry his son could not come back to rejoin him
and Ned, but there was no help for it, and, with as cheerful voice as
he could assume, the lad promised to start for Sandport at the earliest
opportunity.

"Now to find Andy and my boat!" Tom exclaimed as he hung up the
telephone receiver.




CHAPTER XV

A DISMAYING STATEMENT


Trouble is sometimes good in a way; it makes a person resourceful.  Tom
Swift had had his share of annoyances of late, but they had served a
purpose.  He had learned to think clearly and quickly.  Now, when he
found his boat stolen, he at once began to map out a plan of action.

"What will you do first?" asked Mr. Jackson as he saw his employer's
son hesitating.

"First I'm going to Andy Foger's house," declared the young inventor.
"If he's home I'm going to tell him what I think of him.  If he's not,
I'm going to find him."

"Why don't you take your sailboat and run down to his dock?" suggested
the engineer.  "It isn't as quick as your motor-boat, but it's better
than walking."

"So it is," exclaimed the lad.  "I will use my catboat.  I had
forgotten all about it of late.  I'm glad you spoke."

He was soon sailing down the lake in the direction of the boathouse on
the waterfront of Mr. Foger's property.  It needed but a glance around
the dock to show him that the RED STREAK was not there, but Tom
recollected the accident to the steering gear and thought perhaps Andy
had taken his boat to some wharf where there was a repair shop and
there left it to return home himself.  But inquiry of Mrs. Foger, who
was as nice a woman as her son was a mean lad, gave Tom the information
that his enemy was not at home.

"He telephoned to me that his boat was damaged," said Mrs. Foger
gently, "and that he had taken it to get fixed.  Then, he said, he and
some friends were going on a little cruise and might not be back
to-night."

"Did he say where he was going?" asked our hero, who did not tell
Andy's mother why he wanted to see her son.

"No, and I'm worried about him.  Sometimes I think Andy is too--well,
too impetuous, and I'm afraid he will get into trouble."

Tom, in spite of his trouble, could hardly forbear smiling.  Andy's
mother was totally unaware of the mean traits of her son and thought
him a very fine chap.  Tom was not going to undeceive her.

"I'm afraid something will happen to him," she went on.  "Do you think
there is any danger being out on the lake in a motor-boat, Mr. Swift?
I understand you have one."

"Yes, I have one," answered Tom.  He was going to say he had once had
one, but thought better of it.  "No, there is very little danger this
time of year," he added.

"I am very glad to hear you say so," went on Mrs. Foger with a sigh.
"I shall feel more at ease when Andy is away now.  When he returns
home, I shall tell him you called upon him and he will return your
visit.  I am glad to see that the custom of paying calls has not died
out among the present generation.  It is a pleasant habit, and I am
glad to have my son conform to it.  He shall return your kind visit."

"Oh, no, it's of no consequence," replied Tom quickly, thinking grimly
that his visit was far from a friendly one.  "There is no need to tell
your son I was here.  I will probably see him in a day or two.

"Oh, but I shall tell him," insisted Mrs. Foger with a kind smile.
"I'm sure he will appreciate your call."

There was much doubt concerning this in the mind of the young inventor,
but he did not express it and soon took his leave.  Up and down the
lake for the rest of the day he cruised, looking in vain for a sight of
Andy Foger in the RED STREAK, but the racing boat appeared to be well
hidden.

"If I only could find where they've taken mine," mused Tom.  "Hang it
all, this is rotten luck!" and for the first time he began to feel
discouraged.

"Maybe you'd better notify the police," suggested Mr. Jackson when Tom
returned to the Swift house that night.  "They might help locate it."

"I think I can do as well as the police," answered the youth.  "If the
boat is anywhere it's on the lake, and the police have no craft in
which to make a search."

"That's so," agreed the engineer.  "I wish I could help you, but I
don't believe it would be wise for me to leave the house, especially
since those men have been about lately."

"No, you must stay here," was Tom's opinion.  "I'll take another day or
two to search.  By this time Andy and his gang will return, I'm sure,
and I can tackle them."

"Suppose they don't?"

"Well, then I'll make a tour of the lake in my sailboat and I'll run up
to Sandport and tell dad, for he will wonder what's keeping me.  I'll
know better next time than to leave my boat at the dock without taking
out the connection at the spark coil, so no one can start the motor.  I
should have done that at first, but you always think of those things
afterward."

The lad began his search again the next morning and cruised about in
little bays and gulfs looking for a sight of the RED STREAK or the
ARROW, but he saw neither, and a call at Andy's house showed that the
red-haired youth had not returned.  Mrs. Foger was quite nervous over
her son's continued absence, but Mr. Foger thought it was all right.

Another day passed without any results and the young inventor was
getting so nervous, partly with worrying over the loss of his boat and
partly on his father's account, that he did not know what to do.

"I can't stand it any longer," he announced to Mrs. Baggert the night
of the third day, after a telephone message had been received from Mr.
Swift.  The inventor wanted to know why his son did not return to the
hotel to join him and Ned.  "Well, what will you do?" asked the
housekeeper.

"If I don't find my boat to-morrow, I'll sail to Sandport, bring home
dad and Ned and we three will go all over the lake.  My boat must be on
it somewhere, but Lake Carlopa is so cut up that it could easily be
hidden."

"It's queer that the Foger boy doesn't come home.  That makes it look
as if he was guilty."

"Oh, I'm sure he took it all right," returned Tom.  "All I want is to
see him.  It certainly is queer that he stays away as long as he does.
Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey are with him, too.  But they'll have to
return some time."

Tom dreamed that night of finding his boat and that it was a wreck.  He
awoke, glad to find that the latter part was not true, but wishing that
some of his night vision might come to pass during the day.

He started out right after breakfast, and, as usual, headed for the
Foger home.  He almost disliked to ask Mrs. Foger if her son had yet
returned, for Andy's mother was so polite and so anxious to know
whether any danger threatened that Tom hardly knew how to answer her.
But he was saved that embarrassment on this occasion, for as he was
going up the walk from the lake to the residence he met the gardener
and from him learned that Andy had not yet come back.

"But his mother had a message from him, I did hear," went on the man.
"He's on his way.  It seems he had some trouble."

"Trouble.  What kind of trouble?" asked Tom.

"I don't rightly know, sir, but," and here the gardener winked his eye,
"Master Andy isn't particular what kind of trouble he gets into."

"That's right," agreed our hero, and as he went down again to where he
had left his boat he thought: "Nor what kind of trouble he gets other
people into.  I wish I had hold of him for about five minutes!"

The sailboat swung slowly from the dock and heeled over to the gentle
breeze.  Hardly knowing what to do, Tom headed for the middle of the
lake.  He was discouraged and tired of making plans only to have them
fail.

As he looked across the stretch of water he saw a boat coming toward
him.  He shaded his eyes with his hand to see better, and then, with a
pair of marine glasses, took an observation.  He uttered an exclamation.

"That's the RED STREAK as sure as I'm alive!" he cried.  "But what's
the matter with her?  They're rowing!"

The lad headed his boat toward the approaching one.  There was no doubt
about it.  It was Andy Foger's craft, but it was not speeding forward
under the power of the motor.  Slowly and laborious the occupants were
pulling it along, and as it was not meant to be rowed, progress was
very slow.

"They've had a breakdown," thought Tom. "Serves 'em right!  Now wait
till I tackle 'em and find out where my boat is.  I've a good notion to
have Andy Foger arrested!"

The sailing craft swiftly approached the motor-boat.  Tom could see the
three occupants looking at him, apprehensively as well as curiously, he
thought.

"Guess they didn't think I'd keep after 'em," mused the young inventor,
and a little later he was beside the RED STREAK.

"Well," cried Tom angrily, "it's about time you came back!"

"We've had a breakdown," remarked Andy, and he seemed quite humiliated.
He was beginning to find out that he didn't know as much about a
motor-boat as he thought he did.

"I've been waiting for you," went on Tom.

"Waiting for us?  What for?" asked Sam Snedecker.

"What for?  As if you didn't know!" blurted out the owner of the ARROW.
"I want my boat, Andy Foger, the one you stole from me and hid!  Tell
me where it is at once or I'll have you arrested!"

"Your boat!" repeated the bully, and there was no mistaking the
surprise in his tones.

"Yes, my boat!  Don't try to bluff me like that."

"I'm not trying to bluff you.  We've been away, three days and just got
back."

"Yes, I know you have.  You took my boat with you, too."

"Are you crazy?" demanded Pete Bailey.

"No, but you fellows must have been to think you could take my boat and
me not know it," and Tom, filled with wrath, grasped the gunwale of the
RED STREAK as if he feared it would suddenly shoot away.

"Look here!" burst out Andy, and he spoke sincerely, "we didn't touch
your boat.  Did we, fellows?"

"No!" exclaimed Sam and Pete at once, and they were very much in
earnest.

"We didn't even know it was stolen, did we?" went on Andy.

"No," agreed his chums.  Tom looked unconvinced.

"We haven't taken your boat and we can prove it," continued the bully.
"I know you and I have had quarrels, but I'm telling you the truth, Tom
Swift.  I never touched your boat."

There was no mistaking the sincerity of Andy.  He was not a skilful
deceiver, and Tom, looking into his squint-eyes, which were opened
unusually wide, could not but help believing the fellow.

"We haven't seen it since the day we had the collision," added Andy,
and his chums confirmed this statement.

"We went off on a little cruise," continued the red-haired bully, "and
broke down several times.  We had bad luck.  Just as we were nearing
home something went wrong with the engine again.  I never saw such a
poor motor.  But we never took your boat, Tom Swift, and we can prove
it."

Tom was in despair.  He had been so sure that Andy was the thief, that
to believe otherwise was difficult.  Yet he felt that he must.  He
looked at the disabled motor of the RED STREAK and viewed it with the
interested and expert eye of a machinist, no matter if the owner of it
was his enemy.  Then suddenly a brilliant idea came into Tom's head.




CHAPTER XVI

STILL ON THE SEARCH


"You seem to have lots of trouble with your boat, Andy," said Tom after
a few moments of rather embarrassed silence.

"I do," admitted the owner of the RED STREAK.  "I've had bad luck ever
since I got it, but usually I've been able to fix it by looking in the
book.  This time I can't find out what the trouble is, nor can any of
the fellows.  It stopped when we were out in the middle of the lake and
we had to row.  I'm sick of motor boating."

"Suppose I fix it for you?" went on Tom.

"If you do, I'll pay you well."

"I wouldn't do it for pay--not the kind you mean," continued the young
inventor.

"What do you mean then?" and Andy's face, that had lighted up, became
glum again.

"Well, if I fix your boat for you, will you let me run it a little
while?"

"You mean show me how to run it?"

"No, I mean take it myself.  Look here, Andy, my boat's been stolen,
and I thought you took it to get even with me.  You say you didn't--"

"And I didn't touch it," interposed the squint-eyed lad quickly.

"All right, I believe you.  But somebody stole it, and I think I know
who."

"Who?" asked Sam Snedecker.

"Well, you wouldn't know if I told you, but I suspect some men with
whom I had trouble before," and Tom referred to Happy Harry and his
gang.  "I think they have my boat on this lake, and I'd like to get
another speedy craft to cruise about it and make a further search.  How
about it, Andy?  If I fix your boat, will you let me take it to look
for my boat?"

"Sure thing!" agreed the bully quickly, and his voice for once was
friendly toward Tom.  "Fix the engine so it will run, and you can use
the RED STREAK as long as you like."

"Oh, I probably wouldn't want it very long.  I could cover the lake in
about three days, and I hope by that time I could locate the thieves.
Is it a bargain?"

"Sure," agreed Andy again, and Tom got into the motor-boat to look at
the engine.  He found that it would require some time to adjust it
properly and that it would be necessary to take the motor apart.

"I think I'd better tow you to my dock," the young inventor said to
Andy.  "I can use some tools from the shop then, and by to-night I'll
have the RED STREAK in running order."

The breeze was in the right quarter, fortunately, and with the
motor-boat dragging behind, the ARROW's owner put the nose of the
sailing craft toward his home dock.

When Tom reached his house he found that Mrs. Baggert had received
another telephone message from Mr. Swift, inquiring why his son had not
returned to Sandport.

"He says if you don't come back by to-morrow," repeated the
housekeeper, "that he'll come home by train.  He's getting anxious, I
believe."

"Shouldn't wonder," admitted Tom.  "But I want him to stay there.  The
change will do him good.  I'll soon have my boat back, now that I can
go about the lake swiftly, and then I'll join him.  I'll tell him to be
patient."

Tom talked with his father at some length, assuring him that everything
was well at the Shopton house and promising to soon be with him.  Then
the young inventor began work on the motor of the RED STREAK.  He found
it quite a job and had to call on Mr. Jackson to help him, for one of
the pistons had to be repaired and a number of adjustments made to the
cylinders.

But that night the motor was fully mended and placed back in the boat.
It was in better shape than it had been since Andy had purchased the
craft.

"There," remarked Tom, "now I'm ready to hunt for those scoundrels.
Will you leave your boat at my dock to-night, Andy?"

"Yes, so you can start out early in the morning.  I'm not going."

"Why not?" demanded Tom quickly.

"Well--er--you see I've had enough of motoring for a while," explained
Andy.  "Besides, I don't believe my mother would like me to go out on a
chase after thieves.  If we had to shoot I might hit one of them, and--"

"Oh, I see," answered Tom.  "But I don't like to take your boat alone.
Besides, I don't fancy there will be much shooting.  I know I'm not
going to take a gun.  In fact, the one Mr. Duncan gave me is in the
boat.  All I want is to get the ARROW back."

"That's all right," went on Andy.  "You take my boat and use it as long
as you like.  I'll rest up a few days.  When you find your boat you can
bring mine back."

Tom understood.  He was just as glad not to have Andy accompany him in
the chase, as he and the red-haired lad had never been good friends and
probably never would be.  So it would cause some embarrassment to be
together in a boat all day.  Then again Tom knew he could manage the
RED STREAK better alone, but, of course, he did not want to mention
this when he asked for the loan of the craft.  Andy's own suggestion,
however, had solved the difficulty.  Tom had an idea that Andy felt a
little timid about going in pursuit of the thieves, but naturally it
would not do to mention this, for the squint-eyed lad considered
himself quite a fighter.

Early the next morning, alone in the RED STREAK, Tom continued the
search for his stolen boat.  He started out from his home dock and
mapped out a course that would take him well around the lake.

"I s'pose I could take a run to Sandport now," mused the youth as he
shot in and out of the little bays, keeping watch for the ARROW.  "But
if I do dad will have to be told all about it, and, he'll worry.  Then,
too, he might want to accompany me, and I think I can manage this
better alone, for the RED STREAK will run faster with only one in.  I
ought to wind up this search in two days, if my boat is still on the
lake.  And if those scoundrels have sunk her I'll make them pay for it."

On shot the speedy motor-boat, in and out along the winding shoreline,
with the lad in the bow at the steering-wheel peering with eager eyes
into every nook and corner where his craft might be hidden.




CHAPTER XVII

"THERE SHE IS!"


Anticipating that he would be some time on his search, the young
inventor had gone prepared for it.  He had a supply of provisions and
he had told Mrs. Baggert he might not be back that night.  But he did
not intend to sleep aboard the RED STREAK, which, being a racing boat,
was not large enough to afford much room for passengers.  Tom had
planned, therefore, to put up at some hotel near the lake in case his
hunt should last beyond one night.

That it would do this was almost certain, for all that morning he
searched unavailingly for the ARROW.  A distant mill whistle sounding
over Lake Carlopa told him it was noon.

"Dinner time," he announced to himself.  "Guess I'll run up along shore
in the shade and eat."

Selecting a place where the trees overhung the water, forming a quiet,
cool nook, Tom sent the boat in there, and, tying it to a leaning tree,
he began his simple meal.  Various thoughts filled his mind, but chief
among them was the desire to overtake the thieves who had his boat.
That it was Happy Harry's gang he was positive.

The lad nearly finished eating and was considering what direction he
might best search in next when he heard, running along a road that
bordered the lake, an automobile.

"Wonder who that is?" mused Tom.  "It won't do any harm to take a look,
for it might be some of those thieves again.  They probably still have
their auto or Happy Harry couldn't have gotten from Sandport to Shopton
so quickly."

The young inventor slipped ashore from the motor-boat, taking care to
make no noise.  Stealing silently along toward the road, he peered
through the underbrush for a sight of the machine, which seemed to be
going slowly.  But before the youth had a glimpse of it he was made
aware who the occupant was by hearing someone exclaim:

"Bless my shoe laces if this cantankerous contraption isn't going wrong
again!  I wonder if it's going to have a fit here in this lonely place.
It acts just as if it was.  Bless my very existence! Hold on now.  Be
nice!  Be nice!"

"Mr. Damon!" exclaimed Tom, and, without knowing it, he had spoken
aloud.

"Hold on there!  Hold on!  Who's calling me in this forsaken locality?
Bless my shirt studs!  But who is it?" and the eccentric man who had
sold Tom the motor-cycle looked intently at the bushes.

"Here I am, Mr. Damon," answered the lad, stepping out into the road.
"I knew it was you as soon as I saw you."

"Bless my liver, but that's very true!  I suppose you heard my
unfortunate automobile puffing along.  I declare I don't know what ails
it.  I got it on the advice of my physician, who said I must get out in
the air, but, bless my gears, it's the auto who needs a doctor more
than I do!  It's continually out of order.  Something is going to
happen right away.  I can tell by the way it's behaving."

Mr. Damon had thrown out the clutch, but the engine was still running,
though in a jerky, uncertain fashion, which indicated to the trained
ear of the young inventor that something was wrong.

"Perhaps I can fix it for you as I did before," ventured Tom.

"Bless my eyebrows!  Perhaps you can," cried the eccentric man
hopefully.  "You always seem to turn up at the right moment.  How do
you manage it?"

"I don't know.  I remember the time you turned up just when I wanted
you to help me capture Happy Harry and his gang, and now, by, a strange
coincidence, I'm after them again."

"You don't say so!  My good gracious!  Bless my hatband!  But that's
odd.  There!" he ejaculated suddenly as the automobile engine stopped
with a choking sigh, "I knew something was going to happen."

"Let me take a look," proposed the lad, and he was soon busy peering
into the interior of the machine.  At first he could not find the
trouble, but being a persistent youth, Tom went at it systematically
and located it in two places.  The clutch was not rightly adjusted and
the carburetor float feed needed fixing.  The young inventor was not
long in making the slight repairs and then he assured Mr. Damon that
his automobile would run properly.

"Bless my very existence, but what a thing it is to have a head for
mechanics!" exclaimed the odd man gratefully.  "Now it would bother me
to adjust a nutmeg grater if it got out of order, but I dare say you
could fix it in no time."

"Yes," answered Tom, "I could and so could you, for there's nothing
about it to fix.  But you can go ahead now if you wish."

"Thank you.  It just shows how ignorant I am of machinery.  I presume
something will go wrong in another mile or two.  But may I ask what you
are doing here?  I presume you are in your motor-boat, sailing about
for pleasure.  And didn't I understand you to say you were after those
chaps again?  Bless my watch charm, but I was so interested in my
machine that I didn't think to ask you."

"Yes, I am after those thieves again."

"In your motor-boat, I presume.  Well, I hope you catch them.  What
have they stolen now?"

"My motor-boat.  That's why I'm after them, but I had to borrow a craft
to chase them with."

"Bless my soul!  You don't tell me!  How did it happen?"

Thereupon the lad related as much of the story as was necessary to put
Mr. Damon in possession of the facts and he ended up with:

"I don't suppose you have seen anything of the men in my boat, have
you?"

Mr. Damon seemed strangely excited.  He had entered his auto, but as
the lad's story progressed the odd gentleman had descended.  When Tom
finished he exclaimed:

"Don't say a word now--not a word.  I want to think, and that is a
process, which, for me, requires a little time.  Don't speak a word
now.  Bless my left hand, but I think I can help you!"

He frowned, stamped first one foot, then the other, looked up at the
sky, as if seeking inspiration there, and then down at the ground, as
if that would help him to think.  Then he clapped his hands smartly
together and cried out:

"Bless my shoe buttons!"

"Have you seen them?" asked Tom eagerly.

"Was your boat one with a red arrow painted on the bow?" asked Mr.
Damon in turn.

"It was!" and the lad was now almost as excited as was his friend.

"Then I've seen it and, what's more, this morning!  Bless my spark
plug, I've seen it!"

"Tell me about it!" pleaded the young inventor, and Mr. Damon, calming
himself after an effort, resumed:

"I was out for an early spin in my auto," he said, "and was traveling
along a road that bordered the lake, about fifteen miles above here.  I
heard a motor-boat puffing along near shore, and, looking through the
trees, I saw one containing three men.  It had a red arrow on the bow,
and that's why I noticed it, because I recalled that your boat was
named the DART."

"ARROW," corrected Tom.

"The ARROW.  Oh, yes, I knew it was something like that.  Well of
course at the time I didn't think that it was your boat, but I
associated it in my mind with yours.  Do you catch my meaning?"

Tom did and said so, wishing Mr. Damon would hurry and get to the
point.  But the eccentric character had to do things in his own way.

"Exactly," he resumed. "Well, I didn't think that was your boat, but,
at the same time, I watched the men out of curiosity, and I was struck
with their behavior. They seemed to be quarreling, and, from what I
could hear, two of them seemed to be remonstrating with the third one
for having taken some sort of a piece of wood from the forward
compartment. I believe that is the proper term."

"Yes!" Tom almost shouted.  "But where did they go?  What became of
them?  What was the man doing to the forward compartment--where the
gasoline tank is?"

"Exactly.  I was trying to think what was kept there.  That's it, the
gasoline tank.  Well, the boat kept on up the lake, and I don't know
what became of the men.  But about that piece of wood.  It seems that
one of the men removed a block, from under the tank and the others
objected.  That's why they were quarreling."

"That's very strange," exclaimed the lad.  "There must be some mystery
about my boat that I don't understand.  But that will keep until I get
the boat itself.  Good-by, Mr. Damon.  I must be off."

"Where to?"

"Up the lake after those thieves.  I must lose no time," and Tom
started to go back to where he had left the RED STREAK.

"Hold on!" cried Mr. Damon.  "I have something to propose, Tom.  Two
heads are better than one, even if one doesn't know how to adjust a
nutmeg grate.  Suppose I come along with you?  I can point out the
direction the men took, at any rate."

"I'll be very glad to have you," answered the lad, who felt that he
might need help if there were three of the thieves in his craft.  "But
what will you do with your automobile?"

"I'll just run it down the road a way to where a friend of mine has a
stable.  I'll leave it in there and join you.  Will you let me come?
Bless my eye glasses, but I'd like to help catch those scoundrels!"

"I'll be very glad to have you.  Go ahead, put the auto in the barn and
I'll wait for you."

"I have a better plan than that," replied Mr. Damon.  "Run your boat
down to that point," and he indicated one about a mile up the lake.
"I'll be there waiting for you, and we'll lose no time.  I can cover
the ground faster in my auto than you can in your boat."

Tom saw the advantage of this and was soon under way, while he heard on
shore the puffing of his friend's car.  On the trip to the point Tom
puzzled over the strange actions of the man in taking one of the braces
from under the gasoline tank.

"I'll wager he did it before," thought the lad.  "It must be the same
person who was tampering with the lock of the forward compartment the
day I bought the boat.  But why--that's the question--why?"

He could find no answer to this, puzzle over it as he did, and he gave
it up.  His whole desire now was to get on the trail of the thieves,
and he had strong hopes, after the clew Mr. Damon had given him.  The
latter was waiting for him on the point, and so nimble was the owner of
the auto, in spite of his size, that Tom was not delayed more than the
fraction of a minute ere he was under way again, speeding up the lake.

"Now keep well in toward shore," advised Mr. Damon.  "Those fellows
don't want to be observed any more than they can help, and they'll
sneak along the bank, They were headed in that direction," and he
pointed it out.  "Now I hope you won't think I'm in the way.  Besides,
you know, if you get your boat back, you'll want some one to help steer
it, while you run this one.  I can do that, at all events, bless my
very existence!"

"I am very glad of your help," replied the lad, but he did not take his
eyes from the water before him, and he was looking for a sight of his
boat with the men in it.

For three hours or more Tom and Mr. Damon cruised in and out along the
shore of the lake, going farther and farther up the body of water.  Tom
was beginning to think that he would reach Sandport without catching
sight of the thieves, and he was wondering if, after all, he might not
better stop off and see his father when, above the puffing of the motor
in the RED STREAK, he heard the put-put of another boat.

"Listen!" cried Mr. Damon, who had heard it at the same time.

Tom nodded.

"They're just ahead of us," whispered his companion.

"If it's them," was the lad's reply.

"Speed up and we'll soon see," suggested Mr. Damon, and Tom shoved the
timer over.  The RED STREAK forged ahead.  The sound of the other boat
came more plainly now.  It was beyond a little point of land.  The
young inventor steered out to get around it and leaned eagerly forward
to catch the first glimpse of the unseen craft.  Would it prove to be
the ARROW?

The put-put became louder now.  Mr. Damon was standing up, as if that
would, in some mysterious way, help.  Then suddenly the other boat came
into view.  Tom saw it in an instant and knew it for the ARROW.

"There she is!" he cried.




CHAPTER XVIII

THE PURSUIT


For an instant after Tom's exultant cry the men in the boat ahead were
not aware that they were being pursued.  Then, as the explosions from
the motor of the RED STREAK sounded over the water, they turned to see
who was coming up behind them.  There was no mistaking the attitude of
the young inventor and his companion.  They were leaning eagerly
forward, as if they could reach out and grasp the criminals who were
fleeing before them.

"Put on all the speed you can, Tom!" begged Mr. Damon.  "We'll catch
the scoundrels now.  Speed up the motor!  Oh, if I only had my
automobile now.  Bless my crank shaft, but one can go so much faster on
land than on water."

The lad did not reply, but thought, with grim humor, that running an
automobile over Lake Carlopa would be no small feat.  Mr. Damon,
however, knew what he was saying.

"We'll catch them!  We'll nab 'em!" he cried.  "Speed her up, Tom."

The youth was doing his best with the motor of the RED STREAK.  He was
not as well acquainted with it as he was with the one in his boat, but
he knew, even better than Andy Foger, how to make it do efficient work.
It was a foregone conclusion that the RED STREAK, if rightly handled,
could beat the ARROW, but there were several points in favor of the
thieves.  The motor of Tom's boat was in perfect order, and even an
amateur, with some knowledge of a boat, could make it do nearly its
best.  On the other hand, the RED STREAK's machinery needed "nursing."
Again, the thieves had a good start, and that counted for much.  But
Tom counted on two other points.  One was that Happy Harry and his gang
would probably know little about the fine points of a motor.  They had
shown this in letting the motor of the boat they had first stolen get
out of order, and Tom knew the ins and outs of a gasoline engine to
perfection.  So the chase was not so hopeless as it seemed.

"Do you think you can catch them?" asked Mr. Damon anxiously.

"I'm going to make a big try," answered his companion.

"They're heading out into the middle of the lake!" cried the eccentric
man.

"If they do, I can cut them off!" murmured Tom as he put the wheel over.

But whoever was steering the ARROW knew better than to send it on a
course that would enable the pursuing boat to cut across and shorten
the distance to it.  After sending the stolen craft far enough out from
shore to clear points of land that jutted out into the lake, the
leading boat was sent straight ahead.

"A stern chase and a long chase!" murmured Mr. Damon.  "Bless my
rudder, but those fellows are not going to give up easily."

"I guess not," murmured Tom.  "Will you steer for a while, Mr. Damon?"

"Of course I will.  If I could get out and pull the boat after me, to
make it go faster, I would.  But as I always lose my breath when I run,
perhaps it's just as well that I stay in here."  Tom thought so too,
but his attention was soon given to the engine.  He adjusted the timer
to get if possible a little more speed out of the boat he had borrowed
from Andy, and he paid particular attention to the oiling system.

"We're going a bit faster!" called Mr. Damon' encouragingly, "or else
they're slacking up."

Tom peered ahead to see if this was so.  It was hard to judge whether
he was overhauling the ARROW, as it was a stern chase, and that is
always difficult to judge.  But a glimpse along shore showed him that
they were slipping through the water at a faster speed.

"They're up to something!" suddenly exclaimed Mr. Damon a moment later.
"I believe they're going to fire on us, Tom.  They are pointing
something this way."

The lad stood up and gazed earnestly at his boat, which seemed to be
slipping away from him so fast.  One of the occupants was in the stern,
aiming some glittering object at those in the RED STREAK.  For a moment
Tom thought it might be a gun.  Then, as the man turned, he saw what it
was.

"A pair of marine glasses," cried the lad.  "They're trying to make out
who we are."

"I guess they know well enough," rejoined Mr. Damon.  "Can't you go any
faster, Tom?"

"I'm afraid not.  But we'll land them, sooner or later.  They can't go
very far in this direction without running ashore and we'll have them.
They're cutting across the lake now."

"They may escape us if it gets dark.  Probably that's what they're
working for.  They want to keep ahead of us until nightfall."

The young inventor thought of this too, but there was little he could
do.  The motor was running at top speed.  It could be made to go
faster, Tom knew, with another ignition system, but that was out of the
question now.

The man with the glasses had resumed his seat, and the efforts of the
trio seemed concentrated on the motor of the ARROW.  They, too, wished
to go faster.  But they had not skill enough to accomplish it, and in
about ten minutes, when Tom took another long and careful look to
ascertain if possible whether or not he was overhauling the thieves, he
was delighted to see that the distance between the boats had lessened.

"We're catching them!  We're creeping up on them!" cried Mr. Damon.
"Keep it up, Tom."  There was nothing to do, however, save wait.  The
boat ahead had shifted her course somewhat and was now turning in
toward the shore, for the lake was narrow at this point, and abandoning
their evident intention of keeping straight up the lake, the thieves
seemed now bent on something else.

"I believe they're going to run ashore and get out!" cried Mr. Damon.

"If they do, it's just what I want," declared the lad.  "I don't care
for the men.  I want my boat back!"

The occupants of the ARROW were looking to the rear again, and
one--Happy Harry, Tom thought--shook his fist.

"Ah, wait until I get hold of you!" cried Mr. Damon, following his
example.  "I'll make you wish you'd behaved yourselves, you scoundrels!
Bless my overcoat!  Catch them if you can, Tom."

There was now no doubt of the intention of the fleeing ones.  The shore
was looming up ahead and straight for it was headed the ARROW.  Tom
sent Andy's boat in the same direction.  He was rapidly overhauling the
escaping ones now, for they had slowed down the motor.  Three minutes
later the foremost boat grated on the beach of the lake.  The men
leaped out, one of them pausing an instant in the bow.

"Here, don't you damage my boat!" cried Tom involuntarily, for the man
seemed to be hammering something.

The fellow leaped over the side, holding something in his hand.

"There they go!  Catch them!" yelled Mr. Damon.

"Let them go!" answered the lad as the men ran toward the wood.  "I
want my boat.  I'm afraid they've damaged her.  One of them tore
something from the bow."

At the same instant the two companions of the fellow who had paused in
the forward part of the ARROW saw that he had something in his hand.
With yells of rage they dashed at him, but he, shaking his fist at
them, plunged into the bushes and could be heard breaking his way
through, while his companions were in pursuit.

"They've quarreled among themselves," commented Mr. Damon as high and
angry voices could be heard from the woods.  "There's some mystery
here, Tom."

"I don't doubt it, but my first concern is for my boat.  I want to see
if they have damaged her."

Tom had run so closely in shore with the RED STREAK that he had to
reverse to avoid damaging the craft against the bank.  In a mass of
foam he stopped her in time, and then springing ashore, he hurried to
his motor-boat.




CHAPTER XIX

A QUIET CRUISE


"Have they done any damage?" asked Mr. Damon as he stood in the bow of
the RED STREAK.

Tom did not answer for a moment.  His trained eye was looking over the
engine.

"They yanked out the high tension wire instead of stopping the motor
with the switch," he answered at length, and then, when he had taken a
look into the compartment where the gasoline tank was, he added: "And
they've ripped out two more of the braces I put in.  Why in the world
they did that I can't imagine."

"That's evidently what one man had that the others wanted," was Mr.
Damon's opinion.

"Probably," agreed Tom.  "But what could he or they want with wooden
braces?"

That was a puzzler for Mr. Damon, but he answered:

"Perhaps they wanted to damage your boat and those two men were mad
because the other got ahead of them."

"Taking out the braces wouldn't do much damage.  I can easily put
others in.  All it would do would be to cause the tank to sag down and
maybe cause a leak in the pipe.  But that would be a queer thing to do.
No, I think there's some mystery that I haven't gotten to the bottom of
yet.  But I'm going to."

"Good!" exclaimed Mr. Damon.  "I'll help you.  But can you run your
boat back home?"

"Not without fixing it a bit.  I must brace up that tank and put in a
new high-tension wire from the spark coil.  I can do it here, but I'd
rather take it to the shop.  Besides, with two boats to run back, for I
must return Andy's to him, I don't see how I can do it very well unless
you operate one, Mr. Damon."

"Excuse me, but I can't do it.  Bless my slippers, but I would be sure
to run on a rock!  The best plan will be for you to tow your boat and
I'll ride in it and steer.  I can do that much, anyhow.  You can ride
in the RED STREAK."

Tom agreed that this would be a good plan.  So, after temporarily
bracing up the tank in the ARROW, it was shoved out into the lake and
attached to Andy's craft.

"But aren't you going to make a search for those men?" asked Mr. Damon
when Tom was ready to start back.

"No, I think it would be useless.  They are well away by this time, and
I don't fancy chasing them through the woods, especially as night is
coming on.  Besides, I won't leave these boats."

"No doubt you are right, but I would like to see them punished, and I
am curious enough to wish to know what object that scoundrel could have
in ripping out the blocks that served as a brace for the tank."

"I feel the same way myself," commented the lad, "especially since this
is the second time that's happened.  But we'll have to wait, I guess."

A little later the start back was made, Mr. Damon steering the ARROW
skillfully enough so that it did not drag on the leading boat, in which
Tom rode.  His course took him not far from the lake sanitarium, where
Mr. Duncan, the hunter, had been brought, and desiring to know how the
wounded man was getting on, the youth proposed that they make a halt,
explaining to Mr. Damon his reason.

"Yes, and while you're about it you'd better telephone your father that
you will join him to-morrow," suggested the other.  "I know what it is
to fret and worry.  You can fix your boat up in time to go to Sandport
to-morrow, can't you?"

"Yes, I'm glad you reminded me of it.  I'll telephone from the
sanitarium, if they'll let me."

Mr. Duncan was not at the institution, Tom was told, his injury having
healed sufficiently to allow of his being removed to his home.  The
youth readily secured permission to use the telephone, and was soon in
communication with Mr. Swift.  While not telling him all the
occurrences that had delayed him, Tom gave his father and Ned Newton
enough information to explain his absence.  Then the trip to Shopton
was resumed in the two boats.

"What are you going to do about your automobile?" asked Tom as they
neared the point where the machine had been left.

"Never mind about that," replied Mr. Damon.  "It will do it good to
have a night's vacation.  I will go on to your house with you, and
perhaps I can get a train back to my friend's home, so that I can claim
my car."

"Won't you stay all night with me?" invited the young inventor.  "I'd
be glad to have you."

Mr. Damon agreed, and, Tom putting more speed on the RED STREAK, was
soon opposite his own dock.  The ARROW was run in the boathouse and the
owner hastily told Mrs. Baggert and the engineer what had occurred.
Then he took Andy's boat to Mr. Foger's dock and warmly thanked the
red-haired lad for the use of his craft.

"Did you find your boat?" asked Andy eagerly.  "How did the RED STREAK
run?"

"I got my boat and yours runs fine," explained Tom.

"Good!  I'll race you again some day," declared Andy.

Mr. Damon enjoyed his visit at our hero's house, for Mrs. Baggert
cooked one of her best suppers for him.  Tom and the engineer spent the
evening repairing the motor-boat, Mr. Damon looking on and exclaiming
"Bless my shoe leather" or some other part of his dress or anatomy at
every stage of the work.  The engineer wanted to know all about the men
and their doings, but he could supply no reason for their queer actions
regarding the braces under the gasoline tank.

In the morning Tom once more prepared for an early start for Sandport,
and Mr. Damon, reconsidering his plans, rode as far with him as the
place where the automobile had been left.  There he took leave of the
young inventor, promising to call on Mr. Swift in the near future.

"I hope you arrive at the hotel where your father is without any more
accidents," remarked the automobilist.  "Bless my very existence, but
you seem to have the most remarkable series of adventures I ever heard
of!"

"They are rather odd," admitted Tom.  "I don't know that I particularly
care for them, either.  But, now that I have my boat back, I guess
everything will be all right."

But Tom could not look ahead.  He was destined to have still more
exciting times, as presently will be related.

Without further incident he arrived at the Lakeview Hotel in Sandport
that evening and found his father and Ned very glad to see him.  Of
course he had to explain everything then, and, with his son safely in
his sight, Mr. Swift was not so nervous over the recital as he would
have been had Tom not been present.

"Now for some nice, quiet trips," remarked the lad when he had finished
his account.  "I feel as if I had cheated you out of part of your
vacation, Ned, staying away as long as I did."

"Well, of course we missed you," answered his chum.  "But your father
and I had a good time."

"Yes, and I invented a new attachment for a kitchen boiler," added Mr.
Swift.  "I had a chance for it when I passed through the hotel kitchen
one day, for I wanted to see what kind of a range they used."

"I guess there's no stopping you from inventing," replied his son with
a laugh and a hopeless shake of the head.  "But don't let it happen
again when you go away to rest."

"Oh, I only just thought of it," said Mr. Swift.  "I haven't worked the
details out yet."

Then he wanted to know about everything at home and he seemed
particularly anxious lest the Happy Harry gang do some damage.

"I don't believe they will," Tom assured him.  "Garret and Mrs. Baggert
will be on guard."

The next few days were pleasant ones for Tom, his father and Ned
Newton.  They cruised about the lake, went fishing and camped in the
woods.  Even Mr. Swift spent one night in the tent and said he liked it
very much.  For a week the three led an ideal existence, going about as
they pleased, Ned taking a number of photographs with his new camera.
The ARROW proved herself a fine boat, and Tom and Ned, when Mr. Swift
did not accompany them, explored the seldom visited parts of Lake
Carlopa.

The three had been out one day and were discussing the necessity of
returning home soon when Ned spoke.

"I shall hate to give up this life and go to slaving in the bank
again," he complained.  "I wish I was an inventor."

"Oh, we inventors don't have such an easy time," said Mr. Swift.  "You
never know when trouble is coming," and he little imagined how near the
truth he was.

A little later they were at the hotel dock.  When Tom had tied up his
boat the three walked up the path to the broad veranda that faced the
lake.  A boy in uniform met them.

"Some one has just called you on the telephone, Mr. Swift," he reported.

"Some one wants me?  Who is it?"

"I think he said his name is Jackson, sir, Garret Jackson, and he says
the message is very important."

"Tom, something has happened at home!" exclaimed the inventor as he
hurried up the steps.  "I'm afraid there's bad news."

Unable to still the fear in his heart, Tom followed his father.




CHAPTER XX

NEWS OF A ROBBERY


With a hand that trembled so he could scarcely hold the receiver of the
telephone, Mr. Swift placed it to his ear.

"Hello! Hello!" he cried into the transmitter.  "Yes, this is Mr.
Swift--yes, Garret.  What is it?"

Then came a series of clicks, which Tom and Ned listened to.  The
inventor spoke again.

"What's that?  The same men?  Broke in early this evening?  Oh, that's
too bad!  Of course, I'll come at once."

There followed more meaningless clicks, which Tom wished he could
translate.  His father hung up the receiver, turned to him and
exclaimed:

"I've been robbed again!"

"Robbed again!  How, dad?"

"By that same rascally gang, Garret thinks.  This evening, when he and
Mrs. Baggert were in the house the burglar alarm went off.  The
indicator showed that the electrical shop had been entered, and the
engineer hurried there.  He saw a light inside and the shadows of
persons on the windows.  Before he could reach the shop, however, the
thieves heard him coming and escaped.  Oh, Tom, I should never have
come away!"

"But did they take anything, dad?  Perhaps Garret frightened them away
before they had a chance to steal any of your things.  Did you ask him
that?"

"I didn't need to.  He said he made a hasty exanimation before he
called me up, and he is sure a number of my electrical inventions are
missing.  Some of them are devices I never have had patented, and if I
lose them I will have no recovery."

"But just what ones are they?  Perhaps we can send out a police alarm
to-night."

"Garret couldn't tell that," answered Mr. Swift as he paced to and fro
in the hotel office.  "He doesn't know all the tools and machinery I
had in there.  But it is certain that some of my most valuable things
have been taken."

"Never mind.  Don't worry, dad," and Tom tried to speak soothingly, for
he saw that his father was much excited.  "We may be able to get them
back.  How does Garret know the same men who stole the turbine model
broke in the shop this evening?"

"He saw them.  One was Happy Harry, he is positive.  The others he did
not know, but he recognized the tramp from our description of him."

"Then we must tell the police at once."

"Yes, Tom, I wish you would telephone.  I'll give you a description of
the things.  No, I can't do that either, for I don't know what was
stolen.  I must go home at once to find out.  It's a good thing the
motor-boat is here.  Come, let's start at once.  What is my bill here?"
and the inventor turned to the hotel proprietor, who had come into the
office.  "I have suffered a severe loss and must leave at once."

"I am very sorry, sir.  I'll have it ready for you in a few minutes."

"All right.  Tom, is your boat ready for a quick trip?"

"Yes, dad, but I don't like to make it at night with three in.  Of
course it might be perfectly safe, but there's a risk, and I don't like
to take it."

"Don't worry about the risk on my account, Tom.  I'm not afraid.  I
must get home and see of what I have been robbed."

The young inventor was in a quandary.  He wanted to do as his father
requested and to aid him all he could, yet he knew that an all-night
trip in the boat down the lake would be dangerous, not only from the
chance of running on an unknown shore or into a hidden rock, but
because Mr. Swift was not physically fitted to stand the journey.

"Come, Tom," exclaimed the aged inventor impatiently, "we must start at
once!"

"Won't morning do as well, dad?"

"No, I must start now.  I could not sleep worrying over what has
happened.  We will start--"

At that instant there came a low, rumbling peal of thunder.  Mr. Swift
started and peered from a window.  There came a flash of lightning and
another vibrant report from the storm-charged clouds.

"There is your bill, Mr. Swift," remarked the proprietor, coming up,
"but I would not advise you to start to-night.  There is a bad storm in
the west, and it will reach here in a few minutes.  Storms on Lake
Carlopa, especially at this open and exposed end, are not to be
despised, I assure you."

"But I must get home!" insisted Tom's father.

The lace curtain over the window blew almost straight out with a sudden
breeze, and a flash of lightning so bright that it reflected even in
the room where the incandescent electrics were glowing made several
others jump.  Then came a mighty crash, and with that the flood-gates
of the storm were opened, and the rain came down in torrents.  Tom
actually breathed a sigh of relief.  The problem was solved for him.
It would be impossible to start to-night, and he was glad of it, much
as he wanted to get on the trail of the thieves.

There was a scurrying on the part of the hotel attendants to close the
windows, and the guests who had been enjoying the air out on the
porches came running in.  With a rush, a roar and a muttering, as peal
after peal of thunder sounded, the deluge continued.

"It's a good thing we didn't start," observed Ned.

"I should say so," agreed Tom.  "But we'll get off the first thing in
the morning, dad."

Mr. Swift did not reply, but his nervous pacing to and fro in the hotel
office showed how anxious he was to be at home again.  There was no
help for it, however, and, after a time, finding that to think of
reaching his house that night was out of the question, the inventor
calmed down somewhat.

The storm continued nearly all night, as Tom could bear witness, for he
did not sleep well, nor did his father.  And when he came down to
breakfast in the morning Mr. Swift plainly showed the effects of the
bad news.  His face was haggard and drawn and his eyes smarted and
burned from lack of sleep.

"Well, Tom, we must start early," he said nervously.  "I am glad it has
cleared off.  Is the boat all ready?"

"Yes, and it's a good thing it was under shelter last night or we'd
have to bail it out now, and that would delay us."

An hour later they were under way, having telephoned to the engineer at
the Swift home that they were coming.  Garret Jackson reported over the
wire that he had notified the Shopton police of the robbery, but that
little could be done until the inventor arrived to give a description
of the stolen articles.

"And that will do little good, I fear," remarked Tom.  "Those fellows
have evidently been planning this for some time and will cover their
tracks well.  I'd like to catch them, not only to recover your things,
dad, but to find out the mystery of my boat and why the man took the
tank braces."




CHAPTER XXI

THE BALLOON ON FIRE


Down Lake Carlopa speeded the ARROW, those on board watching the banks
slip past as the motor-boat rapidly cut through the water.

"What time do you think we ought to reach home, Tom?" asked Mr. Swift.

"Oh, about four o'clock, if we don't stop for lunch."

"Then we'll not stop," decided the inventor.  "We'll eat what we have
on board.  I suppose you have some rations?" and he smiled, the first
time since hearing the bad news.

"Oh, yes, Ned and I didn't eat everything on our camping trips," and
Tom was glad to note that the fine weather which followed the storm was
having a good effect on his father.

"We certainly had a good time," remarked Ned.  "I don't know when I've
enjoyed a vacation so."

"It's too bad it had to be cut short by this robbery," commented Mr.
Swift.

"Oh, well, my time would be up in a few days more," went on the young
bank employee.  "It's just as well to start back now."

Tom took the shortest route he knew, keeping in as close to shore as he
dared, for now he was as anxious to get home as was his father.  On and
on speeded the ARROW, yet fast as it was, it seemed slow to Mr. Swift,
who, like all nervous persons, always wanted to go wherever he desired
to go instantly.

Tom headed his boat around a little point of land, and was urging the
engine to the top notch of speed, for now he was on a clear course,
with no danger from shoals or hidden rocks, when he saw, darting out
from shore, a tiny craft which somehow seemed familiar to him.  He
recognized a peculiar put-putter of the motor.

"That's the DOT," he remarked in a low voice to Ned, "Miss Nestor's
cousin's boat."

"Is she in it now?" asked Ned.

"Yes," answered Tom quickly.

"You've got good eyesight," remarked Ned dryly, "to tell a girl at that
distance.  It looks to me like a boy."

"No, it's Mary--I mean Miss Nestor," the youth quickly corrected
himself, and a close observer would have noticed that he blushed a bit
under his coat of tan.

Ned laughed, Tom blushed still more, and Mr. Swift, who was in a stern
seat, glanced up quickly.

"It looks as if that boat wanted to hail us," the inventor remarked.

Tom was thinking the same thing, for, though he had changed his course
slightly since sighting the DOT, the little craft was put over so as to
meet him.  Wondering what Miss Nestor could want, but being only too
willing to have a chat with her, the young inventor shifted his helm.
In a short time the two craft were within hailing distance.

"How do you do?" called Miss Nestor, as she slowed down her motor.
"Don't you think I'm improving, Mr. Swift?"

"What's that?  I--er--I beg your pardon, but I didn't catch that,"
exclaimed the aged inventor quickly, coming out of a sort of day-dream.
"I beg your pardon."  He thought she had addressed him.

Miss Nestor blushed and looked questioningly at Tom.

"My father," he explained as he introduced his parent.  Ned needed
none, having met Miss Nestor before.  "Indeed you have improved very
much," went on our hero.  "You seem able to manage the boat all alone."

"Yes, I'm doing pretty well.  Dick lets me take the DOT whenever I want
to, and I thought I'd come out for a little trial run this morning.
I'm getting ready for the races.  I suppose you are going to enter
them?" and she steered her boat alongside Tom's, who throttled down his
powerful motor so as not to pass his friend.

"Races?  I hadn't heard of them," he replied.

"Oh, indeed there are to be fine ones under the auspices of the Lanton
Motor Club.  Mr. Hastings, of whom you bought that boat, is going to
enter his new CARLOPA, and Dick has entered the DOT, in the baby class
of course.  But I'm going to run it, and that's why I'm practicing."

"I hope you win," remarked Tom.  "I hadn't heard of the races, but I
think I'll enter.  I'm glad you told me.  Do you want to race now?" and
he laughed as he looked into the brown eyes of Mary Nestor.

"No, indeed, unless you give me a start of several miles."

They kept together for some little time longer, and then, as Tom knew
his father would be restless at the slow speed, he told Miss Nestor the
need of haste, and, advancing his timer, he soon left the DOT behind.
The girl called a laughing good-by and urged him not to forget the
races, which were to take place in about two weeks.

"I suppose Andy Foger will enter his boat," commented Ned.

"Naturally," agreed Tom.  "It's a racer, and he'll probably think it
can beat anything on the lake.  But if he doesn't manage his motor
differently, it won't."

The distance from Sandport to Shopton had been more than half covered
at noon, when the travelers ate a lunch in the boat.  Mr. Swift was
looking anxiously ahead to catch the first glimpse of his dock and Tom
was adjusting the machinery as finely as he dared to get out of it the
maximum speed.

Ned Newton, who happened to be gazing aloft, wondering at the perfect
beauty of the blue sky after the storm, uttered a sudden exclamation.
Then he arose and pointed at some object in the air.

"Look!" he cried, "A balloon!  It must have gone up from some fair."

Tom and his father looked upward.  High in the air, almost over their
heads, was an immense balloon.  It was of the hot-air variety, such as
performers use in which to make ascensions from fair grounds and
circuses, and below it dangled a trapeze, upon which could be observed
a man, only he looked more like a doll than a human being.

"I shouldn't like to be as high as that," remarked Ned.

"I would," answered Tom as he slowed down the engine the better to
watch the balloon.  "I'd like to go up in an airship, and I intend to
some day."

"I believe he's going to jump!" suddenly exclaimed Ned after a few
minutes.  "He's going to do something, anyhow."

"Probably come down in a parachute," said Tom.  "They generally do
that."

"No!  No!" cried Ned.  "He isn't going to jump.  Something has
happened!  The balloon is on fire!  He'll be burned to death!"

Horror stricken, they all gazed aloft.  From the mouth of the balloon
there shot a tongue of fire, and it was followed by a cloud of black
smoke.  The big bag was getting smaller and seemed to be descending,
while the man on the trapeze was hanging downward by his hands to get
as far as possible away from the terrible heat.




CHAPTER XXII

THE RESCUE


"Jump!  Jump!" cried Mr. Swift, leaping to his feet and motioning to
the man on the trapeze of the balloon.  But it is doubtful whether or
not the performer heard him.  Certainly he could not see the frantic
motions of the inventor.  "Why doesn't he jump?" Mr. Swift went on
piteously to the two lads.  "He'll surely be burned to death if he
hangs on there!"

"It's too far to leap!" exclaimed Tom.  "He's a good way up in the air,
though it looks like only a short distance.  He would be killed if he
dropped now."

"He ought to have a parachute," added Ned.  "Most of those men do when
they go up in a balloon.  Why doesn't he come down in that?  I wonder
how the balloon took fire?"

"Maybe he hasn't a parachute," suggested Tom, while he slowed down the
motor-boat still more so as to remain very nearly under the blazing
balloon.

"Yes, he has!" cried Ned.  "See, it's hanging to one side of the big
bag.  He ought to cut loose.  He could save himself then.  Why doesn't
he?"

The balloon was slowly twisting about, gradually settling to the
surface of the lake, but all the while the flames were becoming fiercer
and the black clouds of smoke increased in size.

"There, see the parachute!" went on Ned.

The twisting of the bag had brought into view the parachute or big,
umbrella-shaped bag, which would have enabled the man to safely drop to
the surface of the lake.  Without it he would have hit the water with
such force that he would have been killed as surely as if he had struck
the solid earth.  But the boys and Mr. Swift also saw something else,
and this was that the balloon was on fire on the same side where the
parachute was suspended.

"Look! Look!" shouted Tom, bringing his boat to a stop.  "That's why he
can't jump!  He can't reach the parachute!"

By this time the balloon had settled so low that the actions of the man
could be plainly seen. That he was in great agony of fear, as well as
in great pain from the terrific heat over his head was evident. He
shifted about on the trapeze bar, now hanging by one hand, so as to
bring his body a little farther below the blazing end of the bag, then,
when one arm tired, he would hang by the other. If the balloon would
only come down more quickly it would get to within such a short
distance of the water that the man could safely make the drop. But the
immense canvas bag was settling so slowly, for it was still very
buoyant, that considerable time must elapse before it would be near
enough to the water to make it safe for the unfortunate man to let go
the trapeze.

"Oh, if we could only do something!" cried Tom.  "We have to remain
here helpless and watch him burn to death.  It's awful!"

The three in the boat continued to gaze upward.  They could see the man
making frantic efforts to reach his parachute from time to time.  Once,
as a little current of air blew the flames and smoke to one side, he
thought he had a chance.  Up on the trapeze bar he pulled himself and
then edged along it in an endeavor to grasp the ring of the parachute.
Once he almost had hold of that and also the cord, which ran to a knife
blade.  This cord, being pulled, would sever the rope that bound it to
the balloon, and he would be comparatively safe, so he might drop to
the lake.  But, just as he was about to grasp the ring and cord the
smoke came swirling down on him and the hungry flames seemed to put out
their fiery tongues to devour him.  He had to slide back and once more
hung by his hands.

"I thought he was saved then," whispered Tom, and even the whisper
sounded loud in the silence.

Several men came running along the shore of the lake now.  They saw the
occupants in the ARROW and cried out:

"Why don't you save him?  Go to his rescue!"

"What can we do?" asked Ned quietly of his two friends, but he did not
trouble to answer the men on shore, who probably did not know what they
were saying.

The motor-boat had drifted from a spot under the unfortunate
balloonist, and at a word from his father the young inventor started
the engine and steered the craft back directly under the blazing bag
again.

"If he does drop, perhaps we may be able to pick him up," said Mr.
Swift.  "I wish we could save him!"

A cry from Ned startled Tom and his father, and their eyes, that had
momentarily been directed away from the burning bag high in the air,
were again turned toward it.

"The balloon is falling apart!" exclaimed Ned.  "It's all up with him
now!"

Indeed it did seem so, for pieces of the burning canvas, blazing and
smoking, were falling in a shower from the part of the bag already
consumed, and the fiery particles were fairly raining down on the man.
But he still had his wits about him, though his perilous position was
enough to make any one lose his mind, and he swung from side to side on
the bar, shifting skillfully with his hands and dodging the larger
particles of blazing canvas.  When some small sparks fell on his
clothing he beat them out with one hand, while with the other he clung
to the trapeze.

There was scarcely any wind or the man's plight might have been more
bearable, for the current of air would have carried the smoke and fire
to one side.  As it was, most of the smoke and flames went straight up,
save now and then, when a draught created by the heat would swirl the
black clouds down on the performer, hiding him from sight for a second
or two.  A breeze would have carried the sparks away instead of letting
them fall on him.

Nearer and nearer to the surface of the lake sank the balloon.  By this
time the crowd on the bank had increased and there were excited
opinions as to what was best to do.  But the trouble was that little
could be done.  If the man could hold out until he got near enough to
the water to let go he might yet be saved, but this would not be for
some time at the present rate the balloon was falling.  The performer
realized this, and, as the fire was getting hotter, he made another
desperate attempt to reach the parachute.  It was unavailing and he had
to drop back, hanging below the slender bar.

Suddenly there came a puff of wind, fanning the faces of those in the
motor-boat, and they looked intently to observe if there was any
current as high as was the balloonist.  They saw the big bag sway to
one side and the flames broke out more fiercely as they caught the
draught.  The balloon moved slowly down the lake.

"Keep after it, Tom!" urged his father.  "We may be able to save him!"

The lad increased the speed of his engine and Ned, who was at the
wheel, gave it a little twist.  Then, with a suddenness that was
startling, the blazing canvas airship began to settle swiftly toward
the water.  It had lost much of its buoyancy.

"Now he can jump!  He's near enough to the water now!" cried Tom.

But a new danger arose.  True, the balloon was rapidly approaching the
surface of the lake and in a few seconds more would be within such a
short distance that a leap would not be fatal.  But the burning bag was
coming straight down and scarcely would the man be in the water ere the
fiery canvas mass would be on top of him.

In such an event he would either be burned to death or so held down
that drowning must quickly follow.

"If there was only wind enough to carry the balloon beyond him after he
jumped he could do it safely!" cried Ned.

Tom said nothing.  He was measuring, with, his eye, the distance the
balloon had yet to go and also the distance away the motor-boat was
from where it would probably land.

"He can do it!" exclaimed the young inventor.

"How?" asked his father.

For answer Tom caught up a newspaper he had purchased at the hotel that
morning.  Rolling it quickly into a cone, so that it formed a rough
megaphone, he put the smaller end to his mouth, and, pointing the
larger opening at the balloonist, he called out:

"Drop into the lake!  We'll pick you up before the bag falls on you!
Jump!  Let go now!"

The balloonist heard and understood.  So did Ned and Mr. Swift.  Tom's
quick wit had found a way to save the man.

Faster and faster the blazing bag settled toward the surface of the
water.  It was now merely a mushroom-shaped piece of burning and
smoking canvas, yet it was supporting the man almost as a parachute
would have done.

With one look upward to the burning mass above him and a glance
downward to the lake, the aeronaut let go his hold.  Like a shot he
came down, holding his body rigid and straight as a stick, for he knew
how to fall into water, did that balloonist.

Tom Swift was ready for him.  No sooner had the lad called his
directions through the megaphone than the young inventor had speeded up
his engine to the top notch.

"Steer so as to pick him up!" Tom cried to Ned, who was at the wheel.
"Pass by him on a curve, and, as soon as I grab him, put the wheel over
so as to get out from under the balloon."

It was a risky thing to do, but our hero had it all planned out.  He
made a loop of the boat's painter, and, hurrying to the bow, leaned
over as far as he could, holding the rope in readiness.  His idea was
to have the balloonist grab the strands and be pulled out of danger by
the speedy motor-boat, for the blazing canvas would cover such an
extent of water that the man could not have swum out of the danger zone
in time.

Down shot the balloonist and down more slowly settled the collapsed
bag, yet not so slowly that there was any time to spare.  It needed
only a few seconds to drop over the performer, to burn and smother him.

Into the water splashed the man, disappearing from sight as when a
stick is dropped in, point first.  Ned was alert and steered the boat
to the side in which the man's face was, for he concluded that the
aeronaut would strike out in that direction when he came up.  The ARROW
was now directly under the blazing balloon and cries of fear from the
watchers on shore urged upon Tom and his companions the danger of their
position.  But they had to take some risk to rescue the man.

"There he is!" cried Mr. Swift, who was on the watch, leaning over the
side of the boat.  Tom and Ned saw him at the same instant.  Ned
shifted his wheel and the young inventor bent over, holding out the
rope for the man to grasp.  He saw it and struck out toward the ARROW.
But there was no need for him to go far.  An instant more and the
speeding motor-boat shot past him.  He grabbed the rope and Tom, aided
by Mr. Swift, began to lift him out of the water.

"Quick!  To one side, Ned!" yelled Tom, for the heat of the descending
mass of burning canvas struck him like a furnace blast.

Ned needed no urging.  With a swirl of the screw the ARROW shot herself
out of the way, carrying the aeronaut with her.  A moment later the
burning balloon, or what there was left of it, settled down into the
lake, hissing angrily as the fire was quenched by the water and
completely covering the spot where, but a few seconds before, the man
had been swimming.  He had been saved in the nick of time.




CHAPTER XXIII

PLANS FOR AN AIRSHIP


"Slow her down, Ned!" cried Tom, for the ARROW was shooting so swiftly
through the water that the young inventor found it impossible to pull
up the balloonist.  Ned hurried back to the motor, and, when the boat's
way had been checked, it was an easy matter to pull the dripping and
almost exhausted man into the craft.

"Are you much hurt?" asked Mr. Swift anxiously, for Tom was too much
out of breath with his exertion to ask any questions.  For that matter
the man was in almost as bad a plight.  He was breathing heavily, as
one who had run a long race.

"I--I guess I'm all right," he panted.  "Only burned a little on my
hands.  That--that was a close call!"

The boat swung around and headed for shore, on which was quite a throng
of persons.  Some of them had cheered when they saw the plucky rescue.

"I'm afraid we can't save your balloon," gasped Tom as he looked at the
place where the canvas was still floating and burning.

"No matter.  It wasn't worth much.  That's the last time I'll ever go
up in a hot-air balloon," said the man with more energy than he had
before exhibited.  "I'm done with 'em.  I've had my lesson.  Hereafter
an aeroplane or a gas balloon for me.  I only did this to oblige the
fair committee.  I'll not do it again."

The man spoke in short, crisp sentences, as though he was in too much
of a hurry to waste his words.

"Let it sink," he went on.  "It's no good.  Glad to see the last of it."

Almost as he spoke, with a final hiss and a cloud of steam that mingled
with the black smoke, the remains of the big bag sunk beneath the
surface of the lake.

"We must get you ashore at once and to a doctor," said Mr. Swift.  "You
must be badly burned."

"Not much.  Only my hands, where some burning pieces of canvas fell on'
em.  If I had a little oil to put on I'd be all right."

"I can fix you up better than that," put in Tom.  "I have some
Vaseline."

"Good!  Just the thing.  Pass it over," and the man, though he spoke
shortly, seemed grateful for the offer.  "My name's Sharp," he went on,
"John Sharp, of no place in particular, for I travel all over.  I'm a
professional balloonist.  Ha!  That's the stuff!"

This last was in reference to a bottle of Vaseline, which Tom produced.
Mr. Sharp spread some over the backs of his hands and went on:

"That's better.  Much obliged.  I can't begin to thank you for what you
did for me--saved my life.  I thought it was all up with me--would have
been but for you.  Mustn't mind my manner--it's a way I have--have to
talk quick when you're balloonin'--no time--but I'm grateful all the
same.  Who might you people be?"

Tom told him their names and Mr. Swift asked the aeronaut if he was
sure he didn't need the services of a physician.

"No doctor for me," answered the balloonist.  "I've been in lots of
tight places, but this was the worst squeeze.  If you'll put me ashore,
I guess I can manage now."

"But you're all wet," objected Tom.  "Where will you go?  You need some
other clothes," for the man wore a suit of tights and spangles.

"Oh, I'm used to this," went on the performer.  "I frequently have to
fall in the water.  I always carry a little money with me so as to get
back to the place where I started from.  By the way, where am I?"

"Opposite Daleton," answered Tom.  "Where did you go up from?"

"Pratonia.  Big fair there.  I was one of the features."

"Then you're about fifteen miles away," commented Mr. Swift.  "You can
hardly get back before night.  Must you go there?"

"Left my clothes there.  Also a valuable gas balloon.  No more hot-air
ones for me.  Guess I'd better go back," and the aeronaut continued to
speak in his quick, jerky sentences.

"We'd be very glad to have you come with us, Mr. Sharp," went on the
inventor.  "We are not far from Shopton, and if you would like to
remain over night I'm sure we would make you comfortable.  You can
proceed to Pratonia in the morning."

"Thanks.  Might not be a bad idea," said Mr. Sharp.  "I'm obliged to
you.  I've got to go there to collect my money, though I suppose they
won't give it all to me."

"Why not?" demanded Ned.

"Didn't drop from my parachute.  Couldn't.  Fire was one
reason--couldn't reach the parachute, and if I could have, guess it
wouldn't have been safe.  Parachute probably was burned too.  But I'm
done with hot-air balloons though I guess I said that before."

The boys were much interested in the somewhat odd performer, and, on
his part, he seemed to take quite a notion to Tom, who told him of
several things that he had invented. "Well," remarked Mr. Swift after a
while, during which the boat had been moving slowly down the lake, "if
we are not to go ashore for a doctor for you, Mr. Sharp, suppose we put
on more speed and get to my home? I'm anxious about a robbery that
occurred there," and he related some facts in the case.

"Speed her up!" exclaimed Mr. Sharp.  "Wish I could help you catch the
scoundrels, but afraid I can't--hands too sore," and he looked at his
burns.  Then he told how he had made the ascension from the Pratonia
fair grounds and how, when he was high in the air, he had discovered
that the balloon was on fire.  He described his sensations and told how
he thought his time had surely come.  Sparks from the hot air used to
inflate it probably caused the blaze, he said.

"I've made a number of trips," he concluded, "hot air and gas bags, but
this was the worst ever.  It got on my nerves for a few minutes," he
added coolly.

"I should think it would," agreed Tom as he speeded up the motor and
sent the ARROW on her homeward way.

The boys and Mr. Swift were much interested in the experiences of the
balloonist and asked him many questions, which he answered modestly.
Several hours passed and late that afternoon the party approached
Shopton.

"Here we are!" exclaimed Mr. Swift, relief in his tones.  "Now to see
of what I have been robbed and to get the police after the scoundrels!"

When the boat was nearing the dock Mr. Sharp, who had been silent for
some time, suddenly turned to Tom and asked:

"Ever invent an airship?"

"No," replied the lad, somewhat surprised.  "I never did."

"I have," went on the balloonist.  "That is, I've invented part of it.
I'm stuck over some details.  Maybe you and I'll finish it some day.
How about it?"

"Maybe," assented Tom, who was occupied just then in making a good
landing.  "I am interested in airships, but I never thought I could
build one."

"Easiest thing in the world," went on Mr. Sharp, as if it was an
everyday matter.  "You and I will get busy as soon as we clear up this
robbery."  He talked as though he had been a friend of the family for
some time, for he had a genial, taking manner.

A little later Mr. Swift was excitedly questioning Garret Jackson
concerning the robbery and making an examination of the electrical shop
to discover what was missing.

"They've taken some parts of my gyroscope!" he exclaimed, "and some
valuable tools and papers, as well as some unfinished work that will be
difficult to replace."

"Much of a loss?" asked Mr. Sharp with a business-like air.

"Well, not so large as regards money," answered the inventor, "but they
took things I can never replace, and I will miss them very much if I
cannot get them back."

"Then we'll get them back!" snapped the balloonist, as if that was all
there was to it.

The police were called up on the telephone and the facts given to them,
as well as a description of the stolen things.  They promised to do
what they could, but, in the light of past experiences, Tom and his
father did not think this would be much.  There was little more that
could be done that evening.  Ned Newton went to his home, and, after
Mr. Swift had insisted in calling in his physician to look after Mr.
Sharp's burns the balloonist was given a room next to Tom's.  Then the
Swift household settled down.

"Well," remarked Tom to his father, as he got ready for bed, "this sure
has been an exciting day."

"And my loss is a serious one," added the inventor somewhat sadly.

"Don't worry, dad," begged his son.  "I'll do my best to recover those
things for you."

Several days passed, but there was no clew to the thieves.  That they
were the same ones who had stolen the turbine model there was little
doubt, but they seemed to have covered their tracks well.  The police
were at a loss, and, though Tom and Mr. Sharp cruised about the lake,
they could get no trace of the men.  The balloonist had sent to
Pratonia for his clothing and other baggage and was now installed in
the Swift home, where he was invited to stay a week or two.

One night when he was looking over some papers he had taken from his
trunk the balloonist came over to where Tom was making a drawing of a
new machine he was planning and said:

"Like to see my idea for an airship?  Different from some.  It's a
dirigible balloon with an aeroplane front and rear to steer and balance
it in big winds.  It would be a winner, only for one thing.  Maybe you
can help me."

"Maybe I can," agreed Tom, who was at once interested.

"We ought to be able to do something.  Look at our names--Swift and
Sharp--quick and penetrating--a good firm to build airships," and he
laughed genially.  "Shall we do it?"

"I'm willing," agreed Tom, and the balloonist spread his plans out on
the table, he and the young inventor soon being deep in a discussion of
them.




CHAPTER XXIV

THE MYSTERY SOLVED


From then on, for several days, the young inventor and his new friend
lived in an atmosphere of airships.  They talked them from morning
until night, and even Mr. Swift, much as he was exercised over his
loss, took part in the discussions.

In the meanwhile efforts had not ceased to locate the robbers and
recover the stolen goods, but so far without success.

One afternoon, about two weeks after the thrilling rescue of John
Sharp, Tom said to the balloonist:

"Wouldn't you like to come for a ride in the motor-boat?  Maybe it will
help us to solve the puzzle of the airship.  We'll take a trip across
and up the opposite shore."

"Good idea," commented Mr. Sharp.  "Fine day for a sail.  Come on.
Blow the cobwebs from our brains."

Mr. Swift declined an invitation to accompany them, as he said he would
stay home and try to straighten out his affairs, which were somewhat
muddled by the robbery.

Out over the blue waters of Lake Carlopa shot the ARROW.  It was making
only moderate speed, as Tom was in no hurry, and he knew his engine
would last longer if not forced too frequently.  They glided along,
crossed the lake and were proceeding up the opposite shore when, as
they turned out from a little bay and rounded a point of land, Mr.
Sharp exclaimed:

"Look out, Tom, there's rowboat just ahead!"

"Oh, I'll pass well to one side of that," answered the young inventor,
looking at the craft.  As he did so, noting that there were four men in
it, one of the occupants caught a glimpse of the ARROW.  No sooner had
he done so than he spoke to his companions, and they all turned to
stare at Tom.  At first the lad could scarcely believe his eyes, but as
he looked more intently he uttered a cry.

"There they are!"

"Who?" inquired Mr. Sharp.

"Those men--the thieves!  We must catch them!"

Tom had spoken loudly, but even though the men in the rowboat did hear
what he said, they would have realized without that that they were
about to be pursued, for there was no mistaking the attitude of our
hero.

Two of the thieves were at the oars, and, with one accord, they at once
increased their speed.  The boat swung about sharply and was headed for
the shore, which they seemed to have come from only a short time
previous, as the craft was not far out in the lake.

"No, you don't!" cried Tom. "I see your game!  You want to get to the
woods, where you'll have a better chance to escape!  If this isn't
great luck, coming upon them this way!"

It was the work of but a moment to speed up the engine and head the
ARROW for the rowboat.  The men were pulling frantically, but they had
no chance.

"Get between them and the shore!" cried Mr. Sharp. "You can head them
off then." This was good advice and Tom followed it. The men, among
whom the lad could recognize Happy Harry and Anson Morse, were all
excited. Two of them stood up, as though to jump overboard, but their
companions called to them to stop.

"If we only had a gun now, not to shoot at them but to intimidate
them," murmured the balloonist, "maybe they'd stop."

"Here's one," answered Tom, pointing to the seat locker, where he kept
the shotgun Mr. Duncan had given him.  In a moment Mr. Sharp had it out.

"Surrender!" he cried, pointing the weapon at the men in the small boat.

"Don't shoot!  Don't fire on us!  We'll give up!" cried Happy Harry,
and the two with the oars ceased pulling.

"Don't take any chances," urged Mr. Sharp in a low voice.  "Keep
between them and the shore.  I'll cover them."  Tom was steering from
an auxiliary side wheel near the motor, and soon the ARROW had cut off
the retreat of the men.  They could not land and to row across the lake
meant speedy capture.

"Well, what do you want of us?" growled Morse.  "What right have you
got to interfere with us in this fashion?"

"The best of right," answered Tom.  "You'll find out when you're landed
in jail."

"You can't arrest us," sneered Happy Harry.  "You're not an officer and
you haven't any warrant."

Tom hadn't thought of that, and his chagrin showed in his face.  Happy
Harry was quick to see it.

"You'd better let us go," he threatened "We can have you arrested for
bothering us.  You haven't any right to stop us, Tom Swift."

"Maybe he hasn't, but I have!" exclaimed John Sharp suddenly.

"You!  Who are you?" demanded Featherton, alias Simpson, the man who
had run the automobile that carried Tom away.

"Me.  I'm a special deputy sheriff for this county," answered the
balloonist simply.  "Here's my badge," and, throwing back his coat, he
displayed it.  "You see I got the appointment in order to have some
authority in the crowds that gather to watch me go up," he explained to
Tom, who plainly showed his astonishment.  "I found it very useful to
be able to threaten arrest, but in this case I'll do more than
threaten.  You are my prisoners," he went on to the men in the boat,
and he handled the shotgun as if he knew how to use it.  "I'll take you
into custody on complaint of Mr. Swift for robbery.  Now will you go
quietly or are you going to make a fuss?" and Mr. Sharp shut his jaw
grimly.

"Well, seeing as how you have the drop on us, I guess we'll have to do
as you say," admitted Happy Harry, alias Jim Burke.  "But you can't
prove anything against us.  We haven't any of Mr. Swift's property."

"Well, you know where it is then," retorted Tom quickly.

Under the restraining influence of the gun the men made no resistance.
While Mr. Sharp covered them, Tom towed their boat toward shore.  Then,
while the young inventor held the gun, the balloonist tied the hands
and feet of the thieves in a most scientific manner, for what he did
not know about ropes and knots was not worth putting into a book.

"Now, I guess they'll stay quiet for a while," remarked Mr. Sharp as he
surveyed the crestfallen criminals.  "I'll remain on guard here, Tom,
while you go notify the nearest constable and we'll take them to jail.
We bagged the whole lot as neatly as could be desired."

"No, you didn't get all of us!" exclaimed Happy Harry, and there was a
savage anger in his tones.

"Keep quiet!" urged Morse.

"No, I'll not keep quiet!  It's a shame that we have to take our
medicine while that trimmer, Tod Boreck, goes free.  He ought to have
been with us, and he would be, only he's trying to get away with that
sparkler!"

"Keep quiet," again urged Morse.

Tom was all attention.  He had caught the word "sparkler," and he at
once associated it with the occasion he had heard the men use it
before.  He felt that he was on the track of solving the mystery
connected with his boat.

He looked at the men.  They were the same four who had been involved in
the former theft--Appleson, Featherton, Morse and Burke.  Were there
five of them?  He recalled the man who had been caught tampering with
his boat--the man who had tried to bid on the ARROW at the auction.
Where was he?

"Boreck didn't get what he was after," resumed Happy Harry, "and I'm
going to spoil his game for him.  Say, kid," he went on to Tom, "look
in the front part of your boat--where the gasoline tank is."

Tom felt his heart beating fast.  At last he felt that he would solve
the puzzle.  He opened the forward compartment.  To his disappointment
it seemed as usual.  Morse and the others were making a vain effort to
silence Happy Harry.

"I don't see anything here," said Tom.

"No, because it's hidden in one of those blocks of wood you use for a
brace," continued the man.  "Which one it is, Boreck didn't know, so he
pulled out two or three, only to be fooled each time.  You must have
shifted them, kid, from the way they were when we had the boat."

"I did," answered the young inventor, recollecting how he had taken out
some of the braces and inserted new ones, then painted the interior of
the compartment.  "What is in the braces, anyhow?"

"The sparkler--a big diamond--in a hollow place in the wood, kid!"
exclaimed Happy Harry, blurting out the words.  "I'm not going to let
Tod Boreck get away with it while we stay in jail."

"Take out all the braces that haven't been moved and have a look,"
suggested Mr. Sharp.  Tom only had to remove two, those farthest back,
for all the others had, at one time or another, been changed or taken
away by the thief.

One of the blocks did not seem to have anything unusual about it, but
at the sight of the other Tom could not repress a cry.  It was the one
that seemed to have had a hole bored in it and then plugged up again.
He remembered his father noticing it on the occasion of overhauling the
boat.

"The sparkler's in there," said the tramp as he saw the brace.  "Boreck
was after it several times, but he never pulled out the right one."

With his knife Tom dug out the putty that covered the round hole in the
block.  No sooner had he done so than there rolled out into his hand a
white object.  It was something done up in tissue paper, and as he
removed the wrapper, there was a flash in the sunlight and a large,
beautiful diamond was revealed.  The mystery had been solved.




CHAPTER XXV

WINNING A RACE


"Where did this diamond come from?" demanded Mr. Sharp of the quartette
of criminals.

"That's for us to know and you to find out," sneered Happy Harry.  "I
don't care as long as that trimmer Boreck didn't get it.  He tried to
do us out of our share."

"Well, I guess the police will make you tell," went on the balloonist.
"Go for the constable, Tom."

Leaving his friend to guard the ugly men, who for a time at least were
beyond the possibility of doing harm, Tom hurried off through the woods
to the nearest village.  There he found an officer and the gang was
soon lodged in jail.  The diamond was turned over to the authorities,
who said they would soon locate the owner.

Nor were they long in doing it, for it appeared the gem was part of a
large jewel robbery that had taken place some time before in a distant
city.  The Happy Harry gang, as the men came to be called, were
implicated in it, though they got only a small share of the plunder.
Search was made for Tod Boreck and he was captured about a week after
his companions.  Seeing that their game was up, the men made a partial
confession, telling where Mr. Swift's goods had been secreted, and the
inventor's valuable tools, papers and machinery were recovered, no
damage having been done to them.

It developed that after the diamond theft, and when the gang still had
possession of Mr. Hastings' boat, Boreck, sometimes called Murdock by
his cronies, unknown to them, had secreted the jewel in one of the
braces under the gasoline tank.  He expected to get it out secretly,
but the capture of the gang and the sale of the boat prevented this.
Then he tried to buy the craft to take out the diamond, but Tom overbid
him.  It was Boreck who found Andy's bunch of keys and used one to open
the compartment lock when Tom surprised him.  The man did manage to
remove some of the blocks, thinking he had the one with the diamond in
it, but the fact of Tom changing them, and painting the compartment
deceived him.  The gang hoped to get some valuables from Mr. Swift's
shops, and, to a certain extent, succeeded after hanging around for
several nights and following him to Sandport, but Tom eventually proved
too much for them.  Even stealing the Arrow, which was taken to aid the
gang in robbing Mr. Swift, did not succeed, and Boreck's plan then to
get possession of the diamond fell through.

It was thought that the gang would get long terms in prison, but one
night, during a violent storm, they escaped from the local jail and
that was the last seen of them for some time.

A few days after the capture as Tom was in the boathouse making some
minor repairs to the motor he heard a voice calling:

"Mistah Swift, am yo' about?"

"Hello, Rad, is that you?" he inquired, recognizing the voice of the
colored owner of the mule Boomerang.

"Yais, sa, dat's me.  I got a lettah fo' yo'.  I were passin' de
post-office an' de clerk asted me to brung it to yo' 'case as how it's
marked 'hurry,' an' he said he hadn't seen yo' to-day."

"That's right.  I've been so busy I haven't had time to go for the
mail," and Tom took the letter, giving Eradicate ten cents for his
trouble.

"Ha, that's good!" exclaimed Tom as he read it.

"Hab some one done gone an' left yo' a fortune, Mistah Swift?" asked
the negro.

"No, but it's almost as good.  It's an invitation to take part in the
motor-boat races next week.  I'd forgotten all about them.  I must get
ready."

"Good land!  Dat's all de risin' generation t'inks about now," observed
Eradicate, "racin' an' goin' fast.  Mah ole mule Boomerang am good
enough fo' me," and, shaking his head in a woeful manner, Eradicate
went on his way.

Tom told Mr. Sharp and his father of the proposed races of the Lanton
Motor-boat Club, and, as it was required that two persons be in a craft
the size of the ARROW, the young inventor arranged for the balloonist
to accompany him.  Our hero spent the next few days in tuning up his
motor and in getting the ARROW ready for the contest.

The races took place on that side of Lake Carlopa near where Mr.
Hastings lived, and he was one of the officials of the club.  There
were several classes, graded according to the horsepower of the motors,
and Tom found himself in a class with Andy Foger.

"Here's where I beat you," boasted the red-haired youth exultantly,
though his manner toward Tom was more temperate than usual.  Andy had
learned a lesson.

"Well, if you can beat me I'll give you credit for it," answered Tom.

The first race was for high-powered craft, and in this Mr. Hastings'
new CARLOPA won.  Then came the trial of the small boats, and Tom was
pleased to note that Miss Nestor was on hand in the tiny DOT.

"Good luck!" he called to her as he was adjusting his timer, for his
turn would come soon.  "Remember what I told you about the spark," for
he had given her a few lessons.

"If I win it will be due to you," she called brightly.

She did win, coming in ahead of several confident lads who had better
boats.  But Miss Nestor handled the DOT to perfection and crossed the
line a boat's length ahead of her nearest competitor.

"Fine!" cried Tom, and then came the warning gun that told him to get
ready for his trial.

This was a five-mile race and had several entrants.  The affair was a
handicap one and Tom had no reason to complain of the rating allowed
him.

"Crack!" went the starting pistol and away went Tom and one or two
others who had the same allowance as did he.  A little later the others
started and finally the last class, including Andy Foger.  The RED
STREAK shot ahead and was soon in the lead, for Andy and Sam had
learned better how to handle their craft.  Tom and Mr. Sharp were
worried, but they stuck grimly to the race and when the turning stake
was reached Tom's motor had so warmed up and was running so well that
he crept up on Andy.  A mile from the final mark Andy and Tom were on
even terms, and though the red-haired lad tried to shake off his rival
he could not.  Andy's ignition system failed him several times and he
changed from batteries to magneto and back again in the hope of getting
a little more speed out of the motor.

But it was not to be.  A half-mile away from the finish Tom, who had
fallen behind a little, crept up on even terms.  Then he slowly forged
ahead, and, a hundred rods from the stake, the young inventor knew that
the race was his.  He clinched it a few minutes later, crossing the
line amid a burst of cheers.  The ARROW had beaten several boats out of
her own class and Tom was very proud and happy.

"My, but we certainly did scoot along some!" cried Mr. Sharp.  "But
that's nothing to how we'll go when we build our airship, eh, Tom?" and
he looked at the flushed face of the lad.

"No, indeed," agreed the young inventor.  "But I don't know that we'll
take part in any races in it.  We'll build it, however, as soon as we
can solve that one difficulty."

They did solve it, as will be told in the next book of this series, to
be called "Tom Swift and His Airship; or, The Stirring Cruise of the
RED CLOUD."  They had some remarkable adventures in the wonderful
craft, and solved the mystery of a great bank robbery.

This ended the contests of the motor-boats and the little fleet crowded
up to the floats and docks, where the prizes were to be awarded.  Tom
received a handsome silver cup and Miss Nestor a gold bracelet.

"Now I want all the contestants, winners and losers, to come up to my
house and have lunch," invited Mr. Hastings.

As Tom and the balloonist strolled up the walk to the handsome house
Andy Foger passed them.

"You wouldn't have beaten me if my spark coil hadn't gone back on me,"
he said, somewhat sneeringly.

"Maybe," admitted Tom, and just then he caught sight of Mary Nestor.
"May I take you in to lunch?" he asked.

"Yes," she said, "because you helped me to win," and she blushed
prettily.  And then they all sat down to the tables set out on the
lawn, while Tom looked so often at Mary Nestor that Mr. Sharp said
afterward it was a wonder he found time to eat.  But Tom didn't care.
He was happy.

Chapter 1

An Explosion


"Are you all ready, Tom?"

"All ready, Mr. Sharp," replied a young man, who was stationed near
some complicated apparatus, while the questioner, a dark man, with a
nervous manner, leaned over a large tank.

"I'm going to turn on the gas now," went on the man. "Look out for
yourself. I'm not sure what may happen."

"Neither am I, but I'm ready for it. If it does explode it can't do
much damage."

"Oh, I hope it doesn't explode. We've had so much trouble with the
airship, I trust nothing goes wrong now."

"Well, turn on the gas, Mr. Sharp," advised Tom Swift. "I'll watch the
pressure gauge, and, if it goes too high, I'll warn you, and you can
shut it off."

The man nodded, and, with a small wrench in his hand, went to one end
of the tank. The youth, looking anxiously at him, turned his gaze now
and then toward a gauge, somewhat like those on steam boilers, which
gauge was attached to an aluminum, cigar-shaped affair, about five feet
long.

Presently there was a hissing sound in the small frame building where
the two were conducting an experiment which meant much to them. The
hissing grew louder.

"Be ready to jump," advised Mr. Sharp.

"I will," answered the lad. "But the pressure is going up very slowly.
Maybe you'd better turn on more gas."

"I will. Here she goes! Look out now. You can't tell what is going to
happen."

With a sudden hiss, as the powerful gas, under pressure, passed from
the tank, through the pipes, and into the aluminum container, the hand
on the gauge swept past figure after figure on the dial.

"Shut it off!" cried Tom quickly. "It's coming too fast! Shut her off!"

The man sprang to obey the command, and, with nervous fingers, sought
to fit the wrench over the nipple of the controlling valve. Then his
face seemed to turn white with fear.

"I can't move it!" Mr. Sharp yelled. "It's jammed! I can't shut off the
gas! Run! Look out! She'll explode!"

Tom Swift, the young inventor, whose acquaintance some of you have
previously made, gave one look at the gauge, and seeing that the
pressure was steadily mounting, endeavored to reach, and open, a
stop-cock, that he might relieve the strain. One trial showed him that
the valve there had jammed too, and catching up a roll of blue prints
the lad made a dash for the door of the shop. He was not a second
behind his companion, and hardly had they passed out of the structure
before there was a loud explosion which shook the building, and
shattered all the windows in it.

Pieces of wood, bits of metal, and a cloud of sawdust and shavings flew
out of the door after the man and the youth, and this was followed by a
cloud of yellowish smoke.

"Are you hurt, Tom?" cried Mr. Sharp, as he swung around to look back
at the place where the hazardous experiment had been conducted.

"Not a bit! How about you?"

"I'm all right. But it was touch and go! Good thing you had the gauge
on or we'd never have known when to run. Well, we've made another
failure of it," and the man spoke somewhat bitterly.

"Never mind, Mr. Sharp," went on Tom Swift. "I think it will be the
last mistake. I see what the trouble is now; and know how to remedy it.
Come on back, and we'll try it again; that is if the tank hasn't blown
up."

"No, I guess that's all right. It was the aluminum container that went
up, and that's so light it didn't do much damage. But we'd better wait
until some of those fumes escape. They're not healthy to breathe."

The cloud of yellowish smoke was slowly rolling away, and the man and
lad were approaching the shop, which, in spite of the explosion that
had taken place in it, was still intact, when an aged man, coming from
a handsome house not far off, called out, "Tom, is anyone hurt?"

"No, dad. We're all right."

"What happened?"

"Well, we had another explosion. We can't seem to get the right mixture
of the gas, but I think we've had the last of our bad luck.  We're
going to try it again. Up to now the gas has been too strong, the tank
too weak, or else our valve control is bad."

"Oh dear, Mr. Swift! Do tell them to be careful!" a woman's voice
chimed in. "I'm sure something dreadful will happen! This is about the
tenth time something has blown up around here, and--"

"It's only the ninth, Mrs. Baggert," interrupted Tom, somewhat
indignantly.

"Well, goodness me! Isn't nine almost as bad as ten? There I was, just
putting my bread in the oven," went on Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper,
"and I was so startled that I dropped it, and now the dough is all over
the kitchen floor. I never saw such a mess."

"I'm sorry," answered the youth, trying not to laugh. "We'll see that
it doesn't happen again."

"Yes; that's what you always say," rejoined the motherly-looking woman,
who looked after the interests of Mr. Swift's home.

"Well, we mean it this time," retorted the lad. "We see where our
mistake was; don't we. Mr. Sharp?"

"I think so," replied the other seriously.

"Come on back, and we'll see what damage was done," proposed Tom.
"Maybe we can rig up another container, mix some fresh gas, and make
the final experiment this afternoon."

"Now do be careful," cautioned Mr. Swift, the aged inventor, once more.
"I'm afraid you two have set too hard a task for yourselves this time."

"No we haven't, dad," answered his son. "You'll see us yet skimming
along above the clouds."

"Humph! If you go above the clouds I shan't be very likely to see you.
But go slowly, now. Don't blow the place up again."

Mr. Swift went into the house, followed by Mrs. Baggert, who was loudly
bewailing the fate of her bread. Tom and Mr. Sharp started toward the
shop where they had been working. It was one of several buildings,
built for experimental purposes and patent work by Mr. Swift, near his
home.

"It didn't do so very much damage," observed Tom, as he peered in
through a window, void of all the panes of glass. "We can start right
in."

"Hold on! Wait! Don't try it now!" exclaimed Mr. Sharp, who talked in
short, snappy sentences, which, however, said all he meant. "The fumes
of that gas aren't good to breathe. Wait, until they have blown away.
It won't be long. It's safer."

He began to cough, choking from the pungent odor, and Tom felt an
unpleasant tickling sensation in his throat.

"Take a walk around," advised Mr. Sharp. "I'll be looking over the blue
prints. Let's have 'em."

Tom handed over the roll he had grabbed up when he ran from the shop,
just before the explosion took place, and, while his companion spread
them out on his knee, as he sat on an upturned barrel, the lad walked
toward the rear of the large yard. It was enclosed by a high board
fence, with a locked gate, but Tom, undoing the fastenings, stepped out
into a broad, green meadow at the rear of his father's property.  As he
did so he saw three boys running toward him.

"Hello!" exclaimed our hero. "There are Andy Foger, Sam Snedecker and
Pete Bailey. I wonder what they're heading this way for?"

On the trio came, increasing their pace as they caught sight of Tom.
Andy Foger, a red-haired and squint-eyed lad, a sort of town bully,
with a rich and indulgent father, was the first to reach the young
inventor.

"How--how many are killed?" panted Andy.

"Shall we go for doctors?" asked Sam.

"Can we see the place?" blurted out Pete, and he had to sit down on the
grass, he was so winded.

"Killed? Doctors?" repeated Tom, clearly much puzzled. "What are you
fellows driving at, anyhow?"

"Wasn't there a lot of people killed in the explosion we heard?"
demanded Andy, in eager tones.

"Not a one," replied Tom.

"There was an explosion!" exclaimed Pete. "We heard it, and you can't
fool us!"

"And we saw the smoke," added Snedecker.

"Yes, there was a small explosion," admitted Tom, with a smile, "but no
one was killed; or even hurt. We don't have such things happen in our
shops."

"Nobody killed?" repeated Andy questioningly, and the disappointment
was evident in his tones.

"Nobody hurt?" added Sam, his crony, and he, too, showed his chagrin.

"All our run for nothing," continued Pete, another crony, in disgust.

"What happened?" demanded the red-haired lad, as if he had a right to
know. "We were walking along the lake road, and we heard an awful
racket. If the police come out here, you'll have to tell what it was,
Tom Swift." He spoke defiantly.

"I've no objection to telling you or the police," replied Tom. "There
was an explosion. My friend, Mr. Sharp, the balloonist, and I were
conducting an experiment with a new kind of gas, and it was too strong,
that's all. An aluminum container blew up, but no particular damage was
done. I hope you're satisfied."

"Humph! What you making, anyhow?" demanded Andy, and again he spoke as
if he had a right to know.

"I don't know that it's any of your business," Tom came back at him
sharply, "but, as everyone will soon know, I may as well tell you.
We're building an airship."

"An airship?" exclaimed Sam and Pete in one breath.

"An airship?" queried Andy, and there was a sneer in his voice. "Well,
I don't think you can do it, Tom Swift! You'll never build an airship;
even if you have a balloonist to help you!"

"I won't, eh?" and Tom was a trifle nettled at the sneering manner of
his rival.

"No, you won't! It takes a smarter fellow than you are to build an
airship that will sail. I believe I could beat you at it myself."

"Oh, you think you could?" asked Tom, and this time he had mastered his
emotions. He was not going to let Andy Foger make him angry.  "Maybe
you can beat me at racing, too?" he went on. "If you think so, bring
out your Red Streak and I'll try the Arrow against her. I beat you
twice, and I can do it again!"

This unexpected taunt disconcerted Andy. It was the truth, for, more
than once had Tom, in his motor-boat, proved more than a match for the
squint-eyed bully and his cronies.

"Go back at him, Andy," advised Sam, in a low voice. "Don't take any of
his guff!"

"I don't intend to," spluttered Andy. "Maybe you did beat me in the
races, because my motor wasn't working right," he conceded, "but you
can't do it again. Anyhow, that's got nothing to do with an airship.
I'll bet you can't make one!"

"I don't bet," replied Tom calmly, "but if you wait a few weeks you'll
see me in an airship, and then, if you want to race the Red Streak
against that, I'll accommodate you. Or, if you want to enter into a
competition to build a dirigible balloon or an aeroplane I'm willing."

"Huh! Think you're smart, don't you? Just because you helped save that
balloonist from being killed when his balloon caught fire," went on
Andy, for want of something better to say. "But you'll never build an
airship!"

"Of course he won't!" added Sam and Pete, bound to side with their
crony, to whom they were indebted for many automobile and motor-boat
rides.

"Just wait," advised Tom, with a tantalizing smile. "Meanwhile, if you
want to try the Red Streak against the Arrow, I'm willing. I have an
hour or so to spare."

"Aw, keep still!" muttered Andy, much discomfited, for the defeat of
his speedy boat, by a much smaller and less powerful one, was a sore
point with him. "You just wait, that's all. I'll get even with you!"

"Look here!" cried Tom, suddenly. "You always say that whenever I get
the best of you. I'm sick of hearing it. I consider that a threat, and
I don't like it. If you don't look out, Andy Foger, you'll have trouble
with me, and at no very distant date!"

Tom, with flashing eyes, and clenched fists, took a step forward. Andy
shrank back.

"Don't be afraid of him," advised Sam. "We'll stand by you, Andy."

"I ain't afraid," muttered the red-haired lad, but it was noticed that
he shuffled off. "You just wait, I'll fix you," he added to Tom. The
bully was plainly in a rage.

The young inventor was about to reply, and, possibly would have made a
more substantial rejoinder to Andy than mere words, when the gate
opened, and Mr. Sharp stepped out.

"The fumes have all cleared away, Tom," he said. "We can go in the
shop, now."

Without further notice of Andy Foger, Tom Swift turned aside, and
followed the aeronaut into the enclosed yard.




Chapter 2

Ned Sees Mysterious Men


"Who were those fellows?" asked the balloonist, of his companion.

"Oh, some chaps who think we'll never build our airship, Mr. Sharp.
Andy Foger, and his crowd."

"Well, we'll show them whether we will or not," rejoined the man.
"I've just thought of one point where we made a mistake. Your father
suggested it to me. We need a needle valve in the gas tank. Then we can
control the flow of vapor better."

"Of course!" cried Tom. "Why didn't I think of that? Let's try it." And
the pair hurried into the machine shop, eager to make another test,
which they hoped would be more successful.

The young inventor, for Tom Swift was entitled to that title, having
patented several machines, lived with his father, Barton Swift, on the
outskirts of the small town of Shopton, in New York State. Mr. Swift
was quite wealthy, having amassed a considerable fortune from several
of his patents, as he was also an inventor. Tom's mother had been dead
since he was a small child, and Mrs. Baggert kept house for the widower
and his son. There was also, in their household, an aged engineer,
named Garret Jackson, who attended to the engine and boilers that
operated machinery and apparatus in several small shops that surrounded
the Swift homestead; for Mr. Swift did most of his work at home.

As related in the first volume of this series, entitled "Tom Swift and
His Motor-Cycle," the lad had passed through some strenuous adventures.
A syndicate of rich men, disappointed in a turbine motor they had
acquired from a certain inventor, hired a gang of scoundrels to get
possession of a turbine Mr. Swift had invented. Just before they made
the attempt, however, Tom became possessed of a motor-cycle.  It had
belonged to a wealthy man, Mr. Wakefield Damon, of Waterford, near Lake
Carlopa, which body of water adjoined the town of Shopton; but Mr.
Damon had two accidents with the machine, and sold it to Tom cheap. Tom
was riding his motorcycle to Albany, to deliver his father's model of
the turbine motor to a lawyer, in order to get a patent on it, when he
was attacked by the gang of bad men. These included Ferguson Appleson,
Anson Morse, Wilson Featherton, alias Simpson, Jake Burke, alias Happy
Harry, who sometimes masqueraded as a tramp, and Tod Boreck, alias
Murdock. These men knocked Tom unconscious, stole the valuable model
and some papers, and carried the youth away in their automobile.

Later the young inventor, following a clue given him by Eradicate
Sampson, an aged colored man, who, with his mule, Boomerang, went about
the country doing odd jobs, got on the trail of the thieves in a
deserted mansion in the woods at the upper end of the lake. Our hero,
with the aid of Mr. Damon, and some friends of the latter, raided the
old house, but the men escaped.

In the second book of the series, called "Tom Swift and His
Motor-Boat," there was related the doings of the lad, his father and
his chum, Ned Newton, on Lake Carlopa. Tom bought at auction, a
motor-boat the thieves had stolen and damaged, and, fixing it up, made
a speedy craft of it so speedy, in fact that it beat the racing-boat
Red Streak--owned by Andy Foger. But Tom did more than race in his
boat. He took his father on a tour for his health, and, during Mr.
Swift's absence from home, the gang of bad men stole some of the
inventor's machinery. Tom set out after them in his motor boat, but the
scoundrels even managed to steal that, hoping to get possession of a
peculiar and mysterious treasure in it, and Tom had considerable
trouble.

Among other things he did when he had his craft, was to aid a Miss Mary
Nestor, who, in her cousin's small boat, the Dot, was having trouble
with the engine, and you shall hear more of Miss Nestor presently, for
she and Tom became quite friendly. Events so shaped themselves that
Andy Foger was glad to loan Tom the Red Streak in which to search for
the stolen Arrow, and it was in the later craft that Tom, his father
and Ned Newton had a most thrilling adventure.

They were on their way down the lake when, in the air overhead they saw
a balloon on fire, with a man clinging to the trapeze. They managed to
save the fellow's life, after a strenuous endeavor. The balloonist,
John Sharp, was destined to play quite a part in Tom's life.

Mr. Sharp was more than an aeronaut--he was the inventor of an
airship--that is, he had plans drawn for the more important parts, but
he had struck a "snag of clouds," as he expressed it, and could not
make the machine work. His falling in with Mr. Swift and his son seemed
providential, for Tom and his father were at once interested in the
project for navigating the upper air. They began a study of Mr. Sharp's
plans, and the balloonist was now in a fair way to have the difficulty
solved.

His airship was, primarily an aeroplane, but with a sustaining aluminum
container, shaped like a cigar, and filled with a secret gas, made
partly of hydrogen, being very light and powerful. It was testing the
effect of this gas on a small model of the aluminum container that the
explosion, told of in the first chapter, occurred. In fact it was only
one of several explosions, but, as Tom said, all the while they were
eliminating certain difficulties, until now the airship seemed almost a
finished thing. But a few more details remained to be worked out, and
Mr. Swift and his son felt that they could master these.

So it was with a feeling of no little elation, that the young inventor
followed Mr. Sharp into the shop. The balloonist, it may be explained,
had been invited to live with the Swifts pending the completion of the
airship.

"Do you think we'll get on the right track if we put the needle valve
in?" asked Tom, as he noted with satisfaction that the damage from the
explosion was not great.

"I'm sure we will," answered the aeronaut. "Now let's make another
model container, and try the gas again."

They set to work, with Mr. Swift helping them occasionally, and Garret
Jackson, the engineer, lending a hand whenever he was needed. All that
afternoon work on the airship progressed. The joint inventors of it
wanted to be sure that the sustaining gas bag, or aluminum container,
would do its work properly, as this would hold them in the air, and
prevent accidents, in case of a stoppage of the engine or propellers.

The aeroplane part of the airship was all but finished, and the motor,
a powerful machine, of new design, built by Mr. Swift, was ready to be
installed.

All that afternoon Tom, his father and Mr. Sharp labored in the shop.
As it grew dusk there sounded from the house the ringing of a bell.

"Supper time," remarked Tom, laying aside a wrench. "I wish Mrs.
Baggert would wait about an hour. I'd have this valve nearly done,
then."

But the housekeeper was evidently not going to wait, for her voice
supplemented the bell.

"Supper! Sup-per!" she called. "Come now, Mr. Swift; Tom, Mr. Sharp! I
can't wait any longer! The meat and potatoes will be spoiled!"

"I s'pose we'd better go in," remarked Mr. Sharp, with something of a
sigh. "We can finish to-morrow."

The shop, where certain parts of the airship were being made, was
doubly locked, and Jackson, the engineer, who was also a sort of
watchman, was bidden to keep good guard, for the fear of the gang of
unscrupulous men, who had escaped from jail during a great storm, was
still in the minds of Mr. Swift and his son.

"And give an occasional look in the shed, where the aeroplane is,"
advised Mr. Sharp. "It wouldn't take much to damage that, now."

"I'll pay particular attention to it," promised the engineer. "Don't
worry, Mr. Sharp."

After supper the three gathered around the table on which were spread
out sheets of paper, covered with intricate figures and calculations,
which Mr. Swift and the balloonist went over with care. Tom was
examining some blue prints, which gave a sectional view of the proposed
ship, and was making some measurements when the bell rang, and Mrs.
Baggert ushered in Ned Newton, the most particular chum of the young
inventor.

"Hello, Ned!" exclaimed Tom. "I was wondering what had become of you.
Haven't seen you in a dog's age."

"That's right," admitted Ned. "We've been working late nights at the
bank. Getting ready for the regular visit of the examiner, who usually
comes along about this time. Well, how are things going; and how is the
airship?" for, of course, Ned had heard of that.

"Oh, pretty good. Had another explosion to-day, I s'pose you heard."

"No, I hadn't."

"I thought everyone in town had, for Andy Foger and his two cronies
were on hand, and they usually tell all they know."

"Oh, Andy Foger! He makes me sick! He was scooting up the street in his
auto just as I was coming in, 'honking-honking' his horn to beat the
band! You'd think no one ever had an auto but him. He certainly was
going fast."

"Wait until I get in our airship," predicted Tom. "Then I'll show you
what speed is!"

"Do you really think it will go fast?"

"Of course it will! Fast enough to catch Anson Morse and his crowd of
scoundrels if we could get on their track."

"Why, I thought they were in jail," replied Ned, in some surprise.
"Weren't they arrested after they stole your boat?"

"Yes, and put in jail, but they managed to get out, and now they're
free to make trouble for us again."

"Are you sure they're out of jail?" asked Ned, and Tom noted that his
chum's face wore an odd look.

"Sure? Of course I am. But why do you ask?"

Ned did not answer for a moment. He glanced at Tom's father, and the
young inventor understood. Mr. Swift was getting rather along in age,
and his long years of brain work had made him nervous. He had a great
fear of Morse and his gang, for they had made much trouble for him in
the past. Tom appreciated his chum's hesitancy, and guessed that Ned
had something to say that he did not want Mr. Swift to hear.

"Come on up to my room, Ned. I've got something I want to show you,"
exclaimed Tom, after a pause.

The two lads left the room, Tom glancing apprehensively at his father.
But Mr. Swift was so engrossed, together with the aeronaut, in making
some calculations regarding wind pressure, that it is doubtful if
either of the men were aware that the boys had gone.

"Now what is it, Ned?" demanded our hero, when they were safe in his
apartment. "Something's up. I can tell by your manner. What is it?"

"Maybe it's nothing at all," went on his chum. "If I had known, though
that those men had gotten out of jail, I would have paid more attention
to what I saw to-night, as I was leaving the bank to come here."

"What did you see?" demanded Tom, and his manner, which had been calm,
became somewhat excited.

"Well, you know I've been helping the paying-teller straighten up his
books," went on the young bank employee, "and when I came out to-night,
after working for several hours, I was glad enough to hurry away from
the 'slave-den,' as I call it. I almost ran up the street, not looking
where I was going, when, just as I turned the corner, I bumped into a
man."

"Nothing suspicious or wonderful in that," commented Tom. "I've often
run into people."

"Wait," advised Ned. "To save myself from falling I grabbed the man's
arm. He did the same to me, and there we stood, for a moment, right
under a gas lamp. I looked down at his hands, and I saw that on the
little finger of the left one there was tattooed a blue ring, and--"

"Happy Harry--the tramp!" exclaimed Tom, now much excited. "That's
where he wears a tattooed ring!"

"That's what I thought you had told me," resumed Ned, "but I didn't pay
any attention to it at the time, as I had no idea that the men were out
of jail."

"Well, what else happened?" inquired Tom

"Not much more. I apologized to the man, and he to me, and we let go of
each other."

"Are you sure about the ring on his finger?"

"Positive. His hand was right in the light. But wait, that isn't all.
I hurried on, not thinking much about it, when, I saw another man step
out of the dark shadows of Peterby's grocery, just beyond the bank.
The man must have mistaken me for some one else, for he spoke to me."

"What did he say?"

"He asked me a question. It was: 'Is there any chance to-night?'"

"What did you tell him?"

"Well, I was so surprised that I didn't know what to say, and, before I
could get my wits together the man had seen his mistake and hurried on.
He joined the man I had collided with, and the two skipped off in the
darkness. But not before a third man had come across the street, from
in front of the bank, and hurried off with them."

"Well?" asked Tom, as his chum paused.

"I don't know what to think," resumed Ned. "These men were certainly
acting suspiciously, and, now that you tell me the Anson Morse gang is
not locked up--well, it makes me feel that these must be some of their
crowd."

"Of course they are!" declared Tom positively. "That blue ring proves
it!"

"I wouldn't go so far as to say that," declared Ned. "The man certainly
had a blue ring tattooed on his finger--the same finger where you say
Happy Harry had his. But what would the men be doing in this
neighborhood? They certainly have had a lesson not to meddle with any
of your things."

"No, I don't believe they are after any of dad's inventions this time.
But I tell you what I do believe."

"What?"

"Those men are planning to rob the Shopton Bank, Ned! And I advise you
to notify the officers. That Morse gang is one of the worst in the
country," and Tom, much excited, began to pace the room, while Ned, who
had not dreamed of such an outcome to his narrative, looked startled.

Whitewashed


"Let's tell your father, Tom," suggested Ned, after a pause. "He'll
know what to do."

"No, I'd rather not," answered the young inventor quickly. "Dad has had
trouble enough with these fellows, and I don't want him to worry any
more. Besides, he is working on a new invention, and if I tell him
about the Happy Harry gang it will take his attention from it."

"What invention is he planning now?"

"I don't know, but it's something important by the way he keeps at it.
He hardly spares time to help Mr. Sharp and me on the airship. No,
we'll keep this news from dad."

"Then I'll inform the bank officials, as you suggest. If the place was
robbed they might blame me; if they found out I had seen the men and
failed to tell them."

"Well, that gang would only be too glad to have the blame fall on some
one else."

Tom little knew how near the truth he had come in his chance
expression, or how soon he himself was to fall under suspicion in
connection with this same band of bad men.

"I'll telephone to the president on my way home," decided Ned, "and he
can notify the watchman at the bank. But do you really expect to have
your airship in shape to fly soon?"

"Oh, yes. Now that we have found out our mistake about the gas, the
rest will be easy."

"I think I'd like to take a trip in one myself, if it didn't go too
high," ventured Ned.

"I'll remember that, when we have ours completed," promised his chum,
"and I'll take you for a spin."

The boys talked for perhaps an hour longer, mostly about the airship,
for it was the latest mechanical affair in which Tom was interested,
and, naturally, foremost in his thoughts. Then Ned went home first,
however, telephoning from Tom's house to the bank president about
having seen the suspicious men. That official thanked his young
employee, and said he would take all necessary precautions. The
telephone message was not sent until Mr. Swift was out of hearing, as
Tom was determined that his father should have no unnecessary worry
about the unscrupulous men. As it was, the news that the gang was out
of jail had caused the aged inventor some alarm.

It was not without some anxiety that Tom arose the next morning,
fearing he would hear news that the bank had been broken into, but no
such alarming report circulated in Shopton. In fact having made some
inquiries that day of Ned, he learned that no trace had been seen of
the mysterious men. The police had been on the lookout, but they had
seen nothing of them.

"Maybe, after all, they weren't the same ones," suggested Ned, when he
paid Tom another visit the next night.

"Well, of course it's possible that they weren't," admitted the young
inventor. "I'd be very glad to think so. Even if they were, your
encounter with them may have scared them off; and that would be a good
thing."

The next two weeks were busy ones for Tom and Mr. Sharp. Aided
occasionally by Mr. Swift, and with Garret Jackson, the engineer, to
lend a hand whenever needed, the aeronaut and the owner of the speedy
Arrow made considerable progress on their airship.

"What is your father so busy over?" asked Mr. Sharp one day, when the
new aluminum gas holder was about completed.

"I don't know," answered Tom, with a somewhat puzzled air. "He doesn't
seem to want to talk about it, even to me. He says it will
revolutionize travel along a certain line, but whether he is working on
an airship that will rival ours, or a new automobile, I can't make out.
He'll tell us in good time. But when do you think we will finish
the--well, I don't know what to call it--I mean our aeroplane?"

"Oh, in about a month now. That's so, though, we haven't a name for it.
But we'll christen it after it's completed. Now if you'll tighten up
some of those bolts I'll get the gas generating apparatus in readiness
for another test."

A short description of the new airship may not be out of place now. It
was built after plans Mr. Sharp had shown to Tom and his father soon
after the thrilling rescue of the aeronaut from the blazing balloon
over Lake Carlopa. The general idea of the airship was that of the
familiar aeroplane, but in addition to the sustaining surfaces of the
planes, there was an aluminum, cigar-shaped tank, holding a new and
very powerful gas, which would serve to keep the ship afloat even when
not in motion.

Two sets of planes, one above the other, were used, bringing the
airship into the biplane class. There were also two large propellers,
one in front and the other at the rear. These were carefully made, of
different layers of wood "built up" as they are called, to make them
stronger. They were eight feet in diameter, and driven by a
twenty-cylinder, air-cooled, motor, whirled around at the rate of
fifteen hundred revolutions a minute. When operated at full speed the
airship was capable of making eighty miles an hour, against a moderate
wind.

But if the use of the peculiarly-shaped planes and the gas container,
with the secret but powerful vapor in it were something new in airship
construction, so was the car in which the operator and travelers were
to live during a voyage. It was a complete living room, with the engine
and other apparatus, including that for generating the gas, in a
separate compartment, and the whole was the combined work of Tom and
Mr. Sharp. There were accommodations for five persons, with sleeping
berths, a small galley or kitchen, where food could be prepared, and
several easy chairs where the travelers could rest in comfort while
skimming along high in the air, as fast as the fastest railroad train.

There was room enough to carry stores for a voyage of a week or more,
and enough gas could be manufactured aboard the ship, in addition to
that taken in the aluminum case before starting, to sustain the ship
for two weeks. The engine, steering apparatus, and the gas machine were
within easy reach and control of the pilot, who was to be stationed in
a small room in the "bow" of the ship. An electric stove served to warm
the interior of the car, and also provided means for cooking the food.

The airship could be launched either by starting it along the ground,
on rubber-tired wheels, as is done in the case of the ordinary
aeroplane, or it could be lifted by the gas, just as is done with a
balloon. In short there were many novel features about the ship.

The gas test, which took place a few days later, showed that the young
inventor and Mr. Sharp had made no mistake this time. No explosion
followed, the needle valve controlling the powerful vapor perfectly.

"Well," remarked Mr. Sharp, one afternoon, "I think we shall put the
ship together next week, Tom, and have a trial flight. We shall need a
few more aluminum bolts, though, and if you don't mind you might jump
on your motor-cycle and run to Mansburg for them. Merton's machine shop
ought to have some."

Mansburg was the nearest large city to Shopton, and Merton was a
machinist who frequently did work for Mr. Swift.

"All right," agreed Tom. "I'll start now. How many will you need?"

"Oh, a couple of dozen."

Tom started off, wheeling his cycle from the shed where it was kept.
As he passed the building where the big frame of the airship, with the
planes and aluminum bag had been assembled, he looked in.

"We'll soon be flying through the clouds on your back," he remarked,
speaking to the apparatus as if it could understand. "I guess we'll
smash some records, too, if that engine works as well when it's
installed as it does now."

Tom had purchased the bolts, and was on his way back with them, when,
as he passed through one of the outlying streets of Mansburg, something
went wrong with his motor-cycle. He got off to adjust it, finding that
it was only a trifling matter, which he soon put right, when he was
aware of a man standing, observing him. Without looking up at the man's
face, the young inventor was unpleasantly aware of a sharp scrutiny. He
could hardly explain it, but it seemed as if the man had evil
intentions toward him, and it was not altogether unexpected on Tom's
part, when, looking up, he saw staring at him, Anson Morse, the leader
of the gang of men who had caused such trouble for him.

"Oh, it's you; is it?" asked Morse, an ugly scowl on his face. "I
thought I recognized you." He moved nearer to Tom, who straightened up,
and stood leaning on his wheel.

"Yes; it's me," admitted the lad.

"I've been looking for you," went on Morse. "I'm not done with you yet,
nor your father, either."

"Aren't you?" asked Tom, trying to speak coolly, though his heart was
beating rather faster than usual. Morse had spoken in a threatening
manner, and, as the youth looked up and down the street he saw that it
was deserted; nor were there any houses near.

"No, I'm not," snapped the man. "You got me and my friends in a lot of
trouble, and--"

"You didn't get half what you deserved!" burst out Tom, indignant at
the thought of what he and his father had suffered at the hands of the
gang. "You ought to be in jail now, instead of out; and if I could see
a policeman, I'd have you arrested for threatening me! That's against
the law!"

"Huh! I s'pose you think you know lots about the law," sneered Morse.
"Well, I tell you one thing, if you make any further trouble for me,
I'll--"

"I'll make all the trouble I can!" cried Tom, and he boldly faced the
angry man. "I'm not afraid of you!"

"You'd better be!" and Morse spoke in a vindictive manner. "We'll get
even with you yet, Tom Swift. In fact I've a good notion now to give
you a good thrashing for what you've done."

Before Tom was aware of the man's intention, Morse had stepped quickly
into the street, where the lad stood beside his wheel, and grasped him
by the shoulder. He gave Tom a vicious shake.

"Take your hand off me!" cried Tom, who was hampered by having to hold
up his heavy machine.

"I will when I've given you what I owe you!" retorted the scoundrel.
"I'm going to have satisfaction now if I never--"

At that instant there came from down the street the sound of a rattling
and bumping. Tom looked up quickly, and saw approaching a rattletrap of
a wagon, drawn by a big, loose-jointed mule, the large ears of which
were flapping to and fro. The animal was advancing rapidly, in response
to blows and words from the colored driver, and, before the uplifted
fist of Morse could fall on Tom's head, the outfit was opposite them.

"Hold on dar, mistah! Hold on!" cried the colored man in the wagon.
"What are yo' doin' to mah friend, Mistah Swift?"

"None of your business!" snapped Morse. "You drive on and let me manage
this affair if you don't want trouble! Who are you anyhow?"

"Why doan't yo' know me?" asked the colored man, at whom Tom looked
gratefully. "I's Eradicate Sampson, an' dish yeah am mah mule,
Boomerang. Whoa, Boomerang! I reckon yo' an' I better take a hand in
dish yeah argument."

"Not unless you want trouble!" cried Morse.

"I doan't mind trouble, not in de leastest," answered Eradicate
cheerfully. "Me an' Boomerang has had lots of trouble. We's used to it.
No, Mistah Man, you'd better let go ob mah friend, Mistah Swift, if yo'
doan't want trouble yo' ownse'f."

"Drive on, and mind your business!" cried Morse, now unreasoningly
angry. "This is my affair," and he gave Tom a shake.

Our hero was not going to submit tamely, however. He had one hand free,
and raised to strike Morse, but the latter, letting go his hold on the
lad's shoulder, grasped with that hand, the fist which the young
inventor had raised. Then, with his other hand, the scoundrel was about
to hit Tom.

"Break away four him, Mistah Swift!" directed the colored man. "Yo' can
fight him, den!"

"I guess he'll have his own troubles doing that," sneered Morse.

"Not ef I help him," answered Eradicate promptly, as he climbed back
off the seat, into the body of his ramshackle vehicle.

"Don't you interfere with me!" stormed the man.

An instant later Tom broke away from his tormentor, and laid his
motor-cycle on the ground, in order to have both hands free for the
attack he felt would follow.

"Ha! You think you're going to escape, do you?" cried Morse, as he
started toward Tom, his eyes blazing. "I'll show you who you're dealing
with!"

"Yes, an' I reckon I'll show yo' suffin yo' ain't lookin' fer!"
suddenly cried Eradicate.

With a quick motion he picked up a pail of white-wash from his wagon,
and, with sure aim, emptied the contents of the bucket over Morse, who
was rushing at Tom. The white fluid spread over the man from head to
foot, enveloping him as in a white shroud, and his advance was
instantly checked.

"Dar! I reckon dat's de quickest white-washin' job I done in some
time!" chuckled Eradicate, as he grasped his long handled brush, and
clambered down from the wagon, ready for a renewal of the hostilities
on the part of Morse. "De bestest white-washin' job I done in some
time; yais, sah!"




Chapter 4

A Trial Trip


There was no fear that Anson Morse would return to the attack. Blinded
by the whitewash which ran in his eyes, but which, being slaked, did
not burn him, he grouped blindly about, pawing the air with his
outstretched hands.

"You wait! You wait! You'll suffer for this!" he spluttered, as soon as
he could free his mouth from the trickling fluid. Then, wiping it from
his face, with his hands, as best he could, he shook his fist at Tom.
"I'll pay you and that black rascal back!" he cried. "You wait!"

"I hopes yo' pays me soon," answered Eradicate, "'case as how dat
whitewash was wuff twenty-five cents, an' I got t' go git mo' to finish
doin' a chicken coop I'm wurkin' on. Whoa, dar Boomerang. Dere ain't
goin' t' be no mo' trouble I reckon."

Morse did not reply. He had been most unexpectedly repulsed, and, with
the white-wash dripping from his garments, he turned and fairly ran
toward a strip of woodland that bordered the highway at that place.

Tom approached the colored man, and held out a welcoming hand.

"I don't know what I'd done if you hadn't come along, Rad," the lad
said. "That fellow was desperate, and this was a lonely spot to be
attacked. Your whitewash came in mighty handy."

"Yais, sah, Mistah Swift, dat's what it done. I knowed I could use it
on him, ef he got too obstreperous, an' dat's what he done. But I were
goin' to fight him wif mah bresh, ef he'd made any more trouble."

"Oh, I fancy we have seen the last of him for some time," said Tom, but
he looked worried. It was evident that the Happy Harry gang was still
hanging around the neighborhood of Shopton, and the fact that Morse was
bold enough to attack our hero in broad day-light argued that he felt
little fear of the authorities.

"Ef yo' wants t' catch him, Mistah Swift," went on Eradicate, "yo' kin
trace him by de whitewash what drops offen him," and he pointed to a
trail of white drops which showed the path Morse had taken.

"No, the less I have to do with him the better I like it," answered the
lad. "But I can't thank you enough, Rad. You have helped me out of
difficulties several times now. You put me on the trail of the men in
the deserted mansion, you warned me of the log Andy Foger placed across
the road, and now you have saved me from Morse."

"Oh, dat's nuffin, Mistah Swift. Yo' has suah done lots fo' me.
'Sides, mah mule, Boomerang, am entitled t' de most credit dish yeah
time. I were comin' down de street, on mah way t' a whitewashin' job,
when I seen yo', an yo' lickitysplit machine," for so Eradicate
designated a motorcycle. "I knowed it were yo', an' I didn't laik de
looks ob dat man. Den I see he had hold ob you, an' I t'ought he were a
burglar. So I yelled t' Boomerang t' hurry up. Now, mostly, when I
wants Boomerang t' hurry, he goes slow, an' when I wants him t' go
slow, he runs away. But dish yeah time he knowed he were comin' t' help
yo', an' he certainly did leg it, dat's what he done! He run laik he
were goin' home t' a stable full ob oats, an' dat's how I got heah so
quick. Den I t'ought ob de whitewash, an' I jest used it."

"It was the most effective weapon you could have used," said Tom,
gratefully.

"Deed no, Mistah Swift, I didn't hab no weapon," spoke Eradicate
earnestly. "I ain't eben got mah razor, 'case I left it home. I didn't
hab no weapon at all. I jest used de whitewash, laik yo' seen me."

"That's what I meant," answered Tom, trying not to laugh at the simple
negro's misunderstanding. "I'm ever so much obliged to you, just the
same, and here's a half dollar to pay for the whitewash."

"Oh, no, Mistah Swift, I doan't want t' take it. I kin make mo'
whitewash."

But Tom insisted, and picked up his machine to sprint for home.
Eradicate started to tell over again, how he urged Boomerang on, but
the lad had no time to listen.

"But I didn't hab no weapon, Mistah Swift, no indeedy, none at all, not
even mah razor," repeated Eradicate. "Only de pail ob whitewash.  That
is, lessen yo' calls mah bresh a weapon."

"Well, it's a sort of one," admitted Tom, with a laugh as he started
his machine. "Come around next week, Rad. We have some dirt eradicating
for you to attend to."

"Deed an' I will, Mistah Swift. Eradicate is mah name, an' I eradicates
de dirt. But dat man such did look odd, wif dat pail ob whitewash all
ober him. He suah did look most extraordinarily. Gidap, Boomerang. See
if yo' can break some mo' speed records now."

But the mule appeared to be satisfied with what he had done, and, as he
rode off, Tom looked back to see the colored man laboring to get the
sleepy, animal started.

The lad did not tell his father of the adventure with Morse, but he
related the occurrence to Mr. Sharp.

"I'd like to get hold of that scoundrel, and the others in the gang!"
exclaimed the balloonist. "I'd take him up in the airship, and drop him
down into the lake. He's a bad man. So are the others. Wonder what they
want around here?"

"That's what's puzzling me," admitted Tom. "I hope dad doesn't hear
about them or he will be sure to worry; and maybe it will interfere
with his new ideas."

"He hasn't told you yet what he's engaged in inventing; has he?"

"No, and I don't like to ask him. He said the other day, though, that
it would rival our airship, but in a different way."

"I wonder what he meant?"

"It's hard to say. But I don't believe he can invent anything that will
go ahead of our craft, even if he is my own father, and the best one in
the world," said Tom, half jokingly. "Well, I got the bolts, now let's
get to work. I'm anxious for a trial trip."

"No more than I am. I want to see if my ideas will work out in practice
as well as they do in theory."

For a week or more Tom and Mr. Sharp labored on the airship, with Mr.
Jackson to help them. The motor, with its twenty cylinders, was
installed, and the big aluminum holder fastened to the frame of the
planes. The rudders, one to control the elevation and depression of the
craft, and the other to direct its flight to the right or left, were
attached, and the steering wheel, as well as the levers regulating the
motor were put in place.

"About all that remains to be done now," said the aeronaut one night,
as he and Tom stood in the big shed, looking at their creation, "is to
fit up the car, and paint the machine."

"Can't we make a trial trip before we fit up the car ready for a long
flight?" asked the young inventor.

"Yes, but I wouldn't like to go out without painting the ship. Some
parts of it might rust if we get into the moist, cloudy, upper regions."

"Then let's paint it to-morrow, and, as soon as it's dry we'll have a
test."

"All right. I'll mix the paint the first thing in the morning."

It took two days to paint the machine, for much care had to be used,
and, when it was finished Tom looked admiringly up at it.

"We ought to name it," suggested Mr. Sharp, as he removed a bit of
paint from the end of the nose.

"To be sure," agreed Tom. "And hold on, I have the very name for
it--Red Cloud!"

"Red Cloud?" questioned Mr. Sharp.

"Yes!" exclaimed Tom, with enthusiasm. "It's painted red--at least the
big, aluminum gas container is--and we hope to go above the clouds in
it. Why not Red Cloud?"

"That's what it shall be!" conceded the balloonist. "If I had a bottle
of malted milk, or something like that, I'd christen it."

"We ought to have a young lady to do that part," suggested Tom. "They
always have young ladies to name ships."

"Were you thinking of any particular young lady?" asked Mr. Sharp
softly, and Tom blushed; as he replied:

"Oh no--of course that is--well--Oh, hang it, christen it yourself, and
let me alone," he finished.

"Well, in the absence of Miss Mary Nestor, who, I think, would be the
best one for the ceremony," said Mr. Sharp, with a twinkle in his eyes,
"I christen thee Red Cloud," and with that he sprinkled some water on
the pointed nose of the red aluminum gas bag, for the aeronaut and Tom
were on a high staging, on a level with the upper part of the airship.

"Red Cloud it is!" cried Tom, enthusiastically. "Now, to-morrow we'll
see what it can do."

The day of the test proved all that could be desired in the way of
weather. The fact that an airship was being constructed in the Swift
shops had been kept as secret as possible, but of course many in
Shopton knew of it, for Andy Foger had spread the tidings.

"I hope we won't have a crowd around to see us go up," said Tom, as he
and Mr. Sharp went to the shed to get the Red Cloud in readiness for
the trial. "I shouldn't want to have them laugh at us, if we fail to
rise."

"Don't worry. We'll go up all right," declared Mr. Sharp. "The only
thing I'm at all worried about is our speed. I want to go fast, but we
may not be able to until our motor gets 'tuned-up'.  But we'll rise."

The gas machine had already been started, and the vapor was hissing
inside the big aluminum holder. It was decided to try to go up under
the lifting power of the gas, and not use the aeroplane feature for
sending aloft the ship, as there was hardly room, around the shops, for
a good start.

When enough of the vapor had been generated to make the airship
buoyant, the big doors of the shed were opened, and Tom and Mr. Sharp,
with the aid of Garret and Mr. Swift, shoved it slowly out.

"There it is! There she comes!" cried several voices outside the high
fence that surrounded the Swift property. "They're going up!"

"Andy Foger is in that bunch," remarked Tom with a grim smile. "I hope
we don't fail."

"We won't. Don't worry," advised Mr. Sharp.

The shouts outside the fence increased. It was evident that quite a
crowd of boys, as well as men, had collected, though it was early in
the morning. Somehow, news of the test had leaked out.

The ship continued to get lighter and lighter as more gas was
generated. It was held down by ropes, fastened to stakes driven in the
ground. Mr. Sharp entered the big car that was suspended, below the
aeroplanes.

"Come on, Tom," the aeronaut called. "We're almost ready to fly. Will
you come too, Mr. Swift, and Garret?"

"Some other time," promised the aged inventor. "It looks as though you
were going to succeed, though. I'll wait, however, until after the test
before I venture."

"How about you, Garret?" asked Tom of the engineer, as the young
inventor climbed into the car.

"The ground is good enough for me," was the answer, with a smile.
"Broken bones don't mend so easily when you're past sixty-five."

"But we're not going to fall!" declared Mr. Sharp. "All ready, Tom.
Cast off! Here we go!"

The restraining ropes were quickly cast aside. Slowly at first, and
then with a rush, as though feeling more and more sure of herself, the
Red Cloud arose in the air like a gigantic bird of scarlet plumage. Up
and up it went, higher than the house, higher than the big shed where
it had been built, higher, higher, higher!

"There she is!" cried the shrill voices of the boys in the meadow, and
the hoarser tones of the men mingled with them.

"Hurrah!" called Tom softly to the balloonist. "We're off!" and he
waved his hand to his father and Garret.

"I told you so," spoke Mr. Sharp confidently. "I'm going to start the
propellers in a minute."

"Oh, dear me, goodness sakes alive!" cried Mrs. Baggert, the
housekeeper, running from the house and wringing her hands. "I'm sure
they'll fall!"

She looked up apprehensively, but Tom only waved his hand to her, and
threw her a kiss. Clearly he had no fears, though it was the first time
he had ever been in an airship. Mr. Sharp was as calm and collected as
an ocean captain making his hundredth trip across the Atlantic.

"Throw on the main switch," he called to our hero, and Tom, moving to
amidships in the car, did as directed. Mr. Sharp pulled several levers,
adjusted some valves, and then, with a rattle and bang, the huge,
twenty-cylinder motor started.

Waiting a moment to see that it was running smoothly, Mr. Sharp grasped
the steering wheel. Then, with a quick motion he threw the two
propellers in gear. They began to whirl around rapidly.

"Here we go!" cried Tom, and, sure enough, the Red Cloud, now five
hundred feet in the air, shot forward, like a boat on the water, only
with such a smooth, gliding, easy motion, that it seemed like being
borne along on a cloud.

"She works! She works!" cried the balloonist. "Now to try our elevation
rudder," and, as the Red Cloud gathered speed, he tilted the small
planes which sent the craft up or down, according to the manner in
which they were tilted. The next instant the airship was pointed at an
angle toward the clouds, and shooting along at swift speed, while, from
below came the admiring cheers of the crowd of boys and men.




Chapter 5

Colliding With A Tower


"She seems to work," observed Tom, looking from where he was stationed
near some electrical switches, toward Mr. Sharp.

"Of course she does," replied the aeronaut. "I knew it would, but I
wasn't so sure that it would scoot along in this fashion. We're making
pretty good speed, but we'll do better when the motor gets to running
smoother."

"How high up are we?" asked Tom.

The balloonist glanced at several gauges near the steering wheel.

"A little short of three thousand feet," he answered. "Do you want to
go higher?"

"No--no--I--I guess not," was Tom's answer. He halted over the works,
and his breath came in gasps.

"Don't get alarmed," called Mr. Sharp quickly, noting that his
companion was in distress because of the high altitude. "That always
happens to persons who go into a thin air for the first time; just as
if you had climbed a high mountain. Breathe as slowly as you can, and
swallow frequently. That will relieve the pressure on your ear drums.
I'll send the ship lower."

Tom did as he was advised, and the aeronaut, deflecting the rudder,
sent the Red Cloud on a downward slant. Tom at once felt relieved, both
because the action of swallowing equalized the pressure on the ear
drums, and because the airship was soon in a more dense atmosphere,
more like that of the earth.

"How are you now?" asked the man of the lad, as the craft was again on
an even keel.

"All right," replied Tom, briskly. "I didn't know what ailed me at
first."

"I was troubled the same way when I first went up in a balloon,"
commented Mr. Sharp. "We'll run along for a few miles, at an elevation
of about five hundred feet, and then we'll go to within a hundred feet
of the earth, and see how the Red Cloud behaves under different
conditions. Take a look below and see what you think of it."

Tom looked low, through one of several plate glass windows in the floor
of the car. He gave a gasp of astonishment.

"Why! We're right over Lake Carlopa!" he gasped.

"Of course," admitted Mr. Sharp with a laugh. "And I'm glad to say that
we're better off than when I was last in the air over this same body of
water," and he could scarcely repress a shudder as he thought of his
perilous position in the blazing balloon, as related in detail in "Tom
Swift and His Motor-Boat."

The lake was spread out below the navigators of the air like some
mirror of silver in a setting of green fields. Tom could see a winding
river, that flowed into the lake, and he noted towns, villages, and
even distant cities, interspersed here and there with broad farms or
patches of woodlands, like a bird's-eye view of a stretch of country.

"This is great!" he exclaimed, with enthusiasm. "I wouldn't miss this
for the world!"

"Oh, you haven't begun to see things yet," replied Mr. Sharp. "Wait
until we take a long trip, which we'll do soon, as this ship is
behaving much better than I dared to hope. Well, we're five hundred
feet high now, and I'll run along at that elevation for a while."

Objects on the earth became more distinct now, and Tom could observe
excited throngs running along and pointing upward. They were several
miles from Shopton, and the machinery was running smoothly; the motor,
with its many cylinders purring like a big cat.

"We could have lunch, if we'd brought along anything to eat," observed
Tom.

"Yes," assented his companion. "But I think we'll go back now. Your
father may be anxious. Just come here, Tom, and I'll show you how to
steer. I'm going down a short distance."

He depressed the rudder, and the Red Cloud shot earthward. Then, as the
airship was turned about, the young inventor was allowed to try his
hand at managing it. He said, afterward, that it was like guiding a
fleecy cloud.

"Point her straight for Shopton," counseled Mr. Sharp, when he had
explained the various wheels and levers to the lad.

"Straight she is," answered the lad, imitating a sailor's reply. "Oh,
but this is great! It beats even my motor-boat!"

"It goes considerably faster, at all events," remarked Mr. Sharp.
"Keep her steady now, while I take a look at the engine. I want to be
sure it doesn't run hot."

He went aft, where all the machinery in the car was located, and Tom
was left alone in the small pilot house. He felt a thrill as he looked
down at the earth beneath him, and saw the crowds of wonder-gazers
pointing at the great, red airship flying high over their heads.
Rapidly the open fields slipped along, giving place to a large city.

"Rocksmond," murmured Tom, as he noted it. "We're about fifty miles
from home, but we'll soon be back in the shed at this rate. We
certainly are slipping along. A hundred and fifty feet elevation," he
went on, as he looked at a gauge. "I wonder if I'll ever get used to
going several miles up in the air?"

He shifted the rudder a bit, to go to the left. The Red Cloud obeyed
promptly, but, the next instant something snapped. Tom, with a startled
air, looked around. He could see nothing wrong, but a moment later, the
airship dipped suddenly toward the earth. Then it seemed to increase
its forward speed, and, a few seconds later, was rushing straight at a
tall, ornamental tower that rose from one corner of a large building.

"Mr. Sharp! Mr. Sharp!" cried the lad. "Something has happened! We're
heading for that tower!"

"Steer to one side!" called the balloonist.

Tom tried, but found that the helm had become jammed. The horizontal
rudder would not work, and the craft was rushing nearer and nearer,
every minute, to the pile of brick and mortar.

"We're going to have a collision!" shouted Tom. "Better shut off the
power!"

The two propellers were whirling around so swiftly that they looked
like blurs of light. Mr. Sharp came rushing forward, and Tom
relinquished the steering wheel to him. In vain did the aeronaut try to
change the course of the airship. Then, with a shout to Tom to
disconnect the electric switch, the man turned off the power from the
motor.

But it was too late. Straight at the tower rushed the Red Cloud, and, a
moment later had hit it a glancing blow, smashing the forward
propeller, and breaking off both blades. The nose of the aluminum gas
container knocked off a few bricks from the tower, and then, the ship
losing way, slowly settled to the flat roof of the building.

"We're smashed!" cried Tom, with something like despair in his voice.

"That's nothing! Don't worry! It might be worse! Not the first time
I've had an accident. It's only one propeller, and I can easily make
another," said Mr. Sharp, in his quick, jerky sentences. He had allowed
some of the gas to escape from the container, making the ship less
buoyant, so that it remained on the roof.

The aeronaut and Tom looked from the windows of the car, to note if any
further damage had been done. They were just congratulating themselves
that the rudder marked the extent, when, from a scuttle in the roof
there came a procession of young ladies, led by an elderly matron,
wearing spectacles and having a very determined, bristling air.

"Well, I must say, this is a very unceremonious proceeding!" exclaimed
the spectacled woman. "Pray, gentlemen, to what are we indebted for
this honor?"

"It was an accident, ma'am," replied Mr. Sharp, removing his hat, and
bowing. "A mere accident!"

"Humph! I suppose it was an accident that the tower of this building
was damaged, if not absolutely loosened at the foundations. You will
have to pay the damages!" Then turning, and seeing about two score of
young ladies behind her on the flat roof, each young lady eying with
astonishment, not unmixed with admiration, the airship, the elderly one
added: "Pupils! To your rooms at once! How dare you leave without
permission?"

"Oh, Miss Perkman!" exclaimed a voice, at the sound of which Tom
started. "Mayn't we see the airship? It will be useful in our natural
philosophy study!"

Tom looked at the young lady who had spoken. "Mary Nestor!" he
exclaimed.

"Tom--I mean Mr. Swift!" she rejoined. "How in the world did you get
here?"

"I was going to ask you the same question," retorted the lad. "We flew
here."

"Young ladies! Silence!" cried Miss Perkman, who was evidently the
principal of the school. "The idea of any one of you daring to speak to
these--these persons--without my permission, and without an
introduction! I shall make them pay heavily for damaging my seminary,"
she added, as she strode toward Mr. Sharp, who, by this time, was out
of the car. "To your rooms at once!" Miss Perkman ordered again, but
not a young lady moved. The airship was too much of an attraction for
them.




Chapter 6

Getting Off The Roof


For a few minutes Mr. Sharp was so engrossed with looking underneath
the craft, to ascertain in what condition the various planes and braces
were, that he paid little attention to the old maid school principal,
after his first greeting. But Miss Perkman was not a person to be
ignored.

"I want pay for the damage to the tower of my school," she went on. "I
could also demand damages for trespassing on my roof, but I will
refrain in this case. Young ladies, will you go to your rooms?" she
demanded.

"Oh, please, let us stay," pleaded Mary Nestor, beside whom Tom now
stood. "Perhaps Professor Swift will lecture on clouds and air currents
and--and such things as that," the girl went on slyly, smiling at the
somewhat embarrassed lad.

"Ahem! If there is a professor present, perhaps it might be a good idea
to absorb some knowledge," admitted the old maid, and, unconsciously,
she smoothed her hair, and settled her gold spectacles straighter on
her nose. "Professor, I will delay collecting damages on behalf of the
Rocksmond Young Ladies Seminary, while you deliver a lecture on air
currents," she went on, addressing herself to Mr. Sharp.

"Oh, I'm not a professor," he said quickly. "I'm a professional
balloonist, parachute jumper. Give exhibitions at county fairs. Leap
for life, and all that sort of thing. I guess you mean my friend. He's
smart enough for a professor. Invented a lot of things. How much is the
damage?"

"No professor?" cried Miss Perkman indignantly. "Why I understood from
Miss Nestor that she called some one professor."

"I was referring to my friend, Mr. Swift," said Mary. "His father's a
professor, anyhow, isn't he, Tom? I mean Mr. Swift!"

"I believe he has a degree, but he never uses it," was the lad's answer.

"Ha!  Then I have been deceived!  There is no professor present!" and
the old maid drew herself up as though desirous of punishing some one.
"Young ladies, for the last time, I order you to your rooms," and, with
a dramatic gesture she pointed to the scuttle through which the
procession had come.

"Say something, Tom--I mean Mr. Swift," appealed Mary Nestor, in a
whisper, to our hero. "Can't you give some sort of a lecture? The girls
are just crazy to hear about the airship, and this ogress won't let us.
Say something!"

"I--I don't know what to say," stammered Tom.

But he was saved the necessity for just then several women, evidently
other teachers, came out on the roof.

"Oh, an airship!" exclaimed one. "How lovely! We thought it was an
earthquake, and we were afraid to come up for quite a while. But an
airship! I've always wanted to see one, and now I have an opportunity.
It will be just the thing for my physical geography and natural history
class. Young ladies, attention, and I will explain certain things to
you."

"Miss Delafield, do you understand enough about an airship to lecture
on one?" asked Miss Perkman smartly.

"Enough so that my class may benefit," answered the other teacher, who
was quite pretty.

"Ahem! That is sufficient, and a different matter," conceded Miss
Perkman. "Young ladies, give your undivided attention to Miss
Delafield, and I trust you will profit by what she tells you.
Meanwhile I wish to have some conversation concerning damages with the
persons who so unceremoniously visited us. It is a shame that the
pupils of the Rocksmond Seminary should be disturbed at their studies.
Sir, I wish to talk with you," and the principal pointed a long,
straight finger at Mr. Sharp.

"Young ladies, attention!" called Miss Delafield. "You will observe the
large red body at the top, that is--"

"I'd rather have you explain it," whispered Mary Nestor to Tom. "Come
on, slip around to the other side. May I bring a few of my friends with
me? I can't bear Miss Delafield. She thinks she knows everything.  She
won't see us if we slip around."

"I shall be delighted," replied Tom, "only I fear I may have to help
Mr. Sharp out of this trouble."

"Don't worry about me, Tom," said the balloonist, who overheard him.
"Let me do the explaining. I'm an old hand at it. Been in trouble
before. Many a time I've had to pay damages for coming down in a
farmer's corn field. I'll attend to the lady principal, and you can
explain things to the young ones," and, with a wink, the jolly aeronaut
stepped over to where Miss Perkman, in spite of her prejudice against
the airship, was observing it curiously.

Glad to have the chance to talk to his young lady friend, Tom slipped
to the opposite side of the car with her and a few of her intimate
friends, to whom she slyly beckoned. There Tom told how the Red Cloud
came to be built, and of his first trip in the air, while, on the
opposite side, Miss Delafield lectured to the entire school on
aeronautics, as she thought she knew them.

Mr. Sharp evidently did know how to "explain" matters to the irate
principal, for, in a short while, she was smiling. By this time Tom had
about finished his little lecture, and Miss Delafield was at the end of
hers. The entire school of girls was grouped about the Red Cloud,
curiously examining it, but Mary Nestor and her friends probably
learned more than any of the others. Tom was informed that his friend
had been attending the school in Rocksmond since the fall term opened.

"I little thought, when I found we were going to smash into that tower,
that you were below there, studying," said the lad to the girl.

"I'm afraid I wasn't doing much studying," she confessed. "I had just a
glimpse of the airship through the window, and I was wondering who was
in it, when the crash came. Miss Perkman, who is nothing if not brave,
at once started for the roof, and we girls all followed her.  However,
are you going to get the ship down?"

"I'm afraid it is going to be quite a job," admitted Tom ruefully.
"Something went wrong with the machinery, or this never would have
happened. As soon as Mr. Sharp has settled with your principal we'll
see what we can do."

"I guess he's settled now," observed Miss Nestor. "Here he comes."

The aeronaut and Miss Perkman were approaching together, and the old
maid did not seem half so angry as she had been.

"You see," Mr. Sharp was saying, "it will be a good advertisement for
your school. Think of having the distinction of having harbored the
powerful airship, Red Cloud, on your roof."

"I never thought of it in that light," admitted the principal.
"Perhaps you are right. I shall put it in my next catalog."

"And, as for damages to the tower, we will pay you fifty dollars,"
continued the balloonist. "Do you agree to that, Mr. Swift?" he asked
Tom. "I think your father, the professor, would call that fair."

"Oh, as long as this airship is partly the property of a professor,
perhaps I should only take thirty-five dollars," put in Miss Perkman.
"I am a great admirer of professors--I mean in a strictly educational
sense," she went on, as she detected a tendency on the part of some of
the young ladies to giggle.

"No, fifty dollars will be about right," went on Mr. Sharp, pulling out
a well-filled wallet. "I will pay you now."

"And if you will wait I will give you a receipt," continued the
principal, evidently as much appeased at the mention of a professor's
title, as she was by the money.

"We're getting off cheap," the balloonist whispered to Tom, as the head
of the seminary started down the scuttle to the class-rooms below.

"Maybe it's easier getting out of that difficulty than it will be to
get off the roof," replied the lad.

"Don't worry. Leave that to me," the aeronaut said. It took
considerable to ruffle Mr. Sharp.

With a receipt in full for the damage to the tower, and expressing the
hope that, some day, in the near future, Professor Swift would do the
seminary the honor of lecturing to the young lady pupils, Miss Perkman
bade Mr. Sharp and Tom good-by.

"Young ladies, to your rooms!" she commanded. "You have learned enough
of airships, and there may be some danger getting this one off the
roof."

"Wouldn't you like to stay and take a ride in it?" Tom asked Miss
Nestor.

"Indeed I would," she answered daringly. "It's better than a
motor-boat. May I?"

"Some day, when we get more expert in managing it," he replied, as he
shook hands with her.

"Now for some hard work," went on the young inventor to Mr. Sharp, when
the roof was cleared of the last of the teachers and pupils. But the
windows that gave a view of the airship in its odd position on the roof
were soon filled with eager faces, while in the streets below was a
great crowd, offering all manner of suggestions.

"Oh, it's not going to be such a task," said Mr. Sharp. "First we will
repair the rudder and the machinery, and then we'll generate some more
gas, rise and fly home."

"But the broken propeller?" objected Tom.

"We can fly with one, as well as we can with two, but not so swiftly.
Don't worry. We'll come out all right," and the balloonist assumed a
confident air.

It was not so difficult a problem as Tom had imagined to put the
machinery in order, a simple break having impaired the working of the
rudder. Then the smashed propeller was unshipped and the gas machine
started. With all the pupils watching from windows, and a crowd
observing from the streets and surrounding country, for word of the
happening had spread, Tom and his friend prepared to ascend.

They arose as well as they had done at the shed at home, and in a
little while, were floating over the school. Tom fancied he could
observe a certain hand waving to him, as he peered from the window of
the car--a hand in one of the school casements, but where there were so
many pretty girls doing the same thing, I hardly see how Tom could pick
out any certain one, though he had extraordinarily good eyesight.
However, the airship was now afloat and, starting the motor, Mr. Sharp
found that even with one propeller the Red Cloud did fairly well,
making good speed.

"Now for home, to repair everything, and we'll be ready for a longer
trip," the aeronaut said to the young inventor, as they turned around,
and headed off before the wind, while hundreds below them cheered.

"We ought to carry spare propellers if we're going to smash into school
towers," remarked Tom. "I seem to be a sort of hoodoo."

"Nonsense! It wasn't your fault at all," commented Mr. Sharp warmly.
"It would have happened to me had I been steering. But we will take an
extra propeller along after this."

An hour later they arrived in front of the big shed and the Red Cloud
was safely housed. Mr. Swift was just beginning to get anxious about
his son and his friend, and was glad to welcome them back.

"Now for a big trip, in about a week!" exclaimed Mr. Sharp
enthusiastically. "You'll come with us, won't you, Mr. Swift?"

The inventor slowly shook his head.

"Not on a trip," he said. "I may go for a trial spin with you, but I've
got too important a matter under way to venture on a long trip," and he
turned away without explaining what it was. But Tom and Mr. Sharp were
soon to learn.




Chapter 7

Andy Tries a Trick


Without loss of time the young inventor and the aeronaut began to
repair the damage done to the Red Cloud by colliding with the tower.
The most important part to reconstruct was the propeller, and Mr. Sharp
decided to make two, instead of one, in order to have an extra one in
case of future accidents.

Tom's task was to arrange the mechanism so that, hereafter, the rudder
could not become jammed, and so prevent the airship from steering
properly. This the lad accomplished by a simple but effective device
which, when the balloonist saw it, caused him to compliment Tom.

"That's worth patenting," he declared. "I advise you to take out papers
on that."

"It seems such a simple thing," answered the youth. "And I don't see
much use of spending the money for a patent. Airships aren't likely to
be so numerous that I could make anything off that patent."

"You take my advice," insisted Mr. Sharp. "Airships are going to be
used more in the future than you have any idea of. You get that device
patented."

Tom did so, and, not many years afterward he was glad that he had, as
it brought him quite an income.

It required several days' work on the Red Cloud before it was in shape
for another trial. During the hours when he was engaged in the big
shed, helping Mr. Sharp, the young inventor spent many minutes calling
to mind the memory of a certain fair face, and I think I need not
mention any names to indicate whose face it was.

"She promised to go for a ride with me," mused the lad. "I hope she
doesn't back out. But I'll want to learn more about managing the ship
before I venture with her in it. It won't do to have any accidents
then. There's Ned Newton, too. I must take him for a skim in the
clouds. Guess I'll invite him over some afternoon, and give him a
private view of the machine, when we get it in shape again."

About a week after the accident at the school Mr. Sharp remarked to Tom
one afternoon:

"If the weather is good to-morrow, we'll try another flight. Do you
suppose your father will come along?"

"I don't know," answered the lad. "He seems much engrossed in
something. It's unusual, too, for he most generally tells me what he is
engaged upon. However, I guess he will say something about it when he
gets ready."

"Well, if he doesn't feel just like coming, don't argue him. He might
be nervous, and, while the ship is new, I don't want any nervous
passengers aboard. I can't give them my attention and look after the
running of the machinery."

"I was going to propose bringing a friend of mine over to see us make
the trip to-morrow," went on the young inventor. "Ned Newton, you know
him. He'd like a ride."

"Oh, I guess Ned's all right. Let him come along. We won't go very high
to-morrow. After a trial rise by means of the gas, I'm going to lower
the ship to the ground, and try for an elevation by means of the
planes. Oh, yes, bring your friend along."

Ned Newton was delighted the next day to receive Tom's invitation, and,
though a little dubious about trusting himself in an airship for the
first time, finally consented to go with his chum. He got a half
holiday from the bank, and, shortly after dinner went to Tom's house.

"Come on out in the shed and take a look at the Red Cloud," proposed
the young inventor. "Mr. Sharp isn't quite ready to start yet, and I'll
explain some things to you."

The big shed was deserted when the lads entered, and went to the loft
where they were on a level with the big, red aluminum tank. Tom began
with a description of the machinery, and Ned followed him with interest.

"Now we'll go down into the car or cabin," continued the young
navigator of the air, "and I'll show you what we do when we're touring
amid the clouds."

As they started to descend the flight of steps from the loft platform,
a noise on the ground below attracted their attention.

"Guess that's Mr. Sharp coming," said Ned.

Tom leaned over and looked down. An instant later he grasped the arm of
his chum, and motioned to him to keep silent.

"Take a look," whispered the young inventor.

"Andy Foger!" exclaimed Ned, peering over the railing.

"Yes, and Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey are with him. They sneaked in
when I left the door open. Wonder what they want?"

"Up to some mischief, I'll wager," commented Ned. "Hark! They're
talking."

The two lads on the loft listened intently. Though the cronies on the
ground below them did not speak loudly, their voices came plainly to
the listeners.

"Let's poke a hole in their gas bag," proposed Sam. "That will make
them think they're not so smart as they pretend."

"Naw, we can't do that," answered Andy.

"Why not?" declared Pete.

"Because the bag's away up in the top part of the shed, and I'm not
going to climb up there."

"You're afraid," sneered Sam.

"I am not! I'll punch your face if you say that again! Besides the
thing that holds the gas is made of aluminum, and we can't make a hole
in it unless we take an axe, and that makes too much noise."

"We ought to play some sort of a trick on Tom Swift," proposed Pete.
"He's too fresh!"

Tom shook his fist at the lads on the ground, but of course they did
not see him.

"I have it!" came from Andy.

"What?" demanded his two cronies.

"We'll cut some of the guy wires from the planes and rudders. That will
make the airship collapse. They'll think the wires broke from the
strain. Take out your knives and saw away at the wires. Hurry, too, or
they may catch us."

"You're caught now," whispered Ned to Tom. "Come on down, and give 'em
a trouncing."

Tom hesitated. He looked quickly about the loft, and then a smile
replaced the frown of righteous anger on his face.

"I have a better way," he said.

"What is it?"

"See that pile of dirt?" and he pointed to some refuse that had been
swept up from the floor of the loft. Ned nodded. "It consists of a lot
of shavings, sawdust and, what's more, a lot of soot and lampblack that
we used in mixing some paint. We'll sweep the whole pile down on their
heads, and make them wish they'd stayed away from this place."

"Good!" exclaimed Ned, chuckling. "Give me a broom. There's another one
for you."

The two lads in the loft peered down. The red-headed, squint-eyed bully
and his chums had their knives out, and were about to cut some of the
important guy wires, when, at a signal from Tom, Ned, with a sweep of
his broom, sent a big pile of the dirt, sawdust and lampblack down upon
the heads of the conspirators. The young inventor did the same thing,
and for an instant the lower part of the shed looked as if a dirtstorm
had taken place there. The pile of refuse went straight down on the
heads of the trio, and, as they were looking up, in order to see to cut
the wires, they received considerable of it in their faces.

In an instant the white countenances of the lads were changed to
black--as black as the burnt-cork performers in a minstrel show. Then
came a series of howls.

"Wow! Who did that!"

"I'm blinded! The shed is falling down!"

"Run fellows, run!" screamed Andy. "There's been an explosion. We'll be
killed!"

At that moment the big doors of the shed were thrown open, and Mr.
Sharp came in. He started back in astonishment at the sight of the
three grotesque figures, their faces black with the soot, and their
clothes covered with sawdust and shavings, rushing wildly around.

"That will teach you to come meddling around here. Andy Foger!" cried
Tom.

"I--I--you--you--Oh, wait--I--you--" spluttered the bully, almost
speechless with rage. Sam and Pete were wildly trying to wipe the stuff
from their faces, but only made matters worse. They were so startled
that they did not know enough to run out of the opened doors.

"Wish we had some more stuff to put on 'em," remarked Ned, who was
holding his sides that ached from laughter.

"I have it!" cried Tom, and he caught up a bucket of red paint, that
had been used to give the airship its brilliant hue. Running to the end
of the loft Tom stood for an instant over the trio of lads who were
threatening and imploring by 'turns.

"Here's another souvenir of your visit," shouted the young inventor, as
he dashed the bucket of red paint down on the conspirators. This
completed the work of the dirt and soot, and a few seconds later, each
face looking like a stage Indian's ready for the war-path, the trio
dashed out. They shed shavings, sawdust and lampblack at every step,
and from their clothes and hands and faces dripped the carmine paint.

"Better have your pictures taken!" cried Ned, peering from an upper
window.

"Yes, and send us one," added Tom, joining his chum. Andy looked up at
them. He dug a mass of red paint from his left ear, removed a mass of
soot from his right cheek, and, shaking his fist, which was alternately
striped red and black, cried out in a rage:

"I'll get even with you yet, Tom Swift!"

"You only got what was coming to you," retorted the young inventor.
"The next time you come sneaking around this airship, trying to damage
it, you'll get worse, and I'll have you arrested. You've had your
lesson, and don't forget it."

The red-haired bully, doubly red-haired now, had nothing more to say.
There was nothing he could say, and, accompanied by his companions, he
made a bee-line for the rear gate in the fence, and darted across the
meadow. They were all sorry enough looking specimens, but solely
through their own fault.




Chapter 8

Winning a Prize


"Well, Tom, what happened?" asked Mr. Sharp, as he saw the trio running
away. "Looks as if you had had an exciting time here."

"No, those fellows had all the excitement," declared Ned. "We had the
fun." And the two lads proceeded to relate what had taken place.

"Tried to damage the airship, eh?" asked Mr. Sharp. "I wish I'd caught
them at it; the scoundrels! But perhaps you handled them as well as I
could have done."

"I guess so," assented Tom. "I must see if they did cut any of the
wires."

But the young inventor and his chum had acted too quickly, and it was
found that nothing had been done to the Red Cloud.

A little later the airship was taken out of the shed, and made ready
for a trip. The gas ascension was first used, and Ned and Mr. Swift
were passengers with Tom and Mr. Sharp. The machine went about a
thousand feet up in the air, and then was sent in various directions,
to the no small delight of a large crowd that gathered in the meadow
back of the Swift property; for it only required the sight of the
airship looming its bulk above the fence and buildings, to attract a
throng. It is safe to say this time, however, that Andy Foger and his
cronies were not in the audience. They were probably too busy removing
the soot and red paint.

Although it was the first time Mr. Swift had ever been in an airship,
he evinced no great astonishment. In fact he seemed to be thinking
deeply, and on some subject not connected with aeronautics. Tom noticed
the abstraction of his father, and shook his head. Clearly the aged
inventor was not his usual self.

As for Ned Newton his delight knew no bounds, At first he was a bit
apprehensive as the big ship went higher and higher, and swung about,
but he soon lost his fear, and enjoyed the experience as much as did
Tom. The young inventor was busy helping Mr. Sharp manage the
machinery, rudders-planes and motor.

A flight of several miles was made, and Tom was wishing they might pay
another visit to the Rocksmond Seminary, but Mr. Sharp, after
completing several evolutions, designed to test the steering qualities
of the craft, put back home.

"We'll land in the meadow and try rising by the planes alone," he said.
In this evolution it was deemed best for Mr. Swift and Ned to alight,
as there was no telling just how the craft would behave. Tom's father
was very willing to get out, but Ned would have remained in, only for
the desire of his friend.

With the two propellers whirring at a tremendous speed, and all the gas
out of the aluminum container, the Red Cloud shot forward, running over
the level ground of the meadow, where a starting course had been laid
out.

"Clear the track!" cried Mr. Sharp, as he saw the crowd closing up in
front of him. The men, boys, several girls and women made a living
lane. Through this shot the craft, and then, when sufficient momentum
had been obtained, Tom, at a command from the aeronaut, pulled the
lever of the elevation rudder. Up into the air shot the nose of the Red
Cloud as the wind struck the slanting surface of the planes, and, a
moment later it was sailing high above the heads of the throng.

"That's the stuff!" cried Mr. Sharp. "It works as well that way as it
does with the gas!"

Higher and higher it went, and then, coming to a level keel, the craft
was sent here and there, darting about like a bird, and going about in
huge circles.

"Start the gas machine, and we'll come to rest in the air," said the
balloonist, and Tom did so. As the powerful vapor filled the container
the ship acquired a buoyancy, and there was no need of going at high
speed in order to sustain it. The propellers were stopped, and the Red
Cloud floated two thousand feet in the air, only a little distance
below some fleecy, white masses from which she took her name. The
demonstration was a great success. The gas was again allowed to escape,
the propellers set in motion, and purely as an aeroplane, the ship was
again sent forward. By means of the planes and rudders a perfect
landing was made in the meadow, a short distance from where the start
had been made. The crowd cheered the plucky youth and Mr. Sharp.

"Now I'm ready to go on a long trip any time you are, Tom," said the
aeronaut that night.

"We'll fit up the car and get ready," agreed the 'youth. "How about
you, dad?"

"Me? Oh, well--er--that is, you see; well, I'll think about it," and
Mr. Swift went to his own room, carrying with him a package of papers,
containing intricate calculations.

Tom shook his head, but said nothing. He could not understand his
father's conduct.

Work was started the next day on fitting up the car, or cabin, of the
airship, so that several persons could live, eat and sleep in it for
two weeks, if necessary. The third day after this task had been
commenced the mail brought an unusual communication to Tom and Mr.
Sharp. It was from an aero club of Blakeville, a city distant about a
hundred miles, and stated that a competition for aeroplanes and
dirigible balloons was to be held in the course of two weeks. The
affair was designed to further interest in the sport, and also to
demonstrate what progress had been made in the art of conquering the
air. Prizes were to be given, and the inventors of the Red Cloud, the
achievements of which the committee of arrangements had heard, were
invited to compete.

"Shall we go in for it, Tom?" asked the balloonist.

"I'm willing if you are."

"Then let's do it. We'll see how our craft shows up alongside of
others. I know something of this club. It is all right, but the
carnival is likely to be a small one. Once I gave a balloon exhibition
for them. The managers are all right. Well, we'll have a try at it.
Won't do us any harm to win a prize. Then for a long trip!"

As it was not necessary to have the car, or cabin, completely fitted up
in order to compete for the prize, work in that direction was suspended
for the time being, and more attention was paid to the engine, the
planes and rudders. Some changes were made and, a week later the Red
Cloud departed for Blakeville. As the rules of the contest required
three passengers, Ned Newton was taken along, Mr. Swift having arranged
with the bank president so that the lad could have a few days off.

The Red Cloud arrived at the carnival grounds in the evening, having
been delayed on the trip by a broken cog wheel, which was mended in
mid-air. As the three navigators approached, they saw a small machine
flying around the grounds.

"Look!" cried Ned excitedly. "What a small airship."

"That's a monoplane," declared Tom, who was getting to be quite an
expert.

"Yes, the same kind that was used to cross the English Channel,"
interjected Mr. Sharp. "They're too uncertain for my purposes, though;
they are all right under certain conditions."

Hardly had he spoken than a puff of wind caused the daring manipulator
of the monoplane to swerve to one side. He had to make a quick
descent--so rapid was it, in fact, that the tips of one of his planes
was smashed.

"It'll take him a day to repair that," commented the aeronaut dryly.

The Red Cloud created a sensation as she slowly settled down in front
of the big tent assigned to her. Tom's craft was easily the best one at
the carnival, so far, though the managers said other machines were on
the way.

The exhibition opened the next day, but no flights were to be attempted
until the day following. Two more crafts arrived, a large triplane, and
a dirigible balloon. There were many visitors to the ground, and Tom,
Ned and Mr. Sharp were kept busy answering questions put by those who
crowded into their tent. Toward the close of the day a fussy little
Frenchman entered, and, making his way to where Tom stood, asked:

"Air you ze ownair of zis machine?"

"One of them," replied the lad.

"Ha! Sacre! Zen I challenge you to a race. I have a monoplane zat is ze
swiftest evaire! One thousand francs will I wager you, zat I can fly
higher and farther zan you."

"Shall we take him up, Mr. Sharp?" asked Tom.

"We'll race with him, after we get through with the club entries,"
decided the aeronaut. "But not for money. It's against my principles,
and I don't believe your father would like it. Racing for prizes is a
different thing."

"Well, we will devote ze money to charity," conceded the Frenchman.
This was a different matter, and one to which Mr. Sharp did not object,
so it was arranged that a trial should take place after the regular
affairs.

That night was spent in getting the Red Cloud in shape for the contests
of the next day. She was "groomed" until every wire was taut and every
cog, lever and valve working perfectly. Ned Newton helped all he could.
So much has appeared in the newspapers of the races at Blakeville that
I will not devote much space here to them. Suffice it to say that the
Red Cloud easily distanced the big dirigible from which much was
expected. It was a closer contest with the large triplane, but Tom's
airship won, and was given the prize, a fine silver cup.

As the carnival was a small one, no other craft in a class with the Red
Cloud had been entered, so Tom and Mr. Sharp had to be content with the
one race they won. There were other contests among monoplanes and
biplanes, and the little Frenchman won two races.

"Now for ze affaire wis ze monstaire balloon of ze rouge color!" he
cried, as he alighted from his monoplane while an assistant filled the
gasolene tank. "I will in circles go around you, up and down, zis side
zen ze ozzer, and presto! I am back at ze starting place, before you
have begun. Zen charity shall be ze richair!"

"All right, wait and see," said Tom, easily. But, though he showed much
confidence he asked Mr. Sharp in private, just before the impromptu
contest: "Do you think we can beat him?"

"Well," said the aeronaut, shrugging his shoulders, "you can't tell
much about the air. His machine certainly goes very fast, but too much
wind will be the undoing of him, while it will only help us. And I
think," he added, "that we're going to get a breeze."

It was arranged that the Red Cloud would start from the ground, without
the use of the gas, so as to make the machines more even. At the signal
off they started, the motors making a great racket. The monoplane with
the little Frenchman in the seat got up first.

"Ah, ha!" he cried gaily, "I leave you in ze rear! Catch me if you can!"

"Don't let him beat us," implored Ned.

"Can't you speed her up any more?" inquired Tom of Mr. Sharp.

The aeronaut nodded grimly, and turned more gasolene into the
twenty-cylindered engine. Like a flash the Red Cloud darted forward.
But the Frenchman also increased his speed and did, actually, at first,
circle around the bigger machine, for his affair was much lighter. But
when he tried to repeat that feat he found that he was being left
behind.

"That's the stuff! We're winning!" yelled Tom, Ned joining in the shout.

Then came a puff of wind. The monoplane had to descend, for it was in
danger of turning turtle. Still the navigator was not going to give up.
He flew along at a lower level. Then Mr. Sharp opened up the Red
Cloud's engine at full speed, and it was the big machine which now
sailed around the other.

"I protest! I protest!" cried the Frenchman, above the explosions of
his motor. "Ze wind is too strong for me!"

Mr. Sharp said nothing, but, with a queer smile on his face he sent the
airship down toward the earth. A moment later he was directly under the
monoplane. Then, quickly rising, he fairly caught the Frenchman's
machine on top of a square platform of the gas container, the bicycle
wheels of the monoplane resting on the flat surface. And, so swiftly
did the Red Cloud fly along that it carried the monoplane with it, to
the chagrin of the French navigator.

"A trick! A trick!" he cried. "Eet is not fair!"

Then, dropping down, Mr. Sharp allowed the monoplane to proceed under
its own power, while he raced on to the finish mark, winning, of
course, by a large margin.

"Ha! A trick! I race you to-morrow and again to-morrow!" cried the
beaten Frenchman as he alighted.

"No, thanks," answered Tom. "We've had enough. I guess charity will be
satisfied."

The little Frenchman was a good loser, and paid over the money, which
was given to the Blakeville Hospital, the institution receiving it
gladly.

At the request of the carnival committee, Mr. Sharp and Tom gave an
exhibition of high and long flights the next day, and created no little
astonishment by their daring feats.

"Well, I think we have reason to be proud of our ship," remarked Mr.
Sharp that night. "We won the first contest we were ever in, and beat
that speedy monoplane, which was no small thing to do, as they are very
fast."

"But wait until we go on our trip," added Tom, as he looked at the cup
they had won. He little realized what danger they were to meet with in
the flight that was before them.




Chapter 9

The Runaway Auto


Had the inventors of the Red Cloud desired, they could have made
considerable money by giving further exhibitions at the Blakeville Aero
Carnival, and at others which were to be held in the near future at
adjoining cities. The fame of the new machine had spread, and there
were many invitations to compete for prizes.

But Tom and Mr. Sharp wished to try their skill in a long flight, and
at the close of the Blakeville exhibition they started for Shopton,
arriving there without mishap, though Tom more than half hoped that
they might happen to strike the tower of a certain school. I needn't
specify where.

The first thing to be done was to complete the fitting-up of the car,
or cabin. No berths had, as yet, been put in, and these were first
installed after the Red Cloud was in her shed. Then an electrical
heating and cooking apparatus was fitted in; some additional machinery,
tanks for carrying water, and chemicals for making the gas, boxes of
provisions, various measuring instruments and other supplies were put
in the proper places, until the cabin was filled almost to its
capacity. Of course particular attention had been paid to the ship
proper, and every portion was gone over until Mr. Sharp was sure it was
in shape for a long flight.

"Now the question is," he said to Tom one evening, "who shall we take
with us? You and I will go, of course, but I'd like one more. I wonder
if your father can't be induced to accompany us? He seemed to like the
trial trip."

"I'll ask him to-morrow," said the lad. "He's very busy to-night. If he
doesn't care about it, maybe Garret Jackson will go."

"I'm afraid not. He's too timid."

"I'd like to take Ned Newton, but he can't get any more time away from
the bank. I guess we'll have to depend on dad."

But, to the surprise of Tom and Mr. Sharp, the aged inventor shook his
head when the subject was broached to him next day.

"Why won't you go, dad?" asked his son.

"I'll tell you," replied Mr. Swift. "I was keeping it a secret until I
had made some advance in what I am engaged upon. But I don't want to go
because I am on the verge of perfecting a new apparatus for submarine
boats. It will revolutionize travel under the water, and I don't want
to leave home until I finish it. There is another point to be
considered. The government has offered a prize for an under-water boat
of a new type, and I wish to try for it."

"So that's what you've been working on, eh, dad?" asked his son.

"That's it, and, much as I should like to accompany you, I don't feel
free to go. My mind would be distracted, and I need to concentrate
myself on this invention. It will produce the most wonderful results,
I'm sure. Besides, the government prize is no small one. It is fifty
thousand dollars for a successful boat."

Mr. Swift told something more about his submarine, but, as I expect to
treat of that in another book, I will not dwell on it here, as I know
you are anxious to learn what happened on the trip of the Red Cloud.

"Well," remarked Mr. Sharp, somewhat dubiously, "I wonder who we can
get to go? We need someone besides you and I, Tom."

"I s'pose I could get Eradicate Sampson, and his mule Boomerang,"
replied the lad with a smile. "Yet I don't know--"

At that instant there was a tremendous racket outside. The loud puffing
of an automobile could be heard, but mingled with it was the crash of
wood, and then the whole house seemed jarred and shaken.

"Is it an earthquake?" exclaimed Mr. Swift, springing to his feet, and
rushing to the library windows.

"Something's happened!" cried Tom.

"Maybe an explosion of the airship gas!" yelled Mr. Sharp, making ready
to run to the balloon shed. But there was no need. The crashing of wood
ceased, and, above the puffing of an auto could be heard a voice
exclaiming:

"Bless my very existence! Bless my cats and dogs! Good gracious! But I
never meant to do this!"

Tom, his father and Mr. Sharp rushed to the long, low windows that
opened on the veranda. There, on the porch, which it had mounted by way
of the steps, tearing away part of the railing, was a large touring
car; and, sitting at the steering wheel, in a dazed sort of manner, was
Mr. Wakefield Damon.

"Bless my shirt studs!" he went on feebly. "But I have done it now!"

"What's the matter?" cried Tom, hastening up to him. "What happened?
Are you hurt?"

"Hurt? Not a bit of it! Bless my moonstone!  It's the most lucky escape
I ever had! But I've damaged your porch, and I haven't done my machine
any good. Do you see anything of another machine chasing me?"

Tom looked puzzled, but glanced up and down the road. Far down the
highway could be discerned a cloud of dust, and, from the midst of it
came a faint "chug-chug."

"Looks like an auto down there," he said.

"Thank goodness! Bless my trousers, but I've escaped 'em!" cried the
eccentric man from whom Tom had purchased his motor-cycle.

"Escaped who?" asked Mr. Swift.

"Those men. They were after me. But I may as well get out and explain.
Dear me! However will I ever get my car off your porch?" and Mr. Damon
seemed quite distressed.

"Never mind," answered Tom. "We can manage that. Tell us what happened."

"Exactly," replied Mr. Damon, growing calmer, "Bless my shoe buttons,
but I had a fright, two of them, in fact.

"You see," he went on, "I was out partly on pleasure and partly on
business. The pleasure consisted in riding in my auto, which my
physician recommended for my health. The business consisted in bringing
to the Shopton Bank a large amount of cash. Well, I deposited it all
right, but, as I came out I saw some men hanging around. I didn't like
their looks, and I saw them eyeing me rather sharply. I thought I had
seen them before and, sure enough I had. Two of the men belonged to
that Happy Harry gang!"

Tom made a quick motion of a caution, pointing to his father, but it
was not necessary, as Mr. Swift was absently-mindedly calculating on a
piece of paper he had taken from his pocket, and had not heard what Mr.
Damon said. The latter, however, knew what Tom meant, and went on.

"Well, I didn't like the looks of these men, and when I saw them sizing
me up, evidently thinking I had drawn money out instead of putting it
in, I decided to give them the slip. I got in my auto, but I was
startled to see them get in their car. I headed for here, as I was
coming to pay you a visit, anyhow, and the mysterious men kept after
me. It became a regular race. I put on all the speed I could and headed
for your house, Tom, for I thought you would help me. I went faster and
faster, and so did they. They were almost up to me, and I was just
thinking of slowing down to turn in here, when I lost control of my
machine, and--well, I did turn in here, but not exactly as I intended.
Bless my gaiters! I came in with rather more of a rush than I expected.
It was awful--positively awful, I assure you. You've no idea how
nervous I was. But I escaped those scoundrels, for they rushed on when
they saw what I had done--smashed the porch railing."

"Probably they thought you'd smash them," observed Tom with a laugh.
"But why did they follow you?"

"Can't imagine! Haven't the least idea. Bless my spark-plug, but they
might have imagined I had money. Anyhow I'm glad I escaped them!"

"It's lucky you weren't hurt," said Mr. Sharp.

"Oh, me? Bless my existence! I'm always having narrow escapes." Mr.
Damon caught sight of the Red Cloud which was out in front of the big
shed. "Bless my heart! What's that?" he added.

"Our new airship," answered Tom proudly. "We are just planning a long
trip in it, but we can't find a third member of the party to go along."

"A third member!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Do you really mean it?"

"We do."

"Bless my shoe laces! Will you take me along?"

"Do you mean that?" asked Tom in turn, foreseeing a way out of their
difficulties.

"I certainly do," answered the eccentric man. "I am much interested in
airships, and I might as well die up in the clouds as any other way.
Certainly I prefer it to being smashed up in an auto. Will you take me?"

"Of course!" cried Tom heartily, and Mr. Sharp nodded an assent. Then
Tom drew Mr. Damon to one side. "We'll arrange the trip in a few
minutes," the lad said. "Tell me more about those mysterious men,
please."




Chapter 10

A Bag of Tools


Wakefield Damon glanced at Mr. Swift. The inventor was oblivious to his
surroundings, and was busy figuring away on some paper. He seemed even
to have forgotten the presence of the eccentric autoist.

"I don't want father to hear about the men," went on Tom, in a low
tone. "If he hears that Happy Harry and his confederates are in this
vicinity, he'll worry, and that doesn't agree with him. But are you
sure the men you saw are the same ones who stole the turbine model?"

"Very certain," replied Mr. Damon. "I had a good view of them as I came
from the bank, and I was surprised to see them, until I remembered that
they were out of jail."

"But why do you think they pursued you?"

"Bless my eyes! I can't say. Perhaps they weren't after me at all. I
may have imagined it, but they certainly hurried off in their auto as
soon as I left the bank, after leaving my money there. I'm glad I
deposited it before I saw them. I was so nervous, as it was, that I
couldn't steer straight. It's too bad, the way I've damaged your house."

"That doesn't matter. But how about the trip in the airship? I hope you
meant it when you said you would go."

"Of course I did. I've never traveled in the air, but it can't be much
worse than my experience with my motor-cycle and the auto. At least I
can't run up any stoop, can I?" and Mr. Damon looked at Mr. Sharp.

"No," replied the aeronaut, as he scratched his head, "I guess you'll
be safe on that score. But I hope you won't get nervous when we reach a
great height."

"Oh, no. I'll just calm myself with the reflection that I can't die but
once," and with this philosophical reflection Mr. Damon went back to
look at the auto, which certainly looked odd, stuck up on the veranda.

"Well, you'd better make arrangements to go with us then," went on Tom.
"Meanwhile I'll see to getting your car down. You'll want to send it
home, I suppose?"

"No, not if you'll keep it for me. The fact is that all my folks are
away, and will be for some time. I don't have to go home to notify
them, and it's a good thing, as my wife is very nervous, and might
object, if she heard about the airship. I'll just stay here, if you've
no objection, until the Red Cloud sails, if sails is the proper term."

"'Sails' will do very well," answered Mr. Sharp. "But, Tom, let's see
if you and I can't get that car down. Perhaps Mr. Damon would like to
go in the house and talk to your father," for Mr. Swift had left the
piazza.

The eccentric individual was glad enough not to be on hand when his car
was eased down from the veranda and disappeared into the house.  Tom
and Mr. Sharp, with the aid of Garret Jackson, then released the auto
from its position. They had to take down the rest of the broken
railing, and their task was easy enough. The machine was stored in a
disused shed, and Mr. Damon had no further concern until it was time to
undertake the trip through the air.

"It will fool those men if I mysteriously disappear," he said, with a
smile. "Bless my hat band, but they'll wonder what became of me. We'll
just slip off in the Red Cloud, and they'll never be the wiser."

"I don't know about that," commented Tom. "I fancy they are keeping
pretty close watch in this vicinity, and I don't like it. I'm afraid
they are up to some mischief. I should think the bank authorities would
have them locked upon suspicion. I think I'll telephone Ned about it."

He did so, and his chum, in turn, notified the bank watchman. But the
next day it was reported that no sign of the men had been seen, and,
later it was learned that an auto, answering the description of the one
they were in, had been seen going south, many miles from Shopton.

The work of preparing the Red Cloud for the long trip was all but
completed. It had been placed back in the shed while a few more
adjustments were made to the machinery.

"Bless my eyelashes!" exclaimed Mr. Damon, a few days before the one
set for the start, "but I haven't asked where we are bound for. Where
are we going, anyhow, Mr. Sharp?"

"We're going to try and reach Atlanta, Georgia," replied the
balloonist. "That will make a fairly long trip, and the winds at this
season are favorable in that direction."

"That suits me all right," declared Mr. Damon. "I'm all ready and
anxious to start."

It was decided to give the airship a few more trials around Shopton
before setting out, to see how it behaved with the car heavier loaded
than usual. With this in view a trip was made to Rocksmond, with Mr.
Swift, Mr. Damon and Ned, in addition to Mr. Sharp and Tom, on board.
Then, at Tom's somewhat blushing request, a stop was made near the
Seminary, and, when the pupils came trooping out, the young inventor
asked Miss Nestor if she didn't want to take a little flight. She
consented, and with two pretty companions climbed rather hesitatingly
into the car. No great height was attained, but the girls were fully
satisfied and, after their first alarm really enjoyed the spin in the
air, with Tom proudly presiding at the steering wheel, which Mr. Sharp
relinquished to the lad, for he understood Tom's feelings.

Three days later all was in readiness for the trip to Atlanta. Mr.
Swift was earnestly invited to undertake it, both Tom and Mr. Sharp
urging him, but the veteran inventor said he must stay at home, and
work on his submarine plans.

The evening before the start, when the aeronaut and Tom were giving a
final inspection to the craft in the big shed, Mr. Sharp exclaimed "I
declare Tom, I believe you'll have to take a run into town."

"What for?"

"Why to get that kit of special tools I ordered, which we might need to
make repairs. There are some long-handled wrenches, some spare levers,
and a couple of braces and bits. Harrison, the hardware dealer, ordered
them for me from New York, and they were to be ready this afternoon,
but I forgot them. Take an empty valise with you, and you can carry
them on your motorcycle. I'm sorry to have forgotten it, but--"

"That's all right, Mr. Sharp, I'd just as soon go as not. It will make
the time pass more quickly. I'll start right off."

An hour later, having received the tools, which made quite a bundle,
the lad put them in the valise, and started back toward home. As he
swung around the corner on which the bank was located--the same bank in
which Ned Newton worked--one of the valves on the motor-cycle began to
leak. Tom dismounted to adjust it, and had completed the work, being
about to ride on, when down the street came Andy Foger and Sam
Snedecker. They started at the sight of our hero.

"There he is now!" exclaimed Sam, as if he and the red-haired bully had
been speaking of the young inventor.

"Let's lick him!" proposed Andy. "Now's our chance to get even for
throwing that paint and soot on us."

Tom heard their words. He was not afraid of both the lads, for, though
each one matched him in size and strength, Tom knew they were cowards.

"If you're looking for anything I guess I can accommodate you," he
said, coolly.

"Come on, Andy," urged Sam. But, somehow Andy hung back. Perhaps he
didn't like the way Tom squared off. The young inventor had let down
the rear brace of his motor-cycle, and was not obliged to hold it, so
he had both hands free.

"We ought to lick him good and proper," growled the squint-eyed lad.

"Well, why don't you?" invited Tom.

He moved to one side, so as not to be hampered by his wheel. As he did
so he knocked from the handle bars the valise of tools. They fell with
a clatter and a thud to the pavement, and the satchel came open. It was
under a gas lamp, and the glitter of the long-handled wrenches and
other implements caught the eyes of Andy and his crony.

"Huh! If we fought you, maybe you'd use some of them on us," sneered
Andy, glad of an excuse not to fight.

Tom quickly picked up his valise, shutting it, but he was aware of the
close scrutiny of the two vindictive lads.

"I don't fight with such things," he said, somewhat annoyed, and he
hung the tools back on the handle bars.

"What you doing around the bank at this hour?" asked Sam, as if to
change the subject. "First thing you know the watchman will order you
to move on. He might think you were a suspicious character."

"The same to you," retorted Tom, "but I'm going to ride on now, unless
you want to have a further argument with me."

"You'd better be careful how you hang around a bank," added Andy. "The
police are on the lookout here. There's been some mysterious men seen
about."

Tom did not care to go into that, and, seeing that the two bullies had
lost all desire to attack him, he put up the brace and mounted his
wheel.

"Good-by," he called to Andy and Sam, as he rode off, the tools
rattling and jingling in the valise, but it was a sarcastic farewell,
and the two cronies did not reply.

"I hope I didn't damage any of the tools when I let them fall that
time," mused the young inventor. "My, the way Sam and Andy stared at
them it would make it seem as if I had a lot of weapons in the bag!
They certainly took good note of them."

The time was to come, and very shortly, when Andy's and Sam's
observation of the tools was to prove disastrous for our hero. As Tom
turned the corner he looked back, and saw, still standing in front of
the bank, the two cronies.




Chapter 11

The Red Cloud Departs


"Well, dad, I wish you were going along with us," said Tom to his
father next morning. "You don't know what you're going to miss. A fine
trip of several hundred miles through the air, seeing strange sights,
and experiencing new sensations."

"Yes, I wish you would reconsider your determination, and accompany
us," added Mr. Damon. "I would enjoy your company."

"There's plenty of room. We can carry six persons with ease," said Mr.
Sharp.

Mr. Swift shook his head, and smiled.

"I have too much work to do here at home," he replied. "Perhaps I may
astonish you with something when you come back. I have nearly perfected
my latest invention."

There was no combating such a resolution as this, and Tom and the
others considered the decision of the aged inventor as final. The
airship was ready for the start, and every one had arisen earlier than
usual on this account. The bag of tools, for which Tom had gone to
town, were put in their proper place, the last of the supplies were
taken abroad, final tests were made of the various apparatus, the motor
had been given a trial spin, disconnected from the propellers, and then
the balloonist announced:

"Well, Tom and Mr. Damon, you had better begin to think of starting.
We've had breakfast here, but there's no telling where we will eat
dinner."

"Bless my soul! Don't you talk that way!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "You
make me exceedingly nervous. Why shouldn't we know where we are going
to eat dinner?"

"Oh, I meant we couldn't tell over just what part of the United States
we would be when dinner time came," explained the aeronaut.

"Oh, that's different. Bless my pocket knife, but I thought you meant
we might be dashed to pieces, and incapable of eating any dinner."

"Hardly," remarked Mr. Sharp. "The Red Cloud is not that kind of an
airship, I hope. But get aboard, if you please."

Tom and Mr. Damon entered the car. It was resting on the ground, on the
small wheels used to start the airship when the gas inflation method
was not used. In this case, however, it had been decided to rise in the
air by means of the powerful vapor, and not to use the wings and planes
until another time. Consequently the ship was swaying slightly, and
tugging at the restraining cables.

As Tom and Mr. Damon entered the cabin there drove into the Swift yard
a dilapidated wagon, drawn by a bony mule, and it did not need the
addition of a colored man's voice, calling: "Whoa, dar, Boomerang!" to
tell Tom that his friend Eradicate Sampson was on hand. As for
Eradicate, as soon as he saw the great airship, which he had never
before beheld fully rigged, all ready for a flight, his eyes became big
with wonder.

"Is dat yo' flyin' machine, Mistah Swift?" he asked.

"That's it, Rad," answered Tom. "Don't you want to come and take a ride
with us?"

"Me? Good land a' massy! No indeedy, Mistah Swift," and the
whitewasher, who had descended from his wagon, edged away, as if the
airship might suddenly put out a pair of hands and grab him. "No
indeedy I doant! I come t' do a little whitewashin' an' when I do dat
I'se gwine on mah way. But dat's a pow'ful fine ship; it suah am!"

"Better come and try a flight, Rad," added Mr. Damon. "I'll look after
you."

"No, sah, an' I doan't take it kind ob yo' all t' tempt me dat way,
nuther," spoke Eradicate. But, when he saw that the craft was
stationary, he ventured to approach closer. Gingerly he put out one
hand and touched the framework of the wheels, just forward of the
cabin. The negro grasped the timber, and lifted it slightly. To his
astonishment the whole front of the airship tilted up, for it was about
ready to fly, and a child might have lifted it, so buoyant was it. But
Eradicate did not know this. Wonderingly he looked at the great bulk of
the ship, looming above him, then he glanced at his arm.  Once more,
noting that the attention of his friends was elsewhere, he lifted the
craft. Then he cried "Look yeah, Mistah Swift! Look yeah!  No wonder
day calls me Sampson. I done lifted dis monstrousness airship wif one
hand, See, I kin do it! I kin do it!"

Once more he raised the Red Cloud slightly, and a delighted grin, not
unmixed with a look of awe, spread over his honest countenance.

"I suppose you'll give up whitewashing and join a circus as a strong
man, now," observed Mr. Sharp, with a wink at his companions.

"Days what I will!" announced Eradicate proudly. "I neber knowed I was
dat strong, but ob course I allers knowed I had some muscle. Golly, I
must hab growed strong ober night! Now, Boomerang, yo' suah has got t'
look out fo' yo' sef. No mo' ob yo' cuttin' up capers, or I'll jest
lift you up, an' sot yo' down on yo' back, I suah will," and the negro
feeling of his biceps walked over to where the mule stood, with its
eyes closed.

"I guess you can cast off, Tom," called Mr. Sharp, as he entered the
car, having seen that everything was all right. "We'll not go up very
far at first, until Mr. Damon gets used to the thin air."

"Bless my soul, I believe I'm getting nervous," announced the eccentric
man. "Bless my liver, but I hope nothing happens."

"Nothing will happen," Mr. Sharp assured him. "Just keep calm, when it
feels as if the bottom was dropping out of everything and you'll soon
get over it. Are you casting off those ropes, Tom? Is all clear?"

"All but the bow and stern lines."

"You attend to the bow line, and I'll go to the stern," and, going over
to the gas generator, Mr. Sharp started it so as to force more vapor
into the red aluminum container. This had the effect of rendering the
airship more buoyant, and it tugged and strained harder than ever at
the ropes.

"Good-by, Tom," called Mr. Swift, reaching up to shake hands with his
son. "Drop me a line when you get a chance."

"Oh, Tom, do be careful," implored Mrs. Baggert, her kind face showing
her anxiety. "May I kiss you good-by?"

"Of course," answered the young inventor, though the motherly
housekeeper had not done this since he was a little chap. She had to
stand on a soap box, which Eradicate brought in order to reach Tom's
face, and, when she had kissed him she said:

"Oh, I'm so worried! I just know you'll be killed, risking your lives
in that terrible airship!"

"Ha! Not a very cheerful view to take, madam," observed Mr. Damon.
"Don't hold that view, I beg of you. Bless my eyelashes, but you'll see
us coming home, covered with glory and star dust."

"I'm sure I hope so," answered Mrs. Baggert, laughing a little in spite
of herself.

The last ropes were cast off. Good-bys were shouted as the airship shot
into the air, and Mr. Sharp started the motor, to warm it up before the
propellers were thrown into gear. The twenty cylinders began exploding
with a terrific racket, as the muffler was open, and Tom, looking down,
saw Boomerang awaken with a jump. The mule was so frightened that he
started off on a dead run, swinging the rickety, old wagon along behind
him.

Eradicate Sampson, who had been feeling his muscle since he discovered
what he thought was his marvelous strength, saw what was happening.

"Whoa, dar, Boomerang!" he shouted. Then, as the tailboard of the wagon
swung past him, he reached out and grabbed it. Perhaps he thought he
could bring the runaway mule up standing, but, if he did, he was
grievously disappointed. Boomerang pulled his master along the gravel
walk, and kept running in spite of Eradicate's command to "whoa, dar!"

It might have gone hard with him, had not Garret Jackson, the engineer,
running in front of Boomerang, caught the animal. Eradicate picked
himself up, and gazed sadly at his arms. The navigators of the air
could not hear what he said, but what he thought was evident to them.

Then, as Mr. Sharp deadened the explosions of the powerful motor. Tom,
looking at a gauge, noted that their height was seven hundred feet.
"High enough!" called Mr. Sharp, and it was time, for Mr. Damon, in
spite of his resolution, was getting pale.

The gas was shut off, the propellers thrown into gear, and, with a rush
the Red Cloud shot toward the south, passing over the Swift homestead,
and high above the heads of the crowd that had gathered to witness the
start. The eventful voyage of the air had begun.




Chapter 12

Some Startling News


"Well, there they go," remarked Mrs. Baggert to Mr. Swift, as she
strained her eyes toward the sky, against the blue of which the airship
was now only a large, black ball.

"Yes, and a fine start they made," replied the inventor. "I almost wish
I had accompanied them, but I must not stop work on my submarine
invention."

"I do hope nothing will happen to them," went on the housekeeper. "I
declare, though, I feel just as if something was going to happen."

"Nervousness, pure nervousness," commented Mr. Swift. "Better take a
little--er--I suppose catnip tea would be good."

"Catnip tea! The very idea!" exclaimed Mrs. Baggert. "That shows how
much you know about nervousness, Mr. Swift," and she seemed a little
indignant.

"Ha! Hum! Well, maybe catnip tea wouldn't be just the thing. But don't
worry about Tom. I'm sure he can look after himself. As for Mr. Sharp
he has made too many ascensions to run into any unnecessary danger."

"Nervous!" went on the housekeeper, who seemed to resent this state
being applied to her. "I'm sure I'm not half as nervous as that Mr.
Damon. He gives me the fidgets."

"Of course. Well, I must get back to my work," said the inventor. "Ah,
are you hurt, Eradicate?" he went on, as the colored man came back,
driving Boomerang, who had been stopped just before reaching the road.

"No, Mistah Swift, I ain't exactly damaged, but mah feelin's am suah
hurted."

"How's that?"

"Well, I thought I had growed strong in de night, when I lifted dat
airship, but when I went to stop mah mule I couldn't do it. He won't
hab no respect fo' me now."

"Oh, I wouldn't let that worry me," commented Mr. Swift, and he
explained to Eradicate how it was that he had so easily lifted the end
of the buoyant ship, which weighed very little when filled with gas.

The colored man proceeded with his work of whitewashing, the inventor
was in his library, puzzling over tables of intricate figures, and Mrs.
Baggert was in the kitchen, sighing occasionally as she thought of Tom,
whom she loved almost as a son, high in the air, when two men came up
the walk, from the street, and knocked at the side door. Mrs. Baggert,
who answered the summons, was somewhat surprised to see Chief of Police
Simonson and Constable Higby.

"They probably came to see the airship start," she thought, "but
they're too late."

"Ah, good morning, Mrs. Baggert," greeted the chief. "Is Mr. Swift and
his son about this morning?"

"Mr. Swift is in his library, but Tom is gone."

"He'll be back though, won't he?" asked Constable Higby
quickly--anxiously, Mrs. Baggert thought.

"Oh, yes," she replied. "He and--"

"Just take us to see Mr. Swift," interrupted the chief, with a look of
caution at his aide. "We'll explain matters to him."

Wondering what could be the mission of the two officers, Mrs. Baggert
led them to the library.

"It's queer," she thought, "that they don't ask something about the
airship. I suppose that was what they came for. But maybe it's about
the mysterious men who robbed Mr. Swift."

"Ah, gentlemen, what can I do for you?" asked the inventor, as he rose
to greet the officials.

"Ahem, Mr. Swift. Ahem--er--that is--well, the fact is, Mr. Swift,"
stammered the chief, "we have come upon a very painful errand."

"What's that?" cried Tom's father. "I haven't been robbed again, have
I?'

"There has been a robbery committed," spoke the constable quickly.

"But you are not the victim," interposed the chief.

"I'm glad of that," said Mr. Swift.

"Where is your son, Tom?" asked the head of the Shopton police force,
sharply.

"What do you want with him?" inquired the inventor, struck by some
strange tone in the other's voice.

"Mr. Swift," went on the chief, solemnly, "I said we came upon a very
painful errand. It is painful, as I have known Tom since he was a
little lad. But I must do my duty, no matter how painful it is. I have
a warrant for the arrest of your son, Thomas Swift, and I have come to
serve it. I need not tell you that it is your duty to give him up to
us--the representatives of the law. I call upon you to produce your
son."

Mr. Swift staggered to his feet.

"My son! You have come to arrest my son?" he stammered.

The chief nodded grimly.

"Upon what charge?" faltered the father.

"On a charge of breaking into the Shopton National Bank last night, and
stealing from the vault seventy-five thousand dollars in currency!"

"Seventy-five thousand dollars! Tom accused of robbing the bank!"
faltered Mr. Swift.

"That is the charge, and we've come to arrest him," broke in Constable
Higby.

"Where is he?" added the chief.

"This charge is false! Absolutely false!" shouted the aged inventor.

"That may be," admitted the chief shaking his head. "But the charge has
been made, and we hold the warrant. The courts will settle it. We must
now arrest Tom. Where is he?"

"He isn't here!" cried Mr. Swift, and small blame to him if there was a
note of triumph in his voice. "Tom sailed away not half an hour ago in
the airship Red Cloud! You can't arrest him!"

"He's escaped!" shouted the constable. "I told you, chief, that he was
a slippery customer, and that we'd better come before breakfast!"

"Dry up!" commanded the chief testily. "So he's foiled us, eh? Run away
when he knew we were coming? I think that looks like guilt, Mr. Swift."

"Never!" cried the inventor. "Tom would never think of robbing the
bank. Besides, he has all the money he wants. The charge is
preposterous! I demand to be confronted with the proof."

"You shall be," answered Chief Simonson vindictively. "If you will come
to the bank you can see the rifled vault, and hear the testimony of a
witness who saw your son with burglar tools in his possession last
night. We also have a warrant for Mr. Wakefield Damon. Do you know
anything of him?"

"He has gone with my son in the airship."

"Ha! The two criminals with their booty have escaped together!" cried
the chief. "But we'll nab them if we have to scour the whole country.
Come on, Higby! Mr. Swift, if you'll accompany me to the bank, I think
I can give you all the proof you want," and the officials, followed by
the amazed and grief-stricken inventor, left the house.




Chapter 13

Mr. Damon In Danger


The sensations of the voyagers in the airship, who meanwhile, were
flying along over the country surrounding Shopton, were not very
different than when they had undertaken some trial flights. In fact Mr.
Damon was a little disappointed after they had waved their farewells to
Mr. Swift and Mrs. Baggert.

"I declare I'm not at all nervous," he remarked, as he sat in an easy
chair in the enclosed car or cabin, and looked down at the earth
through the plate-glass windows in the floor.

"I thought you'd be all right once we got started," commented Mr.
Sharp. "Do you think you can stand going a trifle higher?"

"Try it," suggested the eccentric man. "Bless my watch chain, but, as I
said, I might as well die this way as any other. Hitting a cloud-bank
is easier than trying to climb a tree on a motorcycle, eh, Tom?"

"Very much so, Mr. Damon," conceded the young inventor, with a laugh.

"Oh, we'll not attempt any cloud heights for a day or two," went on Mr.
Sharp. "I want you, to gradually get used to the rarefied atmosphere,
Mr. Damon. Tom and I are getting to be old hands at it.  But, if you
think you can stand it, I'll go up about a thousand feet higher."

"Make it two thousand, while you're at it," proposed the odd character.
"Might as well take a long fall as a short one."

Accordingly, the elevation rudder was used to send the Red Cloud to a
greater height while she was still skimming along like some great bird.
Of course the desired elevation could have been obtained by forcing
more gas from the machine into the big, red container overhead, but it
was decided to be as sparing of this vapor as possible, since the
voyagers did not want to descend to get more material, in case they
used up what they had. It was just as easy to rise by properly working
the rudders, when the ship was in motion, and that was the method now
employed.

With the great propellers, fore and aft, making about a thousand
revolutions a minute the craft slanted up toward the sky.

The ship was not being run at top speed as Mr. Sharp did not care to
force it, and there was no need for haste. Long distance, rather than
high speed was being aimed at on this first important flight.

Tom was at the steering wheel, and, with his hand on the lever
controlling the elevation rudder, kept watch of the face of Mr. Damon,
occasionally noting what height the hand on the gauge registered. He
fancied he saw the cheeks of his friend growing pale, and, when a
height of thirty-five hundred feet was indicated, with a yank the young
inventor put the airship on a level keel.

"Are you distressed, Mr. Damon?" he asked.

"Ye--yes, I--I have--some--some difficulty in breathing," was the
answer.

Tom gave his friend the same advice the aeronaut had given the lad on
his first trip, and the eccentric man soon felt better.

"Bless my buttons!" he ventured to explain. "But I feel as if I had
lost several pounds of flesh, and I'm glad of it."

Mr. Sharp was busy with the motor, which needed some slight
adjustments, and Tom was in sole charge of navigating the airship. He
had lost the nervous feeling that first possessed him, and was becoming
quite an expert at meeting various currents of wind encountered in the
upper regions.

Below, the voyagers could see the earth spread out like a great map.
They could not tell their exact location now, but by calculating their
speed, which was about thirty miles an hour, Tom figured out that they
were above the town of Centreford, near where he had been attacked once
by the model thieves.

For several hours the airship kept on her way, maintaining a height of
about a mile, for when it was found that Mr. Damon could accommodate
himself to thirty-five hundred feet the elevation rudder was again
shifted to send the craft upward.

By using glasses the travelers could see crowds on the earth watching
their progress in the air, and, though airships, dirigible balloons and
aeroplanes are getting fairly common now, the appearance of one as
novel and as large as the Red Cloud could always be depended upon to
attract attention.

"Well, what do you say to something to eat?" proposed Mr. Sharp, coming
into the main cabin, from the motor compartment. "It's twelve o'clock,
though we can't hear the factory whistles up, here."

"I'm ready, any time you are," called Tom, from the pilot house.
"Shall I cook grub, Mr. Sharp?"

"No, you manage the ship, and I'll play cook. We'll not get a very
elaborate meal this time, as I shall have to pay occasional visits to
the motor, which isn't running just to suit me."

The electrical stove was set going, and some soup and beefsteak from
among the stores, was put on the fire. In spite of the fact that the
day was a warm one in October, it was quite cool in the cabin, until
the stove took off the chill. The temperature of the upper regions was
several degrees below that of the earth. At times the ship passed
through little wisps of vapor-clouds in the making.

"Isn't this wonderful!" exclaimed Mr. Damon, as he sat in an easy
chair, partaking of some of the food. "To think that I have lived to
see the day when I can take my lunch a mile in the air, with a craft
flying along like a bird. Bless my knife and fork but it certainly is
wonderful."

Mr. Sharp relieved Tom at the wheel, while the young inventor ate, and
then, with the airship heading southwest, the speed was increased a
trifle, the balloonist desiring to see what the motor could accomplish
under a heavy load.

A drop of several hundred feet was made about an hour later, and, as
this made it warmer, Mr. Damon, who was a great lover of fresh air,
decided to go out on the platform in front of the cabin. This platform,
and a similar one at the rear, was railed about, to prevent accidents.
A fine view could be had from them much better than through the floor
windows of the car.

"Be careful of the propeller," advised Tom, as his friend went outside.
"I don't believe you're tall enough to be hit by the blades, but don't
take any chances of standing on your tiptoes."

"Bless my pocket handkerchief, indeed I'll not," came the answer. "But
I think I shall wrap up my throat in the scarf I brought along. I am
subject to neuralgia, and the breeze may bring on an attack of it."

Wrapping a long, woolen scarf about his neck, the eccentric man ventured
out on the open platform. About the middle of it, but sufficiently high
to be above a person's head, was the forward propeller, whirring around
at swift speed.

Tom, with his eye on the various gauges and the compass, was steering
the airship. He glanced at Mr. Damon, who appeared to be enjoying the
view from the platform. For an instant the eyes of the lad were taken
from the form of his friend. He looked back suddenly, however, his
attention attracted by a smothered cry. He was horrified by what he saw.

Mr. Damon was leaning far over the edge of the railing, with nothing
between him and the earth a thousand feet below. He seemed to have lost
his balance and had toppled forward, being doubled up on the iron pipe
railing, his hands hanging limply over. Then, as Tom cried to Mr. Sharp
to shut off the motor, the lad saw that, hanging to the blade of the
propeller, and being whirled around in its revolutions, was a part of
Mr. Damon's red scarf.

"Hurry! Hurry, Mr. Sharp!" yelled Tom, not daring to let go the
steering wheel, for fear the ship would encounter a treacherous current
and tilt. "Hurry to Mr. Damon!"

"What's the matter?" asked the balloonist.

"He's dead--or unconscious--hanging over the railing. He seems to be
slipping! Hurry, or it will be too late!"




Chapter 14

Andy Gives The Clue


When Mr. Swift followed the chief of police and the constable to the
town hall his mind was filled with many thoughts. All his plans for
revolutionizing submarine travel, were, of course, forgotten, and he
was only concerned with the charge that had been made against his son.
It seemed incredible, yet the officers were not ones to perpetrate a
joke. The chief and constable had driven from town in a carriage, and
they now invited the inventor to ride back with them.

"Do you mean to tell me a warrant has actually been sworn out against
my son, Chief?" asked the father, when they were near the town hall.

"That's just what I mean to say, Mr. Swift, and, I'm sorry, on your
account, that I have to serve it."

"Hub! Don't look like you was goin' to serve it," remarked the
constable. "He's skipped out."

"That's all right, Higby," went on the chief. "I'll catch em both.
Even if they have escaped in an airship with their booty, I'll nab 'em.
I'll have a general alarm out all over the country in less than an
hour. They can't stay up in the air forever."

"A warrant for Tom--my son," murmured Mr. Swift, as if he could not
believe it.

"Yes, and for that Damon man, too," added the chief. "I want him as
well as Tom, and I'll get 'em."

"Would you mind letting me see the warrants?" asked the inventor, and
the official passed them over. The documents were made out in regular
form, and the complaints had been sworn to by Isaac Pendergast, the
bank president.

"I can't understand it," went on Tom's father. "Seventy-five thousand
dollars. It's incredible! Why!" he suddenly exclaimed, "it can't be
true. Just before he left, Mr. Damon--"

"Yes, what did he do?" asked the chief eagerly, thinking he might
secure some valuable evidence.

"I guess I'll say nothing until I have seen the bank president,"
replied Mr. Swift, and the official was obviously disappointed.

The inventor found Mr. Pendergast, and some other bank officials in the
town hall. The financiers were rather angry when they learned that the
accused persons had not been caught, but the chief said he would soon
have them in custody.

"In the meanwhile will you kindly explain, what this means?" asked Mr.
Swift of the president.

"You may come and look at the looted vault, if you like, Mr. Swift,"
replied Mr. Pendergast. "It was a very thorough job, and will seriously
cripple the bank."

There was no doubt that the vault had been forced open, for the locks
and bars were bent and twisted as if by heavy tools. Mr. Swift made a
careful examination, and was shown the money drawers that had been
smashed.

"This was the work of experts," he declared.

"Exactly what we think," said the president. "Of course we don't
believe your son was a professional bank robber, Mr. Swift. We have a
theory that Mr. Damon did the real work, but that Tom helped him with
the tools he had. There is no doubt about it."

"What right have you to accuse my son?" burst out the aged inventor.
"Why have you any more cause to suspect him than any other lad in town?
Why do you fix on him, and Mr. Damon? I demand to know."

"Mr. Damon's eccentric actions for a few days past, and his well-known
oddity of character make him an object of suspicion," declared the
president in judicial tones. "As for Tom, we have, I regret to say,
even better evidence against him."

"But what is it? What? Who gave you any clues to point to my son?"

"Do you really wish to know?"

"I certainly do," was the sharp reply. Mr. Swift, the police and
several bank officials were now in the president's office. The latter
pressed an electric bell, and, when a messenger answered, he said:

"Send young Foger here."

At the mention of this name, Mr. Swift started. He well knew the
red-haired bully was an enemy of his son. Andy entered, walking rather
proudly at the attention he attracted.

"This is Mr. Swift," said the president.

"Aw, I know him," blurted out Andy.

"You will please tell him what you told us," went on Mr. Pendergast.

"Well, I seen Tom Swift hanging around this bank with burglar tools in
his possession last night, just before it was robbed," exclaimed the
squint-eyed lad triumphantly.

"Hanging around the bank last night with burglar tools?" repeated Mr.
Swift, in dazed tones.

"That's right," from Andy.

"How do you know they were burglar tools?"

"Because I saw 'em!" cried Andy. "He had 'em in a valise on his
motor-cycle. He was standing at the corner, waiting for a chance to
break into the bank, and when me and Sam Snedecker saw him, he
pretended to be fixin' his machine. Then the bag of burglar tools fell
off, the satchel came open, and I seen 'em! That's how I know."

"And you're sure they were burglar tools?" asked the chief, for he
depended on Andy to be his most important witness.

"Sure I am. I seen a picture of burglar tools once, and the ones Tom
had was just like 'em. Long-handled wrenches, brace an' bits, an' all.
He tried to hide 'em, but me an' Sam was too quick for him. He wanted
to lick me, too."

"No doubt you deserved it," murmured Mr. Swift. "But how do you know my
son was waiting for a chance to break into the bank?"

"'Cause, wasn't it robbed right after he was hangin' around here with
the burglar tools?" inquired Andy, as if that was unanswerable.

"What were you hanging around here for?" Mr. Swift demanded quickly.

"Me? Oh, well, me an' Sam Snedecker was out takin' a walk. That's all."

"You didn't want to rob the bank, did you?" went on the inventor,
keenly.

"Of course not," roared the bully, indignantly. "I ain't got no burglar
tools."

Andy told more along the same line, but his testimony of having seen
Tom near the bank, with a bag of odd tools could not be shaken. In fact
it was true, as far as it went, but, of course, the tools were only
those for the airship; the same ones Mr. Sharp had sent the lad after.
Sam Snedecker was called in after Andy, and told substantially the same
story.

Mr. Swift could not understand it, for he knew nothing of Tom being
sent for the tools, and had not heard any talk at home of the bag of
implements ordered by the balloonist. Still, of course, he knew Tom had
nothing to do with the robbery, and he knew his son had been at home
all the night previous. Still this was rather negative evidence.  But
the inventor had one question yet to ask.

"You say you also suspect Mr. Damon of complicity in this affair?" he
went on, to the chief of police.

"We sure do," replied Mr. Simonson.

"Then can you explain?" proceeded the inventor, "how it is that Mr.
Damon has on deposit in this bank a large sum. Would he rob the bank
where his own funds were?"

"We are prepared for that," declared the president. "It is true that
Mr. Damon has about ten thousand dollars in our bank, but we believe he
deposited it only as a blind, so as to cover up his tracks. It is a
deep-laid scheme, and escaping in the airship is part of it. I am
sorry, Mr. Swift, that I have to believe your son and his accomplice
guilty, but I am obliged to. Chief, you had better send out a general
alarm. The airship ought to be easy to trace."

"I'll telegraph at once," said the official.

"And you believe my son guilty, solely on the testimony of these two
boys, who, as is well known, are his enemies?" asked Mr. Swift.

"The clue they gave us is certainly most important," said the
president. "Andy came to us and told what he had seen, as soon as it
became known that the bank had been robbed."

"And I'm going to get the reward for giving information of the robbers,
too!" cried the bully.

"I'm going to have my share!" insisted Sam.

"Ah, then there is a reward offered?" inquired Mr. Swift.

"Five thousand dollars," answered Mr. Pendergast. "The directors, all
of whom are present save Mr. Foger, Andy's father, met early this
morning, and decided to offer that sum."

"And I'm going to get it," announced the red-haired lad again.

Mr. Swift was much downcast. There seemed to be nothing more to say,
and, being a man unversed in the ways of the world, he did not know
what to do. He returned hone. When Mrs. Baggert was made acquainted
with the news, she waxed indignant.

"Our Tom a thief!" she cried. "Why don't they accuse me and Mr. Jackson
and you? The idea! You ought to hire a lawyer, Mr. Swift, and prosecute
those men for slander."

"Do you think it would be a good plan?"

"I certainly do. Why they have no evidence at all! What does that mean,
sneaking Andy Foger amount to? Get a lawyer, and have Tom's interests
looked after."

Mr. Swift, glad to have someone share the responsibility with, felt
somewhat better when a well-known Shopton attorney assured him that the
evidence against Tom was of such a flimsy character that it would
scarcely hold in a court of justice.

"But they have warrants for him and Mr. Damon," declared the inventor.

"Very true, but it is easy to swear out a warrant against any one.
It's a different matter to prove a person guilty."

"But they can arrest my son."

"Yes--if they catch him. However, we can soon have him released on
bail."

"It's disgraceful," said Mrs. Baggert.

"Not at all, my dear madam, not at all. Good and innocent persons have
been arrested."

"They are going to send out a general alarm for my son," bewailed Mr.
Swift.

"Yes, but I fancy it will be some time before they catch him and Mr.
Damon, if the airship holds together. I can't think of a better way to
keep out of the clutches of the police, and their silly charge,"
chuckled the lawyer. "Now don't worry, Mr. Swift. It will all come out
right."

The inventor tried to believe so, but, though he knew his son was
innocent, it was rather hard to see, within the next few days, big
posters on all the vacant walls and fences, offering a reward of five
thousand dollars for the arrest of Tom Swift and Wakefield Damon, who
were charged with having flown away in an airship with seventy-five
thousand dollars of the bank's money.

"I guess Tom Swift will wish he'd been more decent to me when I collect
that money for his arrest," said Andy to his crony, Sam, the day the
bills were posted.

"Yes, but I get my share, don't I?" asked Sam.

"Sure," answered the bully. "I wish they'd hurry up and arrest him."

Within the next few days the country was covered with posters telling
of the robbery and the reward, and police officials in cities large and
small, and in towns and villages, were notified by telegraph to arrest
and capture, at any cost the occupants of a certain large, red airship.

Mr. Swift, on the advice of his lawyer, sent several telegrams to Tom,
apprising him of what had happened. The telegraph company was asked to
rush the telegrams to the first city when word came in that the Red
Cloud had landed.




Chapter 15

Fired Upon


Tom's excited call to the aeronaut, telling of the mishap to Mr. Damon,
was answered immediately. Mr. Sharp jumped forward from the motor
compartment, and, passing on his way the electric switch, he yanked it
out, stopping the machinery, and the great propellers. Then he leaped
out on the platform.

But something else happened. Just before the accident to the eccentric
man, desiring to give a further test to the planes, the gas had been
shut off, making the airship an aeroplane instead of a dirigible
balloon. Consequently, as soon as the forward motion ceased the great
ship began falling.

"We're sinking! We're sinking!" cried Tom, forgetting for a moment that
he was not in his motor-boat.

"Slant your rudder up, and glide downward as slowly as you can!"
directed Mr. Sharp. "I'll start the engine again as soon as I rescue
him," for it was risky to venture out on the platform with the
propeller whirring, as the dangling piece of scarf might whip around
the balloonist and toss him off.

Mr. Sharp was soon at Mr. Damon's side. He saw that the man was
unconscious, whether from fright or some injury could not then be
determined. There was, however, no sign of a wound.

It was no easy task to carry, half dragging it, the heavy body of Mr.
Damon off the platform, but the aeronaut was a muscular individual, and
long hanging from a trapeze, at great heights, stood him in good stead.

He brought the unconscious man into the cabin, and then, quickly
returning to the platform, he detached the piece of scarf from the
propeller blade. Next he started the motor, and also turned on the gas
tank, so that the airship, in a few minutes, could float in space
without motion.

"You needn't steer now, Tom," said the balloonist. "Just give me a hand
here."

"Is--is he dead?" inquired the lad, his voice faltering.

"No, his heart's beating. I can't understand what happened."

Mr. Sharp was something of a rough and ready surgeon and doctor, and a
small box of medicines had been brought along in case of emergencies.
With the Red Cloud now lazily floating in the air, for, once the
falling motion had been checked by the engine, the motor had been
stopped again, Mr. Sharp set about restoring Mr. Damon to consciousness.

It was not long before the man opened his eyes. The color that had left
his cheeks came back, and, after a drink of cold water he was able to
sit up.

"Did I fall?" he asked. "Bless my very existence, but did I tumble off
the airship?"

"No indeed," replied Tom, "though you came pretty near it. How do you
feel? Were you hurt?"

"Oh, I'm all right now--just a trifle dizzy. But I thought sure I was a
goner when I fell over the platform railing," and Mr. Damon could not
repress a shudder. Mr. Sharp administered some more medicine and his
patient was soon able to stand, and move about.

"How did it happen?" inquired the balloonist.

"I hardly know," answered Mr. Damon. "I was out on the platform,
looking at the view, and thinking how much better my neuralgia was,
with the scarf on. Suddenly the wind whipped loose one end of the
scarf, and, before I knew it the cloth had caught on the propeller
blade. I was blown, or drawn to one side, tossed against the railing,
which I managed to grab, and then I lost my senses. It's a good thing I
wasn't whirled around the propeller."

"It's a good thing you weren't tossed down to the earth," commented
Tom, shivering as he thought of his friend's narrow escape.

"I became unconscious, partly because the wind was knocked from me as I
hit the platform railing," went on Mr. Damon, "and partly from fright,
I think. But I'm all right now, and I'm not going out on that platform
again with a loose scarf on."

"I wouldn't go out at all again, if I were you, though, of course, I'm
used to dizzy heights," spoke Mr. Sharp.

"Oh, I'm not so easily frightened," declared Mr. Damon. "If I'm going
to be a balloonist, or an aeroplanist I've got to get used to certain
things. I'm all right now," and the plucky man was, for the blow to his
side did not amount to much. It was some time, however, before Tom got
over the fright his friend had caused him.

They spent that night moving slowly south, and in the morning found
they had covered about a hundred miles, not having run the ship to
anything like its maximum speed. Breakfast was served above the clouds,
for a change, Mr. Damon finding that he could stand the great height
with comfort.

It was three days after the start, and the travelers were proceeding
slowly along. They were totally unaware, of course, of the sensation
which their leaving, conjointly with the bank robbery, had caused, not
only in Shopton but in other places.

"We're over a good-sized city," announced Tom, on the noon of the third
day. "Suppose we drop down, and leave some message? Dad will be anxious
to hear from us."

"Good idea," commented Mr. Sharp. "Down it is. Shift the rudder."

Tom proceeded to do so, and, while Mr. Damon relieved him at the wheel
the young inventor prepared a message to his father. It was placed in a
weighted envelope, together with a sum of money, and the person picking
it up was requested to send the letter as a telegram, retaining some
money for his trouble.

As the ship got lower and lower over the city the usual crowds could be
seen congregating in the streets, pointing and gazing upward.

"We're creating quite a stir," observed Tom.

"More than usual, it seems," added Mr. Sharp, peering down. "I declare,
there seems to be a police parade under way."

"That's right," put in Mr. Damon, for, looking down, a squad of
uniformed officers, some on horseback, could be seen hurrying along the
main street, trying to keep pace with the airship, which was moving
slowly.

"They're looking at us through telescopes," called Tom. "Guess they
never saw a balloon down this way."

Nearer and nearer to the city dropped the Red Cloud. Tom was about to
let go the weighted envelope, when, from the midst of the police came
several puffs of white smoke. It was followed by vicious, zipping
sounds about the cabin of the ship, the windows of which were open.
Then came the reports of several rifles.

"They're firing at us!" yelled Tom.

"So they are!" cried Mr. Sharp. "They must be crazy! Can't they see
that we're not a bird."

"Maybe they take us for a war balloon," suggested Mr. Damon.

Another volley was directed at the airship, and several bullets struck
the big aluminum gas holder glancing blows.

"Here! Quit that!" yelled Tom, leaning out of the window. "Are you
crazy? You'll damage us!"

"They can't hear you," called Mr. Sharp.

A third volley was fired, and this time several persons other than
police officers seemed to be shooting at the airship. Revolvers as well
as rifles were being used.

"We're got to get out of this!" shouted Mr. Sharp, as a bullet sang
uncomfortably close to his head. "I can't imagine what's gotten into
the people. Send her up, Tom!"

The lad quickly shifted the elevation rudder, and the Red Cloud sailed
majestically aloft. The young inventor had not dropped his message,
concluding that citizens who would fire on travelers of the air for no
reason, would not be likely to accommodate them in the matter of
sending messages.

The craft mounted rapidly upward, but before it was beyond rifle shot
another volley was fired, one bullet sending some splinters flying from
the wooden framework.

"Whew! That was a narrow escape!" exclaimed Mr. Sharp. "What in the
world can those people be up to, anyhow?"




Chapter 16

Over a Fiery Furnace


Down below, the aeronauts could see the crowd, led by the police,
scurrying to and fro. Many individuals beside the officers appeared to
be holding weapons, and, from the puffs of smoke that spurted out, it
was evident that more shots were being fired. But the bullets could do
no harm, and the Red Cloud, under the force of the rapidly revolving
propellers, was soon beyond the center of the city.

"Well, if that isn't the limit!" cried Tom. "They must have taken us
for a German war balloon, about to drop explosives on them."

"Bless my liver!" ejaculated Mr. Damon, "I believe you're right. Eh,
Mr. Sharp?"

The veteran balloonist took a careful look over the craft before
replying. Then he spoke:

"It couldn't be that," and he shook his head, as if puzzled. "They
would know no foreign airship would try any trick like that. Beside, if
by some remote possibility they did imagine it, there would be soldiers
shooting at us, instead of the police. As it was, the whole population
seemed anxious to bring us down."

"And they nearly did," added Mr. Damon. "If they had shot a few holes
in the gas bag where would we be?"

"Right in the air," answered the balloonist. "It would take several
volleys of bullets to damage our aluminum container. It is in sections
and when one, or even five compartments, for that matter, are pierced,
there is enough gas in the others to sustain us. So they could not have
damaged us much, even if they had shot a lot of holes in us. Even
without the gas container we can keep afloat by constantly moving, for
the planes will serve their purpose. Of course they could damage us,
and maybe put some of our machinery out of business, and that would be
a serious thing. But what puzzles me is why they fired at us at all."

"It couldn't be out of pure mischief; could it?" asked the young
inventor.

"Hardly. If we were in a savage country I could understand the natives
firing at some such object as this airship, but the people of that city
must have known what our craft was. They probably have read something
about it in the news papers, and to deliberately fire on us, with the
chance of disabling us, seems worse than barbarous."

"Well, we won't give 'em another opportunity," commented Mr. Damon.

"No, indeed, not this city, but who knows but what the example may
spread? We may be fired at the next town we sail over."

"Then steer clear of the towns," advised Tom.

"Impossible. We must pass over some, but I'd like to solve this
mystery."

The day passed without further incident, though they did not go low
enough down over any city to drop any messages. It was decided that it
would not be safe.

"We'll take a chance at night," suggested Tom, and that evening,
approaching a good-sized town in the dusk, several of the weighted
envelopes were dropped overboard. Doubtless persons walking along the
street, who were startled by hearing something fall with a "thud" at
their feet, were much startled to look up and see, dimly, a great,
ghostly shape moving in the air. But there was no shooting, and,
eventually, some of the messages reached Mr. Swift, in Shopton. But he
could not answer them for the airship kept on the move.

The night was spent floating in the air, with the engine stopped, and
the Red Cloud floating lazily this way and that as the gentle winds
shifted, for it was calm. The "anchorage" if such it may be called, was
above a sparsely settled part of the country, and if the lights of the
airship were seen from below, the farmers doubtless took them for some
new stars or, possibly, a comet.

"Now then for a fast, straight run!" cried Tom, after breakfast had
been served, and the big motor, with its twenty cylinders, started.
"We'll be able to make the turn to-day, and then make for home, won't
we, Mr. Sharp?"

"Well, we could do it, Tom," was the answer, "but I like this mode of
traveling so that I think I'll lengthen the voyage. Instead of turning
at Atlanta, what do you say to making for Key West, and then starting
back? That will be something of a trip. The Red Cloud is behaving much
better than I hoped she would."

"I'm willing to go further if Mr. Damon is."

"Oh, bless my shoe strings, I'm game!" exclaimed the eccentric man. "I
always did want to go to Key West, anyhow."

The craft was speeding along at a fast clip, and dinner that day was
served about three miles in the air. Then, desiring to test the gliding
abilities of the airship, it was sent down on a long slant, with the
propellers stationary, the shifting planes and rudders alone guiding it.

As the craft fairly slid down out of the sky, like a sled on a bank of
fleecy snow, Tom, who was peering ahead, with his hand on the steering
wheel, cried out "I say! It looks as if we were going to run into a
thunder storm!"

"How's that?" inquired Mr. Sharp, poking his head from the motor
compartment.

"He says there's a big storm ahead," repeated Mr. Damon, "and I guess
he's right. I see a big bank of dark clouds, and there is a roaring in
the air."

Mr. Sharp, who had been making some adjustments to the motor went
forward to take a look. The Red Cloud was swiftly gliding downward on a
slant, straight toward a dark mass of vapor, that seemed to be rolling
first one way, and then another, while as Mr. Damon had said, there was
a low rumbling proceeding from it.

"That doesn't seem to be a thunder storm," spoke the balloonist, with a
puzzled air.

They all regarded the dark mass of vapor intently for a few seconds.
Tom had brought the airship to a more level keel, and it was now
spinning along under its own momentum, like a flat piece of tin, scaled
by some lead. But it was headed for the clouds, if such they were,
though losing speed by degrees.

"I'll have to start the motor!" exclaimed Mr. Sharp. "We don't want to
run into a storm, if we can help it, though I don't ever remember
seeing a thunder disturbance like that."

"Whew! It's getting warm," suddenly announced the youth, and he let go
of the steering wheel for a moment, while he took off his coat.

"That's what it is," agreed Mr. Damon, who also divested himself of his
garments. "Bless my spark plug, but it's like a July day. No wonder
there's a thunderstorm ahead."

Then Mr. Sharp uttered a cry. "That's no storm!" he fairly shouted.
"It's a big forest fire! That's smoke we see! We must get out of this.
Turn around Tom, while I start the engine. We must rise above it!"

He fairly leaped for the motor, and Tom and Mr. Damon could hear him
turning the levers and wheels, ready to start. But before the
explosions came something happened. There was a sound as of some great,
siren whistle blowing, and then, with a howl of the on rushing air, the
Red Cloud, the propellers of which hung motionless on their shafts, was
fairly sucked forward toward the fire, as the current sucks a boat over
a water fall.

"Start the motor! Start the motor, Mr. Sharp!" cried Tom.

"I'm trying to, but something seems to be the matter."

"We're being drawn right over the fire!" yelled Mr. Damon. "It's
getting hotter every minute! Can't you do something?"

"You take the wheel," called the balloonist to Mr. Damon. "Steer
around, just as if it was an auto when we start the engine. Tom, come
here and give me a hand. The motor has jammed!"

The young inventor sprang to obey. Mr. Damon, his face showing some of
the fear he felt, grasped the steering wheel. The airship was now about
a quarter of a mile high, but instead of resting motionless in the air,
sustained by the gas in the container, she was being pulled forward,
right toward the heart of the mass of black vapor, which it could now
be seen was streaked with bright tongues of flame.

"What's making us go ahead, if the motor isn't going?" asked Tom, as he
bent over the machine, at which the aeronaut was laboring.

"Suction--draught from the fire!" explained Mr. Sharp. "Heated air
rises and leaves a vacuum. The cold air rushes in. It's carrying us
with it. We'll be right in the fire in a few minutes, if we can't get
started with this motor! I don't see what ails it."

"Can't we steer to one side, as it is?"

"No. We're right in a powerful current of air, and steering won't do
any good, until we have some motion of our own. Turn the gasolene lever
on a little more, and see if you can get a spark."

Tom did so, but no explosion resulted. The twenty cylinders of the big
engine remained mute. The airship, meanwhile, was gathering speed,
sucked onward and downward as it was by the draught from the fire. The
roaring was plainer now, and the crackling of the flames could be heard
plainly. The heat, too, grew more intense.

Frantically Tom and Mr. Sharp labored over the motor. With the
perverseness usual to gas engines, it had refused to work at a critical
moment.

"What shall I do?" cried Mr. Damon from his position in the pilot
house. "We seem to be heading right for the midst of it?"

"Slant the elevation rudder," called Tom. "Send the ship up. It will be
cooler the higher we go. Maybe we can float over it!"

"You'd better go out there," advised Mr. Sharp. "I'll keep at this
motor. Go up as high as you can. Turn on more gas. That will elevate
us, but maybe not quick enough. The gas doesn't generate well in great
heat. I'm afraid we're in for it," he added grimly.

Tom sprang to relieve Mr. Damon. The heat was now intense. Nearer and
nearer came the Red Cloud to the blazing forest, which seemed to cover
several square miles. Great masses of smoke, with huge pieces of
charred and blazing wood carried up by the great draught, circled
around the ship. The Red Cloud was being pulled into the midst of the
fire by the strong suction. Tom yanked over the elevation rudder, and
the nose of the craft pointed upward. But it still moved downward, and,
a moment later the travelers of the air felt as if they were over a
fiery furnace.




Chapter 17

"Wanted For Robbery!"


Choking and gasping for breath, feeling as if they could not stand the
intense heat more than a moment longer, the young inventor and his
companions looked at each other. Death seemed ready to reach out and
grasp them. The mass of heated air was so powerful that it swung and
tossed the Red Cloud about as if it were a wisp of paper.

"We must do something!" cried Mr. Damon, beginning to take off his
collar and vest. "I'm choking!"

"Lie down in the bottom of the car," suggested Mr. Sharp. "The smoke
won't trouble you so much there."

The eccentric man, too startled, now, to use any of his "blessing"
expressions, did so.

"Can't you start the motor?" asked Tom frantically, as he stuck to his
post, with his hand on the steering wheel, the elevation lever jammed
back as far as it would go.

"I've done my best," answered the balloonist, gasping as he swallowed
some smoke. "I'm afraid--afraid it's all up with us. We should have
steered clear of this from the first. My, how it roars!"

The crackling and snapping of the flames below them, as they fed on the
dry wood, which no rain had wet for weeks, was like the rush of some
great cataract. Up swirled the dark smoke-clouds, growing hotter and
hotter all the while as the craft came nearer and nearer to the center
of the conflagration.

"We must rise higher!" cried Tom. "It's our only chance. Turn on the
gas machine full power, and fill the container. That will carry us up!"

"Yes, it's our only hope," muttered Mr. Sharp. "We must go up, but the
trouble is the gas doesn't generate so fast when there's too much heat.
We're bound to have to stay over this fiery pit for some time yet."

"We're going up a little!" spoke Tom hopefully, as he glanced at a
gauge near him. "We're fifteen hundred feet now, and we were only
twelve a while ago."

"Good! Keep the elevation rudder as it is, and I'll see what I can do
with the gas," advised the balloonist. "It's our only hope," and he
hurried into the engine room, which, like the other parts of the cabin,
was now murky with choking vapor and soot.

Suddenly the elevation gauge showed that they were falling. The airship
was going down.

"What's the matter?" called Mr. Damon, from the cabin floor.

"I don't know," answered Tom, "unless the rudder has broken."

He peered through the haze. No, the big elevation rudder was still in
place, but it seemed to have no effect on the shim.

"It's a down draught!" cried Mr. Sharp. "We're being sucked down. It
won't last but a few seconds. I've been in 'em before."

He seemed to have guessed rightly, for, the next instant the airship
was shooting upward again, and relief came to the aeronauts, though it
was not much, for the heat was almost unbearable, and they had taken
off nearly all their clothing.

"Lighten ship!" sung out Mr. Sharp. "Toss over all the things you think
we can spare, Tom. Some of the cases of provisions--we can get more--if
we need 'em. We must rise, and the gas isn't generating fast enough!"

There was no need for the young inventor at the steering wheel now, for
the craft simply could not be guided. It was swirled about, now this
way, now that, by the currents of heated air. At times it would rise a
considerable distance, only to be pulled down again, and, just before
Tom began to toss overboard some boxes of food, it seemed that the end
had come, for the craft went down so low that the upward leaping
tongues of flame almost reached the lower frame.

"I'll help you," gasped Mr. Damon, and while he and Tom tossed from the
cabin windows some of their stores, Mr. Sharp was frantically
endeavoring to make the gas generate faster.

It was slow work, but with the lightening of the ship their situation
improved. Slowly, so slowly that it seemed an age, the elevation
pointer went higher and higher on the dial.

"Sixteen hundred feet!" sung out Tom, pausing for a look at the gauge.
"That's the best yet!"

The heat was felt less, now, and every minute was improving their
situation. Slowly the hand moved. The gas was being made in larger
quantities now that the heat was less. Ten minutes more of agony, and
their danger was over. They were still above the burning area, but
sufficiently high so that only stray wisps of smoke enveloped them.

"Whew! But that was the worst ever!" cried Tom, as he sank exhausted on
a bench, and wiped his perspiring face. "We sure were in a bad way!"

"I should say so," agreed Mr. Sharp. "And if we don't get a breeze we
may have to stay here for some time."

"Why, can't you get that motor to work yet?" asked Mr. Damon. "Bless my
gaiters, but I'm all in, as the boys say."

"I'll have another try at the machine now," replied Mr. Sharp.
"Probably it will work now, after we're out of danger without the aid
of it."

His guess proved correct, for, in a few minutes, with the aid of Tom,
the motor started, the propellers revolved, and the Red Cloud was sent
swiftly out of the fire zone.

"Now we'd better take account of ourselves, our provisions, and the
ship," said Mr. Sharp, when they had flown about twenty miles, and were
much refreshed by the cooler atmosphere. "I don't believe the craft is
damaged any, except some of the braces may be warped by the heat. As
for the provisions, you threw over a lot; didn't you, Tom?"

"Well, I had to."

"Yes, I guess you did. Well, we'll make a landing."

"Do you think it will be safe?" asked Mr. Damon anxiously. "We might be
fired upon again."

"Oh, there's no danger of that. But I'll take precautions. I don't want
a big crowd around when we come down, so we'll pick out a secluded
place and land just at dusk. Then in the morning we can look over the
ship, and go to the nearest town to buy provisions. After that we can
continue our journey, and we'll steer clear of forest fires after this."

"And people who shoot at us," added Mr. Damon.

"Yes. I wish I knew what that was done for," and once again came that
puzzled look to the face of the balloonist.

The airship gently descended that evening in a large level field, a
good landing being made. Just before the descent Tom took an
observation and located, about two miles from the spot they selected
for an "anchorage," a good-sized village.

"We can get provisions there," he announced.

"Yes, but we must not let it be known what they are for," said Mr.
Sharp, "or we'll have the whole population out here. I think this will
be a good plan: Tom, you and Mr. Damon go into town and buy the things
we need. I'll stay here with the airship, and look it all over. You can
arrange to have the stuff carted out here in the morning, and left at a
point say about a quarter of a mile away. Then we can carry it to the
ship. In that way no one will discover us, and we'll not be bothered
with curiosity-seekers."

This was voted a good idea, and, when the landing had been made, and a
hasty examination showed that the ship had suffered no great damage
from the passage over the fire, the young inventor and Mr. Damon
started off.

They soon found a good road, leading to town, and tramped along it in
the early evening. The few persons they met paid little attention to
them, save to bow in a friendly fashion, and, occasionally wish them
good evening.

"I wonder where we are?" asked Tom, as they hurried along.

"In some southern town, to judge by the voices of the people, and the
number of colored individuals we've met," answered Mr. Damon.

"Let's ask," suggested Tom.

"No, if you do they'll know we're strangers, and they may ask a lot of
questions."

"Oh, I guess if it's a small place they'll know we're strangers soon
enough," commented Tom. "But when we get to the village itself we can
read the name on the store windows."

A few minutes later found them in the midst of a typical southern town.
It was Berneau, North Carolina, according to the signs, they saw.

"Here's a restaurant," called Tom, as they passed a neat-appearing one.
"Let's go inside and get some supper before we buy our supplies."

"Good!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Bless my flapjacks, but I am beginning to
feel hungry."

The eating place was a good one, and Tom's predictions about their
being taken for strangers was verified, for, no sooner had they given
their orders than the pretty, white girl, who waited on the table
remarked:

"Ah reckon yo' all are from th' no'th; aren't yo'?" She smiled, as she
spoke, and Tom smiled back as he acknowledged it.

"Have you a paper--a newspaper I could look at?" he asked.

"Ah guess Ah can find one," went on the girl. "Ah reckon yo' all are
from N' York. N' Yorkers are so desperant bent on readin' th' news."
Her tones were almost like those of a colored person.

"Yes, we're from a part of New York," was Tom's reply.

When a newspaper was brought to him, after they had nearly finished
their meal, the young inventor rapidly scanned the pages. Something on
the front sheet, under a heading of big, black type caught his eye. He
started as he read it.


  WANTED FOR ROBBERY!
  BANK LOOTERS ESCAPE IN RED AIRSHIP--FIRED AT
  BUT DISAPPEAR


"Great Jehosophat!" exclaimed Tom, in a low voice. "What on earth can
this mean?"

"What?" inquired Mr. Damon. "Has anything happened?"

"Happened? I should say there had," was the answer. "Why, we're accused
of having robbed the Shopton Bank of seventy-five thousand dollars the
night before we left, and to have taken it away in the Red Cloud.
There's a general alarm out for us! Why this is awful!"

"It's preposterous!" burst out Mr. Damon. "I'll have my lawyers sue
this paper. Bless my stocks and bonds, I!"

"Hush! Not so loud," cautioned Tom, for the pretty waitress was
watching them curiously. "Here, read this, and then we'll decide what
to do. But one thing is certain, we must go back to Shopton at once to
clear ourselves of this accusation."

"Ha!" murmured Mr. Damon, as he read the article rapidly. "Now I know
why they fired at us. They hoped to bring us down, capture us, and get
the five thousand dollars reward!"




Chapter 18

Back For Vindication


Tom glanced around the restaurant. There were few persons in it save
himself and Mr. Damon. The pretty waitress was still regarding the two
curiously.

"We ought to take that paper along with us, to show to Mr. Sharp," said
Tom, in a low voice to his friend. "I haven't had time to take it all
in myself, yet. Let's go. I've had enough to eat, haven't you?"

"Yes. My appetite is gone now."

As they arose, to pay their checks the girl advanced.

"Can you tell me where I can get a copy of this paper?" asked Tom, as
he laid down a generous tip on the table, for the girl. Her eyes opened
rather wide.

"Yo' all are fo'gettin' some of yo' money," she said, in her broad,
southern tones. Tom thought her the prettiest girl he ever seen,
excepting Mary Nestor.

"Oh, that's for you," replied the young inventor. "It's a tip. Aren't
you in the habit of getting them down here?"

"Not very often. Thank yo' all. But what did yo' all ask about that
paper?"

"I asked where I could get a copy of it. There is something in it that
interests me."

"Yes, an' Ah reckon Ah knows what it is," exclaimed the girl. "It's
about that airship with th' robbers in it!"

"How do you know?" inquired Tom quickly, and he tried to seem cool,
though he felt the hot blood mounting to his cheeks.

"Oh, Ah saw yo' all readin' it. Everybody down heah is crazy about it.
We all think th' ship is comin' down this way, 'cause it says th'
robbers was intendin' to start south befo' they robbed th' bank. Ah
wish Ah could collect thet five thousand dollars. If Ah could see that
airship, I wouldn't work no mo' in this eatin' place. What do yo' all
reckon thet airship looks like?" and the girl gazed intently at Tom and
Mr. Damon.

"Why, bless my--" began the eccentric man, but Tom broke in hurriedly:

"Oh, I guess it looks like most any other airship," for he feared that
if his companion used any of his odd expressions he might be
recognized, since our hero had not had time to read the article in the
paper through, and was not sure whether or not a description of
himself, Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp was given.

"Well, Ah suah wish I could collect thet reward," went on the girl.
"Everybody is on th' lookout. Yo' all ain't see th' airship; have yo'
all?"

"Where can we get a paper like this?" asked Tom, again, not wanting to
answer such a leading question.

"Why, yo' all is suah welcome to that one," was the reply. "Ah guess Ah
can affo'd to give it to yo' all, after th' generous way yo' all
behaved to me. Take it, an' welcome. But are yo' all suah yo' are done
eatin'? Yo' all left lots."

"Oh, we had enough," replied Tom hurriedly. His sole aim now was to get
away--to consult with Mr. Sharp, and he needed the paper to learn
further details of the astonishing news. He and his friends accused of
looting the bank, and taking away seventy-five thousand dollars in the
airship! It was incredible! A reward of five thousand dollars offered
for their capture! They might be arrested any minute, yet they could
not go on without buying some provisions. What were they to do?

Once outside the restaurant, Mr. Damon and Tom walked swiftly on. They
came to a corner where there was a street lamp, and there the young
inventor paused to scan the paper again. It was the copy of a journal
published in the nearby county seat, and contained quite a full account
of the affair.

The story was told of how the bank had been broken into, the vault
rifled and the money taken. The first clue, it said, was given by a
youth named Andy Foger, who had seen a former acquaintance hanging
around the bank with burglar tools. Tom recognized the description of
himself as the "former acquaintance," but he could not understand the
rest.

"Burglar tools? I wonder how Andy could say that?" he asked Mr. Damon.

"Wait until we get back, and we'll ask John Sharp," suggested his
companion. "This is very strange. I am going to sue some one for
spreading false reports about me! Bless my ledgers, why I have money on
deposit in that bank! To think that I would rob it!"

"Poor dad!" murmured Tom. "This must be hard for him. But what about
ordering food? Maybe if we buy any they will trail us, find the airship
and capture it. I don't want to be arrested, even if I am innocent, and
I certainly don't want the airship to fall into the hands of the
police. They might damage it."

"We must go see Mr. Sharp," declared Mr. Damon, and back to where the
Red Cloud was concealed they went.

To say that the balloonist was astonished is putting it mildly. He was
even more excited than was Mr. Damon.

"Wait until I get hold of that Andy Foger!" he cried. "I'll make him
sweat for this! I see he's already laid claim to the reward," he added,
reading further along in the article. "He thinks he has put the police
on our trail."

"So he seems to have done," added Tom. "The whole country has been
notified to look out for us," the paper says. "We're likely to be fired
upon whenever we pass over a city or a town."

"Then we'll have to avoid them," declared the balloonist.

"But we must go back," declared Tom.

"Of course. Back to be vindicated. We'll have to give up our trip. My,
my! But this is a surprise!"

"I don't see what makes Andy say he saw me with burglar tools,"
commented Tom, with a puzzled air.

Mr. Sharp thought for a moment. Then he exclaimed "It was that bag of
tools I sent you after--the long wrenches, the pliers, and the brace
and bits.  You--"

"Of course!" cried Tom. "I remember now. The bag dropped and opened,
and Andy and Sam saw the tools. But the idea of taking them for burglar
tools!"

"Well, I suppose the burglars, whoever they were, did use tools similar
to those to break open the vault," put in Mr. Damon. "Andy probably
thought he was a smart lad to put the police on our track."

"I'll put him on the track, when I return," declared Mr. Sharp. "Well,
now, what's to be done?"

"We've got to have food," suggested Tom.

"Yes, but I think we can manage that. I've been looking over the ship,
as best I could in the dark. It seems to be all right. We can start
early in the morning without anyone around here knowing we paid their
town a visit. You and Mr. Damon go back to town, Tom, and order some
stuff. Have the man leave it by the roadside early to-morrow morning.
Tell him it's for some travelers, who will stop and pick it up. Pay him
well, and tell him to keep quiet, as it's for a racing party.  That's
true enough. We're going to race home to vindicate our reputations. I
think that will be all right."

"The man may get suspicious," said Mr. Damon.

"I hope not," answered the balloonist. "We've got to take a chance,
anyhow."

The plan worked well, however, the store keeper promising to have the
supplies on hand at the time and place mentioned. He winked as Tom
asked him to keep quiet about it.

"Oh, I know yo' automobile fellers," he said with a laugh. "You want to
get some grub on the fly, so you won't have to stop, an' can beat th'
other fellow. I know you, fer I see them automobile goggles stickin'
out of your pocket."

Tom and Mr. Damon each had a pair, to use when the wind was strong, but
the young inventor had forgotten about his. They now served him a good
turn, for they turned the thoughts of the storekeeper into a new
channel. The lad let it go at that, and, paying for such things as he
and Mr. Damon could not carry, left the store.

The aeronauts passed an uneasy night. They raised their ship high in
the air, anchoring it by a rope fast to a big tree, and they turned on
no lights, for they did not want to betray their position. They
descended before it was yet daylight, and a little later hurried to the
place where the provisions were left. They found their supplies safely
on hand, and, carrying them into the airship, prepared to turn back to
Shopton.

As the ship rose high in the air a crowd of negro laborers passing
through a distant field, saw it. At once they raised a commotion,
shouting and pointing to the wonderful sight.

"We're discovered!" cried Tom.

"No matter," answered Mr. Sharp. "We'll soon be out of sight, and we'll
fly high the rest of this trip."

Tom looked down on the fast disappearing little hamlet, and he thought
of the pretty girl in the restaurant.




Chapter 19

Wrecked


With her nose headed north, the Red Cloud swung along through the air.
Those on board were thinking of many things, but chief among them was
the unjust accusation that had been made against them, by an
irresponsible boy--the red-haired Andy Foger. They read the account in
the paper again, seeking to learn from it new things at each perusal.

"It's just a lot of circumstantial evidence that's what it is," said
Tom. "I admit it might look suspicious to anyone who didn't know us,
but Andy Foger has certainly done the most mischief by his conclusions.
Burglar tools! The idea!"

"I think I shall sue the bank for damages," declared Mr. Damon. "They
have injured my reputation by making this accusation against me.
Anyhow, I'll certainly never do any more business with them, and I'll
withdraw my ten thousand dollars deposit, as soon as we get back."

"Mr. Sharp doesn't seem to be accused of doing anything at all,"
remarked Tom, reading the article for perhaps the tenth time.

"Oh, I guess I'm a sort of general all-around bad man, who helped you
burglars to escape with the booty," answered the balloonist, with a
laugh. "I expect to be arrested along with you two."

"But must we be arrested?" inquired Tom anxiously. "I don't like that
idea at all. We haven't done anything."

"This is my plan," went on Mr. Sharp. "We'll get back to Shopton as
quickly as we can. We'll arrive at night, so no one will see us, and,
leaving the airship in some secluded spot, we'll go to the police and
explain matters. We can easily prove that we had nothing to do with the
robbery. Why we were all home the night it happened! Mr. Swift, Mr.
Jackson and Mrs. Baggert can testify to that."

"Yes," agreed Mr. Damon. "I guess they can. Bless my bank book, but
that seems a good plan. We'll follow it."

Proceeding on the plan which they had decided was the best one, the Red
Cloud was sent high into the air. So high up was it that, at times it
was above the clouds. Though this caused some little discomfort at
first, especially to Mr. Damon, he soon became used to it, as did the
others. And it had the advantage of concealing them from the persons
below who might be on the lookout.

"For we don't want to be shot at again," explained Mr. Sharp. "It isn't
altogether healthy, and not very safe. If we keep high up they can't
see us; much less shoot at us. They'll take us for some big bird. Then,
too, we can go faster."

"I suppose there will be another alarm sent out, from those negroes
having sighted us," ventured Tom.

"Oh, yes, but those colored fellows were so excited they may describe
us as having horns, hoofs and a tail, and their story may not be
believed. I'm not worrying about them. My chief concern is to drive the
Red Cloud for all she is worth. I want to explain some things back
there in Shopton."

As if repenting of the way it had misbehaved over the forest fire, the
airship was now swinging along at a rapid rate. Seated in the cabin the
travelers would have really enjoyed the return trip had it not been for
the accusation hanging over them. The weather was fine and clear, and
as they skimmed along, now and then coming out from the clouds, they
caught glimpses below them of the earth above which they were
traveling. They had a general idea of their location, from knowing the
town where the paper had given them such astounding news, and it was
easy to calculate their rate of progress.

After running about a hundred miles or so, at high speed Mr. Sharp
found it necessary to slow down the motor, as some of the new bearings
were heating. Still this gave them no alarm, as they were making good
time. They came to a stop that night, and calculated that by the next
evening, or two at the latest, they would be back in Shopton. But they
did not calculate on an accident.

One of the cylinders on the big motor cracked, as they started up next
morning, and for some hours they had to hang in the air, suspended by
the gas in the container, while Mr. Sharp and Tom took out the damaged
part, and put in a spare one, the cylinders being cast separately. It
was dusk when they finished, and too late to start up, so they remained
about in the same place until the next day.

Morning dawned with a hot humidness, unusual at that time of the year,
but partly accounted for by the fact that they were still within the
influence of the southern climate. With a whizz the big propellers were
set in motion, and, with Tom at the wheel, the ship being about three
miles in the air, to which height it had risen after the repairs were
made, the journey was recommenced.

"It's cooler up here than down below," remarked Tom, as he shifted the
wheel and rudder a bit, in response to a gust of wind, that heeled the
craft over.

"Yes, I think we're going to have a storm," remarked Mr. Sharp, eyeing
the clouds with a professional air. "We may run ahead of it, or right
into it. We'll go down a bit, toward night, when there's less danger of
being shot."

So far, on their return trip, they had not been low enough, in the day
time, to be in any danger from persons who hoped to earn the five
thousand dollars reward.

The afternoon passed quickly, and it got dark early. There was a
curious hum to the wind, and, hearing it, Mr. Sharp began to go about
the ship, seeing that everything was fast and taut.

"We're going to have a blow," he remarked, "and a heavy one, too.
We'll have to make everything snug, and be ready to go up or down, as
the case calls for."

"Up or down?" inquired Mr. Damon.

"Yes. By rising we may escape the blow, or, by going below the strata
of agitated air, we may escape it."

"How about rain?"

"Well, you can get above rain, but you can't get below it, with the law
of gravitation working as it does at present. How's the gas generator,
Tom?"

"Seems to be all right," replied the young inventor, who had
relinquished the wheel to the balloonist.

They ate an early supper, and, hardly had the dishes been put away,
when from the west, where there was a low-flying bank of clouds, there
came a mutter of thunder. A little later there was a dull, red
illumination amid the rolling masses of vapor.

"There's the storm, and she's heading right this way," commented Mr.
Sharp.

"Can't you avoid it?" asked Mr. Damon, anxiously.

"I could, if I knew how high it was, but I guess we'll wait and see how
it looks as we get closer."

The airship was flying on, and the storm, driven by a mighty wind, was
rushing to meet it. Already there was a sighing, moaning sound in the
wire and wooden braces of the Red Cloud.

Suddenly there came such a blast that it heeled the ship over on her
side.

"Shift the equilibrium rudders!" shouted Mr. Sharp to Tom, turning the
wheel and various levers over to the lad. "I'm going to get more speed
out of the motor!"

Tom acted just in time, and, after bobbing about like a cork on the
water, the ship was righted, and sent forging ahead, under the
influence of the propellers worked at top speed. Nor was this any too
much, for it needed all the power of the big engine to even partially
overcome the force of the wind that was blowing right against the Red
Cloud. Of course they might have turned and flown before it, but they
wanted to go north, not south--they wanted to face their accusers.

Then, after the first fury of the blast had spent itself, there came a
deluge of rain, following a dazzling glare of lightning and a bursting
crash of thunder.

In spite of the gale buffeting her, the airship was making good
progress. The skill of Tom and the balloonist was never shown to better
advantage. All around them the storm raged, but through it the craft
kept on her way. Nothing could be seen but pelting sheets of water and
swirling mist, yet onward the ship was driven.

The thunder was deafening, and the lightning nearly blinded them, until
the electrics were switched on, flooding the cabin with radiance.
Inside the car they were snug and dry, though the pitching of the craft
was like that of a big liner in the trough of the ocean waves.

"Will she weather it, do you think?" called Mr. Damon, in the ear of
Mr. Sharp, shouting so as to be heard above the noise of the elements,
and the hum of the motor.

The balloonist nodded.

"She's a good ship," he answered proudly.

Hardly had he spoken when there came a crash louder than any that had
preceded, and the flash of rosy light that accompanied it seemed to set
the whole heavens on fire. At the same time there was violent shock to
the ship.

"We're hit! Struck by lightning!" yelled Tom.

"We're falling!" cried Mr. Damon an instant later.

Mr. Sharp looked at the elevation gauge. The hand was slowly swinging
around. Down, down dropped the Red Cloud. She was being roughly treated
by the storm.

"I'm afraid we're wrecked!" said the balloonist in a low voice,
scarcely audible above the roar of the tempest. Following the great
crash had come a comparatively light bombardment from the sky artillery.

"Use the gliding rudder, Tom," called Mr. Sharp, a moment later. "We
may fall, but we'll land as easily as possible."

The wind, the rain, the lightning and thunder continued. Down, down
sank the ship. Its fall was somewhat checked by the rudder Tom swung
into place, and by setting the planes at a different angle. The motor
had been stopped, and the propellers no longer revolved. In the
confusion and darkness it was not safe to run ahead, with the danger of
colliding with unseen objects on the earth.

They tried to peer from the windows, but could see nothing. A moment
later, as they stared at each other with fear in their eyes, there came
a shock. The ship trembled from end to end.

"We've landed!" cried Tom, as he yanked back on the levers. The airship
came to a stop.

"Now to see where we are," said Mr. Sharp grimly, "and how badly we are
wrecked."




Chapter 20

Tom Gets A Clue


Out of the cabin of the now stationary airship hurried the three
travelers; out into the pelting rain, which was lashed into their faces
by the strong wind. Tom was the first to emerge.

"We're on something solid!" he cried, stamping his feet. "A rock, I
guess."

"Gracious, I hope we're not on a rock in the midst of a river!"
exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Bless my soul, though! The water does seem to be
running around my ankles."

"There's enough rain to make water run almost up to our necks," called
Mr. Sharp, above the noise of the storm. "Tom, can you make out where
we are?"

"Not exactly. Is the ship all right?"

"I can't see very well, but there appears to be a hole in the gas
container. A big one, too, or we wouldn't have fallen so quickly."

The plight of the travelers of the air was anything but enviable. They
were wet through, for it needed only a few minutes exposure to the
pelting storm to bring this about. They could not tell, in the midst of
the darkness, where they were, and they almost feared to move for fear
they might be on top of some rock or precipice, over which they might
tumble if they took a false step.

"Let's get back inside the ship," proposed Mr. Damon. "It's warm and
dry there, at all events. Bless my umbrella, I don't know when I've
been so wet!"

"I'm not going in until I find out where we are," declared Tom. "Wait a
minute, and I'll go in and get an electric flash lantern. That will
show us," for the lightning had ceased with the great crash that seemed
to have wrecked the Red Cloud. The rain still kept up, however, and
there was a distant muttering of thunder, while it was so black that
had not the lights in the cabin of the airship been faintly glowing
they could hardly have found the craft had they moved ten feet away
from it.

Tom soon returned with the portable electric lamp, operated by dry
batteries. He flashed it on the surface of where they were standing,
and uttered an exclamation.

"We're on a roof!" he cried.

"A roof?" repeated Mr. Damon.

"Yes; the roof of some large building, and what you thought was a river
is the rain water running off it. See!"

The young inventor held the light down so his companions could observe
the surface of that upon which the airship rested. There was no doubt
of it. They were on top of a large building.

"If we're on a roof we must be in the midst of a city," objected Mr.
Damon. "But I can't see any lights around, and we would see them if we
were in a city, you know."

"Maybe the storm put the lights out of business," suggested Mr. Sharp.
"That often occurs."

"I know one way we can find out for certain," went on Tom.

"How?"

"Start up our search lamp, and play it all around. We can't make sure
how large this roof is in the dark, and it's risky trying to trace the
edges by walking around."

"Yes, and it would be risky to start our searchlight going," objected
Mr. Sharp. "People would see it, and there'd be a crowd up here in less
than no time, storm or no storm. No, we've got to keep dark until I can
see what's the matter. We must leave here before daylight."

"Suppose we can't?" asked Mr. Damon. "The crowds will be sure to see us
then, anyhow."

"I am pretty sure we can get away," was the opinion of the balloonist.
"Even if our gas container is so damaged that it will not sustain us,
we are still an aeroplane, and this roof being flat will make a good
place to start from. No, we can leave as soon as this storm lets up a
little."

"Then I'm going to have a look and find out what sort of a building
this is," declared Tom, and, while Mr. Sharp began a survey, as well as
he could in the dark, of the airship, the young inventor proceeded
cautiously to ascertain the extent of the roof.

The rain was not coming down quite so hard now, and Tom found it easier
to see. Mr. Damon, finding he could do nothing to help, went back into
the cabin, blessing himself and his various possessions at the queer
predicament in which they found themselves.

Flashing his light every few seconds, Tom walked on until he came to
one edge of the roof. It was very large, as he could judge by the time
it took him to traverse it. There was a low parapet at the edge. He
peered over, and an expanse of dark wall met his eyes.

"Must have come to one side," he reasoned. "I want to get to the front.
Then, maybe, I can see a sign that will tell me what I want to know."

The lad turned to the left, and, presently came to another parapet. It
was higher, and ornamented with terra-cotta bricks. This, evidently,
was the front. As Tom peered over the edge of the little raised ledge,
there flashed out below him hundreds of electric lights. The city
illuminating plant was being repaired. Then Tom saw flashing below him
one of those large signs made of incandescent lights. It was in front
of the building, and as soon as our hero saw the words he knew where
the airship had landed. For what he read, as he leaned over, was this:



MIDDLEVILLE ARCADE



Tom gave a cry.

"What's the matter?" called Mr. Sharp.

"I've discovered something," answered Tom, hurrying up to his friend.
"We're on top of the Middleville Arcade building."

"What does that mean?"

"It means that we're not so very far from home, and in the midst of a
fairly large city. But it means more than that."

"What?" demanded the balloonist, struck by an air of excitement about
the lad, for, as Tom stood in the subdued glow of the lights from one
of the airship's cabin windows, all the others having been darkened as
the storm slackened, his, eyes shone brightly.

"This is the building where Anson Morse, one of the gang that robbed
dad, once had an office," went on Tom eagerly. "That was brought out at
the trial. And it's the place where they used to do some of their
conspiring. Maybe some of the crowd are here now laying low."

"Well, if they are, we don't want anything to do with that gang," said
Mr. Sharp. "We can't arrest them. Besides I've found out that our ship
is all right, after all. We can proceed as soon as we like. There is
only a small leak in the gas container. It was the generator machine
that was put out of business by the lightning, and I've repaired it."

"I want to see if I can get any trace of the rascals. Maybe I could
learn something from the janitor of the Arcade about them. The janitor
is probably here."

"But why do you want to get any information about that gang?"

"Because," answered Tom, and, as Mr. Damon at that moment started to
come from the cabin of the airship, the lad leaped forward and
whispered the remainder of the sentence into the ear of the balloonist.

"You don't mean it!" exclaimed Mr. Sharp, in a tense whisper. Tom
nodded vigorously.

"But how can you enter the building?" asked the other. "You can't drop
over the edge."

"Down the scuttle," answered Tom. "There must be one on the roof, for
they have to come up here at times. We can force the lock, if
necessary. I want to enter the building and see where Morse had his
office."

"All right. Go ahead. I'll engage Mr. Damon here so he won't follow
you. It will be great news for him. Go ahead."

Under pretense of wanting the help of the eccentric man in completing
the repairs he had started, Mr. Sharp took Mr. Damon back into the
cabin. Tom, getting a big screwdriver from an outside toolbox,
approached the scuttle on the roof. He could see it looming up in the
semidarkness, a sort of box, covering a stairway that led down into the
building. The door was locked, but Tom forced it, and felt justified. A
few minutes later, cautiously flashing his light, almost like a burglar
he thought, he was prowling around the corridors of the office
structure.

Was it deserted? That was what he wanted to know. He knew the office
Morse had formerly occupied was two floors from the top. Tom descended
the staircase, trying to think up some excuse to offer, in case he met
the watchman or janitor. But he encountered no one. As he reached the
floor where he knew Morse and his gang were wont to assemble, he paused
and listened. At first he heard nothing, then, as the sound of the
storm became less he fancied he heard the murmur of voices.

"Suppose it should be some of them?" whispered Tom.

He went forward, pausing at almost every other step to listen. The
voices became louder. Tom was now nearly at the office, where Morse had
once had his quarters. Now he could see it, and his heart gave a great
thump as he noticed that the place was lighted. The lad could read the
name on the door. "Industrial Development Company." That was the name
of a fake concern headed by Morse. As our hero looked he saw the
shadows of two men thrown on the ground glass.

"Some one's in there!" he whispered to himself. He could now hear the
voices much plainer. They came from the room, but the lad could not
distinguish them as belonging to any of the gang with whom he had come
in contact, and who had escaped from jail.

The low murmur went on for several seconds.

The listener could make out no words. Suddenly the low, even mumble was
broken. Some one cried out "There's got to be a divvy soon.  There's no
use letting Morse hold that whole seventy-five thousand any longer. I'm
going to get what's coming to me, or--"

"Hush!" some one else cried. "Be quiet!"

"No, I won't! I want my share. I've waited long enough. If I don't get
what's coming to me inside of a week, I'll go to Shagmon myself and
make Morse whack up. I helped on the job, and I want my money!"

"Will you be quiet?" pleaded another, and, at that instant Tom heard
some one's hand on the knob. The door opened a crack, letting out a
pencil of light. The men were evidently coming out. The young inventor
did not wait to hear more. He had a clue now, and, running on tiptoes,
he made his way to the staircase and out of the scuttle on the roof.




Chapter 21

On The Trail


"What's the matter, Tom?" asked Mr. Sharp, as the lad came hurrying
along the roof, having taken the precaution to fasten the scuttle door
as well as he could. "You seem excited." "So would you, if you had
heard what I did."

"What? You don't mean that some of the gang is down there?"

"Yes, and what's more I'm on the trail of the thieves who robbed the
Shopton Bank of the seventy-five thousand dollars!"

"No! You don't mean it!"

"I certainly do."

"Then we'd better tell Mr. Damon. He's in the cabin."

"Of course I'll tell him. He's as much concerned as I am. He wants to
be vindicated. Isn't it great luck, though?"

"But you haven't landed the men yet. Do you mean to say that the same
gang--the Happy Harry crowd--robbed the bank?"

"I think so, from what I heard. But come inside and I'll tell you all
about it."

"Suppose we start the ship first? It's ready to run. There wasn't as
much the matter with it as I feared. The storm is over now, and we'll
be safer up in the air than on this roof. Did you get all the
information you could?"

"All I dared to. The men were coming out, so I had to run. They were
quarreling, and when that happens among thieves--"

"Why honest men get their dues, everyone knows that proverb,"
interrupted Mr. Damon, again emerging from the cabin. "But bless my
quotation marks, I should think you'd have something better to do than
stand there talking proverbs."

"We have," replied Mr. Sharp quickly. "We're going to start the ship,
and then we have some news for you. Tom, you take the steering wheel,
and I'll start the gas machine. We'll rise to some distance before
starting the propellers, and then we won't create any excitement."

"But what news are you going to tell me?" asked Mr. Damon. "Bless my
very existence, but you get me all excited, and then you won't gratify
my curiosity."

"In a little while we will," responded Mr. Sharp. "Lively now, Tom.
Some one may see this airship on top of the building, as it's getting
so much lighter now, after the storm."

The outburst of the elements was almost over and Tom taking another
look over the edge of the roof, could see persons moving about in the
street below. The storm clouds were passing and a faint haze showed
where a moon would soon make its appearance, thus disclosing the craft
so oddly perched upon the roof. There was need of haste.

Fortunately the Red Cloud could be sent aloft without the use of the
propellers, for the gas would serve to lift her. It had been found that
lightning had struck the big, red aluminum container, but the shock had
been a comparatively slight one, and, as the tank was insulated from
the rest of the ship no danger resulted to the occupants. A rent was
made in two or three of the gas compartments, but the others remained
intact, and, when an increased pressure of the vapor was used the ship
was almost as buoyant as before.

Into the cabin the three travelers hurried, dripping water at every
step, for there was no time to change clothes. Then, with Tom and Mr.
Sharp managing the machinery, the craft slowly rose. It was well that
they had started for, when a few hundred feet above the roof, the moon
suddenly shone from behind a bank of clouds and would most certainly
have revealed their position to persons in the street. As it was
several were attracted by the sight of some great object in the air.
They called the attention of others to it, but, by the time glasses and
telescopes had been brought to bear, the Red Cloud was far away.

"Dry clothes now, some hot drinks, and then Tom will tell us his
secret," remarked Mr. Sharp, and, with the great ship swaying high
above the city of Middleville Tom told what he had heard in the office
building.

"They are the thieves who looted the bank, and caused us to be unjustly
accused," he finished. "If we can capture them we'll get the reward,
and turn a neat trick on Andy Foger and his cronies."

"But how can you capture them?" asked Mr. Damon. "You don't know where
they are."

"Perhaps not where Morse and the men who have the money are. But I have
a plan. It's this: We'll go to some quiet place, leave the airship, and
then inform the authorities of our suspicions. They can come here and
arrest the men who still seem to be hanging out in Morse's office. Then
we can get on the trail of this Shagmon, who seems to be the person in
authority this time, though I never heard of him before."

"He seems to have the money, according to what one of the men in the
office said, and he's the man we want."

"Shagmon!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Yes, Shagmon. The fellow I heard
talking 'said he'd go to Shagmon and make Morse whack up. Shagmon may
be the real head of the gang."

"Ha! I have it!" cried Mr. Damon suddenly. "I wonder I didn't think of
it before. Shagmon is the headquarters, not the head of the gang!"

"What do you mean?" asked Tom, much excited.

"I mean that there's a town called Shagmon about fifty miles from here.
That's what the fellow in the office meant. He is going to the town of
Shagmon and make Morse whack up. That's where Morse is! That's where
the gang is hiding! That's where the money is! Hurrah, Tom, we're on
the trail!"




Chapter 22

The Sheriff On Board


The announcement of Mr. Damon came as a great surprise to Tom and Mr.
Sharp. They had supposed that the reference to Shagmon was to a person,
and never dreamed that it was to a locality. But Mr. Damon's knowledge
of geography stood them in good stead.

"Well, what's the first thing to do?" asked Tom, after a pause.

"The first thing would be to go to Shagmon, or close to it, I should
say," remarked Mr. Sharp. "In what direction is it, Mr. Damon?"

"Northwest from where we were. It's a county seat, and that will suit
our plans admirably, for we can call on the sheriff for help."

"That is if we locate the gang," put in Tom. "I fancy it will be no
easy job, though. How are we going about it?"

"Let's first get to Shagmon," suggested the balloonist. "We'll select
some quiet spot for a landing, and then talk matters over. We may
stumble on the gang, just as you did, Tom, on the men in the office."

"No such good luck, I'm afraid."

"Well, I think we'll all be better for a little sleep," declared the
eccentric man. "Bless my eyelids but I'm tired out."

As there was no necessity for standing watch, when the airship was so
high up as to be almost invisible, they all turned in, and were soon
sleeping soundly, though Tom had hard work at first to compose himself,
for he was excited at the prospect of capturing the scoundrels,
recovering the money for the bank, and clearing his good name, as well
as those of his friends.

In the morning careful calculations were made to enable the travelers
to tell when they had reached a point directly over the small city of
Shagmon, and, with the skill of the veteran balloonist to aid them,
this was accomplished. The airship was headed in the proper direction,
and, about ten o'clock, having made out by using telescopes, that there
was plenty of uninhabited land about the city, the craft was sent aloft
again, out of a large crowd that had caught sight of it.  For it was
the intention of the travelers not to land until after dark, as they
wanted to keep their arrival quiet. There were two reasons for this.
One was that the whole country was eager to arrest them, to claim the
reward offered by the bank, and they did not want this to happen. The
other reason was that they wanted to go quietly into town, tell the
sheriff their story, and enlist his aid.

All that day the Red Cloud consorted with the masses of fleecy vapor,
several miles above the earth, a position being maintained, as nearly
as could be judged by instruments, over a patch of woodland where Mr.
Sharp had decided to land, as there were several large clearings in it.
Back and forth above the clouds, out of sight, the airship drifted
lazily to and fro; sometimes, when she got too far off her course,
being brought back to the right spot by means of the propellers.

It was tedious waiting, but they felt it was the only thing to do. Mr.
Sharp and Tom busied themselves making adjustments to several parts of
apparatus that needed it. Nothing could be done toward repairing the
hole in the aluminum container until a shop or shed was reached, but
the ship really did not need these repairs to enable it to be used.
Mr. Damon was fretful, and "blessed" so many things during the course
of the day that there seemed to be nothing left. Dinner and supper took
up some time, really good meals being served by Tom, who was
temporarily acting as cook. Then they anxiously waited for darkness,
when they could descend.

"I hope the moon isn't too bright," remarked Mr. Sharp, as he went
carefully over the motor once more, for he did not want it to balk
again. "If it shines too much it will discover us."

"But a little light would be a fine thing, and show us a good place to
land," argued Tom.

Fortune seemed to favor the adventurers. There was a hazy light from
the moon, which was covered by swiftly moving dark clouds, now and
then, a most effective screen for the airship, as its great, moving
shape, viewed from the earth, resembled nothing so much as one of the
clouds.

They made a good landing in a little forest glade, the craft, under the
skillful guidance of Mr. Sharp and Tom, coming down nicely.

"Now for a trip to town to notify the sheriff," said Mr. Sharp. "Tom, I
think you had better go alone. You can explain matters, and Mr. Damon
and I will remain here until you come back. I should say what you had
best do, would be to get the sheriff to help you locate the gang of
bank robbers. They're in this vicinity and he ought to be able, with
his deputies, to find them."

"I'll ask him," replied Tom, as he set off.

It was rather a lonely walk into the city, from the woods where the
airship had landed, but Tom did not mind it, and, reaching Shagmon, he
inquired his way to the home of the sheriff, for it was long after
office hours. He heard, as he walked along the streets, many persons
discussing the appearance of the airship that morning, and he was glad
they had planned to land after dark, for more than one citizen was
regretting that he had not had a chance to get the five thousand
dollars reward offered for the arrest of the passengers in the Red
Cloud.

Tom found the sheriff, Mr. Durkin by name, a genial personage. At the
mention of the airship the official grew somewhat excited.

"Are you one of the fellows that looted the bank?" he inquired, when
Tom told him how he and his friends had arrived at Shagmon.

The young inventor denied the impeachment, and told his story. He ended
up with a request for the sheriff's aid, at the same time asking if the
officer knew where such a gang as the Happy Harry one might be in
hiding.

"You've come just at the right time, young man," was the answer of
Sheriff Durkin, when he was assured of the honesty of Tom's statements.
"I've been on the point, for the last week, of raiding a camp of men,
who have settled at a disused summer resort about ten miles from here.
I think they're running a gambling game. But I haven't been able to get
any evidence, and every time I sent out a posse some one warns the men,
and we can find nothing wrong. I believe these men are the very ones
you want. If we could only get to them without their suspecting it, I
think I'd have them right."

"We can do that, Sheriff."

"How?"

"Go in our airship! You come with us, and we'll put you right over
their camp, where you can drop down on their heads."

"Good land, I never rode in an automobile even, let alone an airship!"
went on the officer. "I'd be scared out of my wits, and so would my
deputies."

"Send the deputies on ahead," suggested Tom.

The sheriff hesitated. Then he slapped his thigh with his big hand.

"By golly! I'll go with you!" he declared. "I'll try capturing criminals in
an airship for the first time in my life! Lead the way, young man!"

An hour later Sheriff Durkin was aboard the Red Cloud, and plans were
being talked of for the capture of the bank robbers, or at least for
raiding the camp where the men were supposed to be.




Chapter 23

On To The Camp


"Well, you sure have got a fine craft here," remarked Sheriff Durkin,
as he looked over the airship after Tom and his friends had told of
their voyage. "It will be quite up-to-date to raid a gang of bank
robbers in a flying machine, but I guess it will be the only way we can
catch those fellows. Now I'll go back to town, and the first thing in
the morning I'll round-up my posse and start it off. The men can
surround the camp, and lay quiet until we arrive in this ship. Then,
when we descend on the heads of the scoundrels, right out of the sky,
so to speak, my men can close in, and bag them all."

"That's a good plan," commented Mr. Sharp, "but are you sure these are
the men we want? It's pretty vague, I think, but of course the clue Tom
got is pretty slim; merely the name Shagmon."

"Well, this is Shagmon," went on the sheriff, "and, as I told your
young friend, I've been trying for some time to bag the men at the
summer camp. They number quite a few, and if they don't do anything
worse, they run a gambling game there. I'm pretty sure, if the bank
robbers are in this vicinity, they're in that camp. Of course all the
men there may not have been engaged in looting the vault, and they may
not all know of it, but it won't do any harm to round-up the whole
bunch."

After a tour of the craft, and waiting to take a little refreshment
with his new friends, the sheriff left, promising to come as early on
the morrow as possible.

"Let's go to bed," suggested Mr. Sharp, after a bit. "We've got hard
work ahead of us to-morrow."

They were up early, and, in the seclusion of the little glade in the
woods, Tom and Mr. Sharp went over every part of the airship.

The sheriff arrived about nine o'clock, and announced that he had
started off through the woods, to surround the camp, twenty-five men.

"They'll be there at noon," Mr. Durkin said, "and will close in when I
give the signal, which will be two shots fired. I heard just before I
came here that there are some new arrivals at the camp."

"Maybe those are the men I overheard talking in the office building,"
suggested Tom. "They probably came to get their share. Well, we must
swoop down on them before they have time to distribute the money."

"That's what!" agreed the county official. Mr. Durkin was even more
impressed by the airship in the daytime than he had been at night. He
examined every part, and when the time came to start, he was almost as
unconcerned as any of the three travelers who had covered many hundreds
of miles in the air.

"This is certainly great!" cried the sheriff, as the airship rose
swiftly under the influence of the powerful gas.

As the craft went higher and higher his enthusiasm grew.  He was not
the least afraid, but then Sheriff Durkin was accounted a nervy
individual under all circumstances.

"Lay her a little off to the left," the officer advised Tom who was at
the steering wheel. "The main camp is right over there. How long before
we will reach it?"

"We can get there in about fifteen minutes, if we run at top speed,"
answered the lad, his hand on the switch that controlled the motor.
"Shall we?"

"No use burning up the air. Besides, my men have hardly had time to
surround the camp. It's in deep woods. If I were you I'd get right over
it, and then rise up out of sight so they can't see you. Then, when
it's noon you can go down, I'll fire the signal and the fun will
commence--that is, fun for us, but not so much for those chaps, I
fancy," and the sheriff smiled grimly.

The sheriff's plan was voted a good one, and, accordingly, the ship,
after nearing a spot about over the camp, was sent a mile or two into
the air, hovering as nearly as possible over one spot.

Shortly before twelve, the sheriff having seen to the weapons he
brought with him, gave the signal to descend. Down shot the Red Cloud
dropping swiftly when the gas was allowed to escape from the red
container, and also urged toward the earth by the deflected rudder.

"Are you all ready?" cried the sheriff, looking at his watch.

"All ready," replied Mr. Sharp.

"Then here goes," went on the officer, drawing his revolver, and firing
two shots in quick succession.

Two shots from the woods below answered him. Faster dropped the Red
Cloud toward the camp of the criminals.




Chapter 24

The Raid


"Look for a good place to land!" cried Mr. Sharp to Tom. "Any small,
level place will do. Turn on the gas full power as soon as you feel the
first contact, and then shut it off so as to hold her down. Then jump
out and take a hand in the fight!"

"That's right," cried the sheriff. "Fight's the word! They're breaking
from cover now," he added, as he looked over the side of the cabin,
from one of the windows. "The rascals have taken the alarm!"

The airship was descending toward a little glade in the woods
surrounding the old picnic ground. Men, mostly of the tramp sort, could
be seen running to and fro.

"I hope my deputies close in promptly," murmured the sheriff. "There's
a bigger bunch there than I counted on."

From the appearance of the gang rushing about it seemed as if there
were at least fifty of them. Some of the fellows caught sight of the
airship, and, with yells, pointed upward.

Nearer and nearer to the earth settled the Red Cloud. The criminals in
the camp were running wildly about. Several squads of them darted
through the woods, only to come hurriedly back, where they called to
their companions.

"Ha! My men are evidently on the job!" exclaimed the sheriff. "They are
turning the rascals back!"

Some of the gang were so alarmed at the sight of the great airship
settling down on their camp, that they could only stand and stare at
it. Others were gathering sticks and stones, as if for resistance, and
some could be seen to have weapons. Off to one side was a small hut,
rather better than the rest of the tumbledown shacks in which the
tramps lived. Tom noticed this, and saw several men gathered about it.
One seemed familiar to the lad. He called the attention of Mr. Damon to
the fellow.

"Do you know him?" asked Tom eagerly.

"Bless my very existence! If it isn't Anson Morse! One of the gang!"
cried the eccentric man.

"That's what I thought," agreed Tom. "The bank robbers are here," he
added, to the sheriff.

"If we only recover the money we'll be doing well," remarked Mr. Sharp.

Suddenly there came a shout from the fringe of woods surrounding the
camp, and an instant later there burst from the bushes a number of men.

"My posse!" cried the sheriff. "We ought to be down now!"

The airship was a hundred feet above the ground, but Tom, opening wider
the gas outlet, sent the craft more quickly down. Then, just as it
touched the earth, he forced a mass of vapor into the container, making
the ship buoyant so as to reduce the shock.

An instant later the ship was stationary.

Out leaped the sheriff.

"Give it to 'em, men!" he shouted.

With a yell his men responded, and fired a volley in the air.

"Come on, Tom!" called Mr. Sharp. "We'll make for the hut where you saw
Morse."

"I'll come too! I'll come too!" cried Mr. Damon, rushing along as fast
as he could, a seltzer bottle in either hand.

Tom's chief interest was to reach the men he suspected were the bank
robbers. The lad dashed through the woods toward the hut near which he
had seen Morse. He and Mr. Sharp reached it about the same time. As
they came in front of it out dashed Happy Harry, the tramp. He was
followed by Morse and the man named Featherton. The latter carried a
black valise.

"Hey! Drop that!" shouted Mr. Sharp.

"Drop nothing!" yelled the man.

"Go on! Go on!" urged Morse. "Take to the woods! We'll deal with these
fellows!"

"Oh, you will, eh?" shouted Tom, and remembering his football days he
made a dive between Morse and Happy Harry for the man with the bag,
which he guessed contained the stolen money. The lad made a good
tackle, and grabbed Featherton about the legs. He went down in a heap,
with Tom on top. Our hero was feeling about for the valise, when he
felt a stunning blow on the back of his head. He turned over quickly to
see Morse in the act of delivering a second kick. Tom grew faint, and
dimly saw the leader of the gang reach down for the valise.

This gave our hero sudden energy. He was not going to lose everything,
when it was just within his grasp. Conquering, by a strong effort, his
feeling of dizziness, he scrambled to his feet, and made a grab for
Morse. The latter fended him off, but Tom came savagely back at him,
all his fighting blood up. The effects of the cowardly blow were
passing off.

The lad managed to get one hand on the handle of the bag.

"Let go!" cried Morse, and he dealt Tom a blow in the face. It
staggered the youth, but he held on grimly, and raised his left hand
and arm as a guard. At the same time he endeavored to twist the valise
loose from Morse's hold. The man raised his foot to kick Tom, but at
that moment there was a curious hissing sound, and a stream of frothy
liquid shot over the lad's head right into the face of the man,
blinding him.

"Ha! Take that! And more of it!" shouted Mr. Damon, and a second stream
of seltzer squirted into the face of Morse.

With a yell of rage he let go his hold of the satchel, and Tom
staggered back with it. The lad saw Mr. Damon rushing toward the now
disabled leader, playing both bottles of seltzer on him. Then, when all
the liquid was gone the eccentric man began to beat Morse over the head
and shoulders with the heavy bottles until the scoundrel begged for
mercy.

Tom was congratulating himself on his success in getting the bag when
Happy Harry, the tramp, rushed at him.

"I guess I'll take that!" he roared, and, wheeling Tom around, at the
same time striking him full in the face, the ugly man made a grab for
the valise.

His hand had hardly touched it before he went down like a log, the
sound of a powerful blow causing Tom to look up. He saw Mr. Sharp
standing over the prostrate tramp, who had been cleanly knocked out.

"Are you all right, Tom?" asked the balloonist.

"Yes--trifle dizzy, that's all--I've got the money!"

"Are you sure?"

Tom opened the valise. A glance was enough to show that it was stuffed
with bills.

Happy Harry showed signs of coming to, and Mr. Sharp, with a few turns
of a rope he had brought along, soon secured him. Morse was too
exhausted to fight more, for the seltzer entering his mouth and nose,
had deprived him of breath, and he fell an easy prisoner to Mr. Damon.

Morse was soon tied up. The other members of the Happy Harry gang had
escaped.

Meanwhile the sheriff and his men were having a fight with the crowd of
tramps, but as the posse was determined and the criminals mostly of the
class known as "hobos," the battle was not a very severe one.  Several
of the sheriff's men were slightly injured, however, and a few of the
tramps escaped.

"A most successful raid," commented the sheriff, when quiet was
restored, and a number of prisoners were lined up, all tied securely.
"Did you get the money?"

"Almost all of it," answered Tom, who, now that Morse and Happy Harry
were securely tied, had busied himself, with the aid of Mr. Sharp and
Mr. Damon, in counting the bills. "Only about two thousand dollars are
missing. I think the bank will be glad enough to charge that to profit
and loss."

"I guess so," added the sheriff. "I'm certainly much obliged to you for
the use of your airship. Otherwise the raid wouldn't have been so
successful. Well, now we'll get the prisoners to jail."

It was necessary to hire rigs from nearby farmers to accomplish this.
As for Morse and Happy Harry, they were placed in the airship, and,
under guard of the sheriff and two deputies, were taken to the county
seat. The criminals were too dazed over the rough treatment they had
received, and over their sudden capture, to notice the fact of riding
through the air to jail.

"Now for home!" cried Tom, when the prisoners had been disposed of.
"Home to clear our names and take this money to the bank!"

"And receive the reward," added Mr. Sharp, with a smile. "Don't forget
that!"

"Oh, yes, and I'll see that you get a share too, Mr. Durkin," went on
Tom. "Only for your aid we never would have gotten these men and the
money."

"Oh, I guess we're about even on that score," responded the official.
"I'm glad to break up that gang."

The next morning Tom and his friends started for home in the Red Cloud.

They took with them evidence as to the guilt of the two men--Morse and
Happy Harry. The men confessed that they and their pals had robbed the
bank of Shopton, the night before Tom and his friends sailed on their
trip. In fact that was the object for which the gang hung around
Shopton. After securing their booty they had gone to the camp of the
tramps at Shagmon, where they hid, hoping they would not be traced.
But the words Tom had overheard had been their undoing. The men who
arrived at the camp just before the raid were the same ones the young
inventor heard talking in the office building. They had come to get
their share of the loot, which Morse held, and with which he tried so
desperately to get away. Tom's injuries were not serious and did not
bother him after being treated by a physician.




Chapter 25

Andy Gets His Reward


Flying swiftly through the air the young inventor and his two
companions were soon within sight of Shopton. As they approached the
town from over the lake, and a patch of woods, they attracted no
attention until they were near home, and the craft settled down easily
in the yard of the Swift property.

That the aged inventor was glad to see his son back need not be said,
and Mrs. Baggert's welcome was scarcely less warm than that of Mr.
Swift. Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon were also made to feel that their
friends were glad to see them safe again.

"We must go at once and see Mr. Pendergast, the bank president,"
declared Mr. Swift. "We must take the money to him, and demand that he
withdraw the offer of reward for your arrest."

"Yes," agreed Tom. "I guess the reward will go to some one besides Andy
Foger."

There was considerable surprise on the part of the bank clerks when our
hero, and his friends, walked in, carrying a heavy black bag. But they
could only conjecture what was in the wind, for the party was
immediately closeted with the president.

Mr. Pendergast was so startled that he hardly knew what to say when
Tom, aided by Mr. Sharp, told his story. But the return of the money,
with documents from Sheriff Durkin, certifying as to the arrest of
Morse and Happy Harry, soon convinced him of the truth of the account.

"It's the most wonderful thing I ever heard," said the president.

"Well, what are you going to do about it?" asked Mr. Damon. "You have
accused Tom and myself of being thieves, and--"

"I apologize--I apologize most humbly!" exclaimed Mr. Pendergast. "I
also--"

"What about the reward?" went on Mr. Damon. "Bless my bank notes, I
don't want any of it, for I have enough, but I think Tom and Mr. Sharp
and the sheriff are entitled to it."

"Certainly," said the president, "certainly. It will be paid at once.
I will call a meeting of the directors. In fact they are all in the
bank now, save Mr. Foger, and I can reach him by telephone. If you will
just rest yourselves in that room there I will summon you before the
board, when it convenes, and be most happy to pay over the five
thousand dollars reward. It is the most wonderful thing I ever heard
of--most wonderful!"

In a room adjoining that of the president, Tom, his father and Mr.
Damon waited for the directors to meet. Mr. Foger could be heard
entering a little later.

"What's this I hear, Pendergast?" he cried, rubbing his hands. "The
bank robbers captured, eh? Well, that's good news. Of course we'll pay
the reward. I always knew my boy was a smart lad. Five thousand dollars
will be a tidy sum for him. Of course his chum, Sam Snedecker is
entitled to some, but not much. So they've caught Tom Swift and that
rascally Damon, eh? I always knew he was a scoundrel! Putting money in
here as a blind!"

Mr. Damon heard, and shook his fist.

"I'll make him suffer for that," he whispered.

"Tom Swift arrested, eh?" went on Mr. Foger. "I always knew he was a
bad egg. Who caught them? Where are they?"

"In the next room," replied Mr. Pendergast, who loved a joke almost as
well as did Tom. "They may come out now," added the president, opening
the door, and sending Ned Newton in to summon Tom, Mr. Swift and Mr.
Damon, who filed out before the board of directors.

"Gentlemen," began the president, "I have the pleasure of presenting to
you Mr. Thomas Swift, Mr. Barton Swift and Mr. Wakefield Damon. I also
have the honor to announce that Mr. Thomas Swift and Mr. Damon have
been instrumental in capturing the burglars who recently robbed our
bank, and I am happy to add that young Mr. Swift and Mr. Wakefeld Damon
have, this morning, brought to me all but a small part of the money
stolen from us. Which money they succeeded, after a desperate fight."

"A fight partly with seltzer bottles," interrupted Mr. Damon proudly.
"Don't forget them."

"Partly with seltzer bottles," conceded the president with a smile.
"After a fight they succeeded in getting the money back. Here it is,
and I now suggest that we pay the reward we promised."

"What? Reward? Pay them? The money back? Isn't my son to receive the
five thousand dollars for informing as to the identity of the
thief--isn't he?" demanded Mr. Foger, almost suffocating from his
astonishment at the unexpected announcement.

"Hardly," answered Mr. Pendergast dryly. "Your son's information
happened to be very wrong. The tools he saw Tom have in the bag were
airship tools, not burglar's. And the same gang that once robbed Mr.
Swift robbed our bank. Tom Swift captured them, and is entitled to the
reward. It will be necessary for us directors to make up the sum,
personally, and I, for one, am very glad to do so."

"So am I," came in a chorus from the others seated at the table.

"But--er--I understood that my son--" stammered Mr. Foger, who did not
at all relish having to see his son lose the reward.

"It was all a mistake about your son," commented Mr. Pendergast.
"Gentlemen, is it your desire that I write out a check for young Mr.
Swift?"

They all voted in the affirmative, even Mr. Foger being obliged to do
so, much against his wishes. He was a very much chagrined man, when the
directors' meeting broke up. Word was sent at once, by telegraph, to
all the cities where reward posters had been displayed, recalling the
offer, and stating that Tom Swift and Mr. Damon were cleared. Mr. Sharp
had never been really accused.

"Well, let's go home," suggested Tom when he had the
five-thousand-dollar check in his pocket.

"I want another ride in the Red Cloud as soon as it's repaired."

"So do I!" declared Mr. Damon.

The eccentric man and Mr. Swift walked on ahead, and Tom strolled down
toward the dock, for he thought he would take a short trip in his
motor-boat.

He was near the lake, not having met many persons, when he saw a figure
running up from the water. He knew who it was in an instant Andy Foger.
As for the bully, at the sight of Tom he hesitated, than came boldly
on. Evidently he had not heard of our hero's arrival.

"Ha!" exclaimed the red-haired lad, "I've been looking for you. The
police want you, Tom Swift."

"Oh, do they?" asked the young inventor gently.

"Yes; for robbery. I'm going to get the reward, too. You thought you
were smart, but I saw those burglar tools in your valise. I sent the
police after you. So you've come back, eh? I'm going to tell Chief
Simonson. You wait."

"Yes," answered Tom, "I'll wait. So the police want me, do they?"

"That's what they do," snarled Andy. "I told you I'd get even with you,
and I've done it."

"Well," burst out Tom, unable to longer contain himself, as he thought
of all he had suffered at the hands of the red-haired bully, "I said
I'd get even with you, but I haven't done it yet. I'm going to now.
Take off your coat, Andy. You and I are going to have a little
argument."

"Don't you dare lay a finger on me!" blustered the squint-eyed one.

Tom peeled off his coat. Andy, who saw that he could not escape, rushed
forward, and dealt the young inventor a blow on the chest. That was all
Tom wanted, and the next instant he went at Andy hammer and tongs. The
bully tried to fight, but he had no chance with his antagonist, who was
righteously angry, and who made every blow tell.  It was a
sorry-looking Andy Foger who begged for mercy a little later.

Tom had no desire to administer more than a deserved reward to the
bully, but perhaps he did add a little for interest. At any rate Andy
thought so.

"You just wait!" he cried, as he limped off. "I'll make you sorry for
this."

"Oh, don't go to any trouble on my account," said Tom gently, as he put
on his coat. But Andy did go to considerable trouble to be revenged on
the young inventor, and whether he succeeded or not you may learn by
reading the fourth book of this series, to be called "Tom Swift and His
Submarine Boat; or, Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure," in which I
shall relate the particulars of a voyage that was marvelous in the
extreme.

Tom reached home in a very pleasant frame of mind that afternoon.
Things had turned out much better than he thought they would. A few
weeks later the two bank robbers, who were found guilty, were sentenced
to long terms, but their companions were not captured. Tom sent Sheriff
Durkin a share of the reward, and the lad invested his own share in
bank stock, after giving some to Mr. Sharp. Mr. Damon refused to accept
any. As for Mr. Swift, once he saw matters straightened out, and his
son safe, he resumed his work on his prize submarine boat, his son
helping him.

As for Tom, he alternated his spare time between trips in the airship
and his motor-boat, and frequently a certain young lady from the
Rocksmond Seminary was his companion. I think you know her name by this
time. Now, for a while, we will take leave of Tom Swift and his
friends, trusting to meet them again.

TOM SWIFT AND HIS SUBMARINE BOAT




Chapter One

News of a Treasure Wreck


There was a rushing, whizzing, throbbing noise in the air.  A great
body, like that of some immense bird, sailed along, casting a grotesque
shadow on the ground below.  An elderly man, who was seated on the
porch of a large house, started to his feet in alarm.

"Gracious goodness! What was that, Mrs. Baggert?" he called to a
motherly-looking woman who stood in the doorway.  "What happened?"

"Nothing much, Mr. Swift," was the calm reply "I think that was Tom and
Mr. Sharp in their airship, that's all. I didn't see it, but the noise
sounded like that of the Red Cloud."

"Of course! To be sure!" exclaimed Mr. Barton Swift, the well-known
inventor, as he started down the path in order to get a good view of
the air, unobstructed by the trees. "Yes, there they are," he added.
"That's the airship, but I didn't expect them back so soon. They must
have made good time from Shopton. I wonder if anything can be the
matter that they hurried so?"

He gazed aloft toward where a queerly-shaped machine was circling about
nearly five hundred feet in the air, for the craft, after swooping down
close to the house, had ascended and was now hovering just above the
line of breakers that marked the New Jersey seacoast, where Mr. Swift
had taken up a temporary residence.

"Don't begin worrying, Mr. Swift," advised Mrs. Baggert, the
housekeeper. "You've got too much to do, if you get that new boat done,
to worry."

"That's so. I must not worry. But I wish Tom and Mr. Sharp would land,
for I want to talk to them."

As if the occupants of the airship had heard the words of the aged
inventor, they headed their craft toward earth. The combined aeroplane
and dirigible balloon, a most wonderful traveler of the air, swung
around, and then, with the deflection rudders slanted downward, came on
with a rush.  When near the landing place, just at the side of the
house, the motor was stopped, and the gas, with a hissing noise, rushed
into the red aluminum container. This immediately made the ship more
buoyant and it landed almost as gently as a feather.

No sooner had the wheels which formed the lower part of the craft
touched the ground than there leaped from the cabin of the Red Cloud a
young man.

"Well, dad!" he exclaimed. "Here we are again, safe and sound. Made a
record, too. Touched ninety miles an hour at times--didn't we, Mr.
Sharp?"

"That's what," agreed a tall, thin, dark-complexioned man, who followed
Tom Swift more leisurely in his exit from the cabin. Mr. Sharp, a
veteran aeronaut, stopped to fasten guy ropes from the airship to
strong stakes driven into the ground.

"And we'd have done better, only we struck a hard wind against us about
two miles up in the air, which delayed us," went on Tom. "Did you hear
us coming, dad?"

"Yes, and it startled him," put in Mrs. Baggert. "I guess he wasn't
expecting you."

"Oh, well, I shouldn't have been so alarmed, only I was thinking deeply
about a certain change I am going to make in the submarine, Tom. I was
day-dreaming, I think, when your ship whizzed through the air. But tell
me, did you find everything all right at Shopton? No signs of any of
those scoundrels of the Happy Harry gang having been around?" and Mr.
Swift looked anxiously at his son.

"Not a sign, dad," replied Tom quickly. "Everything was all right. We
brought the things you wanted. They're in the airship. Oh, but it was a
fine trip. I'd like to take another right out to sea."

"Not now, Tom," said his father. "I want you to help me.  And I need
Mr. Sharp's help, too. Get the things out of the car, and we'll go to
the shop."

"First I think we'd better put the airship away," advised Mr. Sharp. "I
don't just like the looks of the weather, and, besides, if we leave the
ship exposed we'll be sure to have a crowd around sooner or later, and
we don't want that."

"No, indeed," remarked the aged inventor hastily. "I don't want people
prying around the submarine shed. By all means put the airship away,
and then come into the shop."

In spite of its great size the aeroplane was easily wheeled along by
Tom and Mr. Sharp, for the gas in the container made it so buoyant that
it barely touched the earth. A little more of the powerful vapor and
the Red Cloud would have risen by itself. In a few minutes the
wonderful craft, of which my readers have been told in detail in a
previous volume, was safely housed in a large tent, which was securely
fastened.

Mr. Sharp and Tom, carrying some bundles which they had taken from the
car, or cabin, of the craft, went toward a large shed, which adjoined
the house that Mr. Swift had hired for the season at the seashore. They
found the lad's father standing before a great shape, which loomed up
dimly in the semi-darkness of the building. It was like an immense
cylinder, pointed at either end, and here and there were openings,
covered with thick glass, like immense, bulging eyes. From the number
of tools and machinery all about the place, and from the appearance of
the great cylinder itself, it was easy to see that it was only partly
completed.

"Well, how goes it, dad?" asked the youth, as he deposited his bundle
on a bench. "Do you think you can make it work?"

"I think so, Tom. The positive and negative plates are giving me
considerable trouble, though. But I guess we can solve the problem. Did
you bring me the galvanometer?"

"Yes, and all the other things," and the young inventor proceeded to
take the articles from the bundles he carried.

Mr. Swift looked them over carefully, while Tom walked about examining
the submarine, for such was the queer craft that was contained in the
shed.  He noted that some progress had been made on it since he had
left the seacoast several days before to make a trip to Shopton, in New
York State, where the Swift home was located, after some tools and
apparatus that his father wanted to obtain from his workshop there.

"You and Mr. Jackson have put on several new plates," observed the lad
after a pause.

"Yes," admitted his father. "Garret and I weren't idle, were we,
Garret?" and he nodded to the aged engineer, who had been in his employ
for many years.

"No; and I guess we'll soon have her in the water, Tom, now that you
and Mr. Sharp are here to help us," replied Garret Jackson.

"We ought to have Mr. Damon here to bless the submarine and his liver
and collar buttons a few times," put in Mr. Sharp, who brought in
another bundle. He referred to an eccentric individual who had recently
made an airship voyage with himself and Tom, Mr. Damon's peculiarity
being to use continually such expressions as: "Bless my soul! Bless my
liver!"

"Well, I'll be glad when we can make a trial trip," went on Tom. "I've
traveled pretty fast on land with my motorcycle, and we certainly have
hummed through the air. Now I want to see how it feels to scoot along
under water."

"Well, if everything goes well we'll be in position to make a trial
trip inside of a month," remarked the aged inventor. "Look here, Mr.
Sharp, I made a change in the steering gear, which I'd like you and Tom
to consider."

The three walked around to the rear of the odd-looking structure, if an
object shaped like a cigar can be said to have a front and rear, and
the inventor, his son, and the aeronaut were soon deep in a discussion
of the technicalities connected with under-water navigation.

A little later they went into the house, in response to a summons from
the supper bell, vigorously rung by Mrs. Baggert. She was not fond of
waiting with meals, and even the most serious problem of mechanics was,
in her estimation, as nothing compared with having the soup get cold,
or the possibility of not having the meat done to a turn.

The meal was interspersed with remarks about the recent airship flight
of Tom and Mr. Sharp, and discussions about the new submarine. This
talk went on even after the table was cleared off and the three had
adjourned to the sitting-room. There Mr. Swift brought out pencil and
paper, and soon he and Mr. Sharp were engrossed in calculating the
pressure per square inch of sea water at a depth of three miles.

"Do you intend to go as deep as that?" asked Tom, looking up from a
paper he was reading.

"Possibly," replied his father; and his son resumed his perusal of the
sheet.

"Now," went on the inventor to the aeronaut, "I have another plan. In
addition to the positive and negative plates which will form our motive
power, I am going to install forward and aft propellers, to use in case
of accident."

"I say, dad! Did you see this?" suddenly exclaimed Tom, getting up from
his chair, and holding his finger on a certain place in the page of the
paper.

"Did I see what?" asked Mr. Swift.

"Why, this account of the sinking of the treasure ship."

"Treasure ship? No. Where?"

"Listen," went on Tom. "I'll read it: 'Further advices from Montevideo,
Uruguay, South America, state that all hope has been given up of
recovering the steamship Boldero, which foundered and went down off
that coast in the recent gale.  Not only has all hope been abandoned of
raising the vessel, but it is feared that no part of the three hundred
thousand dollars in gold bullion which she carried will ever be
recovered. Expert divers who were taken to the scene of the wreck state
that the depth of water, and the many currents existing there, due to a
submerged shoal, preclude any possibility of getting at the hull. The
bullion, it is believed, was to have been used to further the interests
of a certain revolutionary faction, but it seems likely that they will
have to look elsewhere for the sinews of war.  Besides the bullion the
ship also carried several cases of rifles, it is stated, and other
valuable cargo. The crew and what few passengers the Boldero carried
were, contrary to the first reports, all saved by taking to the boats.
It appears that some of the ship's plates were sprung by the stress in
which she labored in a storm, and she filled and sank gradually.'
There! what do you think of that, dad?" cried Tom as he finished.

"What do I think of it? Why, I think it's too bad for the
revolutionists, Tom, of course."

"No; I mean about the treasure being still on board the ship. What
about that?"

"Well, it's likely to stay there, if the divers can't get at it. Now,
Mr. Sharp, about the propellers--"

"Wait, dad!" cried Tom earnestly.

"Why, Tom, what's the matter?" asked Mr. Swift in some surprise.

"How soon before we can finish our submarine?" went on Tom, not
answering the question.

"About a month. Why?"

"Why? Dad, why can't we have a try for that treasure? It ought to be
comparatively easy to find that sunken ship off the coast of Uruguay.
In our submarine we can get close up to it, and in the new diving suits
you invented we can get at that gold bullion. Three hundred thousand
dollars! Think of it, dad! Three hundred thousand dollars! We could
easily claim all of it, since the owners have abandoned it, but we
would be satisfied with half. Let's hurry up, finish the submarine, and
have a try for it."

"But, Tom, you forget that I am to enter my new ship in the trials for
the prize offered by the United States Government."

"How much is the prize if you win it?" asked Tom.

"Fifty thousand dollars."

"Well, here's a chance to make three times that much at least, and
maybe more. Dad, let the Government prize go, and try for the treasure.
Will you?"

Tom looked eagerly at his father, his eyes shining with anticipation.
Mr. Swift was not a quick thinker, but the idea his son had proposed
made an impression on him. He reached out his hand for the paper in
which the young inventor had seen the account of the sunken treasure.
Slowly he read it through. Then he passed it to Mr. Sharp.

"What do you think of it?" he asked of the aeronaut.

"There's a possibility," remarked the balloonist "We might try for it.
We can easily go three miles down, and it doesn't lie as deeply as
that, if this account is true. Yes, we might try for it. But we'd have
to omit the Government contests."

"Will you, dad?" asked Tom again.

Mr. Swift considered a moment longer.

"Yes, Tom, I will," he finally decided. "Going after the treasure will
be likely to afford us a better test of the submarine than would any
Government tests. We'll try to locate the sunken Boldero."

"Hurrah!" cried the lad, taking the paper from Mr. Sharp and waving it
in the air. "That's the stuff!  Now for a search for the submarine
treasure!"




Chapter Two

Finishing the Submarine


"What's the matter?" cried Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper, hurrying in
from the kitchen, where she was washing the dishes. "Have you seen some
of those scoundrels who robbed you, Mr. Swift? If you have, the police
down here ought to--"

"No, it's nothing like that," explained Mr. Swift. "Tom has merely
discovered in the paper an account of a sunken treasure ship, and he
wants us to go after it, down under the ocean."

"Oh, dear! Some more of Captain Kidd's hidden hoard, I suppose?"
ventured the housekeeper. "Don't you bother with it, Mr. Swift. I had a
cousin once, and he got set in the notion that he knew where that
pirate's treasure was. He spent all the money he had and all he could
borrow digging for it, and he never found a penny. Don't waste your
time on such foolishness. It's bad enough to be building airships and
submarines without going after treasure."  Mrs. Baggert spoke with the
freedom of an old friend rather than a hired housekeeper, but she had
been in the family ever since Tom's mother died, when he was a baby,
and she had many privileges.

"Oh, this isn't any of Kidd's treasure," Tom assured her.  "If we get
it, Mrs. Baggert, I'll buy you a diamond ring."

"Humph!" she exclaimed, as Tom began to hug her in boyish fashion. "I
guess I'll have to buy all the diamond rings I want, if I have to
depend on your treasure for them," and she went back to the kitchen.

"Well," went on Mr. Swift after a pause, "if we are going into the
treasure-hunting business, Tom, we'll have to get right to work. In the
first place, we must find out more about this ship, and just where it
was sunk."

"I can do that part," said Mr. Sharp. "I know some sea captains, and
they can put me on the track of locating the exact spot. In fact, it
might not be a bad idea to take an expert navigator with us. I can
manage in the air all right, but I confess that working out a location
under water is beyond me."

"Yes, an old sea captain wouldn't be a bad idea, by any means,"
conceded Mr. Swift. "Well, if you'll attend to that detail, Mr. Sharp,
Tom, Mr. Jackson and I will finish the submarine. Most of the work is
done, however, and it only remains to install the engine and motors.
Now, in regard to the negative and positive electric plates, I'd like
your opinion, Tom."

For Tom Swift was an inventor, second in ability only to his father,
and his advice was often sought by his parent on matters of electrical
construction, for the lad had made a specialty of that branch of
science.

While father and son were deep in a discussion of the apparatus of the
submarine, there will be an opportunity to make the reader a little
better acquainted with them. Those of you who have read the previous
volumes of this series do not need to be told who Tom Swift is. Others,
however, may be glad to have a proper introduction to him.

Tom Swift lived with his father, Barton Swift, in the village of
Shopton, New York. The Swift home was on the outskirts of the town, and
the large house was surrounded by a number of machine shops, in which
father and son, aided by Garret Jackson, the engineer, did their
experimental and constructive work. Their house was not far from Lake
Carlopa, a fairly large body of water, on which Tom often speeded his
motor-boat.

In the first volume of this series, entitled "Tom Swift and His
Motor-Cycle," it was told how he became acquainted with Mr. Wakefield
Damon, who suffered an accident while riding one of the speedy
machines. The accident disgusted Mr. Damon with motor-cycles, and Tom
secured it for a low price. He had many adventures on it, chief among
which was being knocked senseless and robbed of a valuable patent model
belonging to his father, which he was taking to Albany. The attack was
committed by a gang known as the Happy Harry gang, who were acting at
the instigation of a syndicate of rich men, who wanted to secure
control of a certain patent turbine engine which Mr. Swift had invented.

Tom set out in pursuit of the thieves, after recovering from their
attack, and had a strenuous time before he located them.

In the second volume, entitled "Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat," there
was related our hero's adventures in a fine craft which was recovered
from the thieves and sold at auction. There was a mystery connected
with the boat, and for a long time Tom could not solve it. He was
aided, however, by his chum, Ned Newton, who worked in the Shopton
Bank, and also by Mr. Damon and Eradicate Sampson, an aged colored
whitewasher, who formed quite an attachment for Tom.

In his motor-boat Tom had more than one race with Andy Foger, a rich
lad of Shopton, who was a sort of bully. He had red hair and squinty
eyes, and was as mean in character as he was in looks. He and his
cronies, Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey, made trouble for Tom, chiefly
because Tom managed to beat Andy twice in boat races.

It was while in his motor-boat, Arrow, that Tom formed the acquaintance
of John Sharp, a veteran balloonist. While coming down Lake Carlopa on
the way to the Swift home, which had been entered by thieves, Tom, his
father and Ned Newton, saw a balloon on fire over the lake. Hanging
from a trapeze on it was Mr. Sharp, who had made an ascension from a
fair ground. By hard work on the part of Tom and his friends the
aeronaut was saved, and took up his residence with the Swifts.

His advent was most auspicious, for Tom and his father were then
engaged in perfecting an airship, and Mr. Sharp was able to lend them
his skill, so that the craft was soon constructed.

In the third volume, called "Tom Swift and His Airship," there was set
down the doings of the young inventor, Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon on a
trip above the clouds. They undertook it merely for pleasure, but they
encountered considerable danger, before they completed it, for they
nearly fell into a blazing forest once, and were later fired at by a
crowd of excited people. This last act was to effect their capture, for
they were taken for a gang of bank robbers, and this was due directly
to Andy Foger.

The morning after Tom and his friends started on their trip in the air,
the Shopton Bank was found to have been looted of seventy-five thousand
dollars. Andy Foger at once told the police that Tom Swift had taken
the money, and when asked how he knew this, he said he had seen Tom
hanging around the bank the night before the vault was burst open, and
that the young inventor had some burglar tools in his possession.
Warrants were at once sworn out for Tom and Mr. Damon, who was also
accused of being one of the robbers, and a reward of five thousand
dollars was offered.

Tom, Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp sailed on, all unaware of this, and unable
to account for being fired upon, until they accidentally read in the
paper an account of their supposed misdeeds. They lost no time in
starting back home, and on the way got on the track of the real bank
robbers, who were members of the Happy Harry gang.

How the robbers were captured in an exciting raid, how Tom recovered
most of the stolen money, and how he gave Andy Foger a deserved
thrashing for giving a false clue was told of, and there was an account
of a race in which the Red Cloud (as the airship was called) took part,
as well as details of how Tom and his friends secured the reward, which
Andy Foger hoped to collect.

Those of you who care to know how the Red Cloud was constructed, and
how she behaved in the air, even during accidents and when struck by
lightning, may learn by reading the third volume, for the airship was
one of the most successful ever constructed.

When the craft was finished, and the navigators were ready to start on
their first long trip, Mr. Swift was asked to go with them. He
declined, but would not tell why, until Tom, pressing him for an
answer, learned that his father was planning a submarine boat, which he
hoped to enter in some trials for Government prizes. Mr. Swift remained
at home to work on this submarine, while his son and Mr. Sharp were
sailing above the clouds.

On their return, however, and after the bank mystery had been cleared
up, Tom and Mr. Sharp, aided Mr. Swift in completing the submarine,
until, when the present story opens, it needed but little additional
work to make the craft ready for the water.

Of course it had to be built near the sea, as it would have been
impossible to transport it overland from Shopton.  So, before the keel
was laid, Mr. Swift rented a large cottage at a seaside place on the
New Jersey coast and there, after erecting a large shed, the work on
the Advance, as the under-water ship was called, was begun.

It was soon to be launched in a large creek that extended in from the
ocean and had plenty of water at high tide. Tom and Mr. Sharp made
several trips back and forth from Shopton in their airship, to see that
all was safe at home and occasionally to get needed tools and supplies
from the shops, for not all the apparatus could be moved from Shopton
to the coast.

It was when returning from one of these trips that Tom brought with him
the paper containing an account of the wreck of the Boldero and the
sinking of the treasure she carried.

Until late that night the three fortune-hunters discussed various
matters.

"We'll hurry work on the ship," said Mr. Swift at length.  "Tom, I
wonder if your friend, Mr. Damon, would care to try how it seems under
water? He stood the air trip fairly well."

"I'll write and ask him," answered the lad. "I'm sure he'll go."

Securing, a few days later, the assistance of two mechanics, whom he
knew he could trust, for as yet the construction of the Advance was a
secret, Mr. Swift prepared to rush work on the submarine, and for the
next three weeks there were busy times in the shed next to the seaside
cottage. So busy, in fact, were Tom and Mr. Sharp, that they only found
opportunity for one trip in the airship, and that was to get some
supplies from the shops at home.

"Well," remarked Mr. Swift one night, at the close of a hard day's
work, "another week will see our craft completed.  Then we will put it
in the water and see how it floats, and whether it submerges as I hope
it does. But come on, Tom. I want to lock up. I'm very tired to-night."

"All right, dad," answered the young inventor coming from the darkened
rear of the shop. "I just want to--"

He paused suddenly, and appeared to be listening. Then he moved softly
back to where he had come from.

"What's the matter?" asked his father in a whisper.  "What's up, Tom?"

The lad did not answer Mr. Swift, with a worried look on his face,
followed his son. Mr. Sharp stood in the door of the shop.

"I thought I heard some one moving around back here," went on Tom
quietly.

"Some one in this shop!" exclaimed the aged inventor excitedly. "Some
one trying to steal my ideas again! Mr. Sharp, come here! Bring that
rifle! We'll teach these scoundrels a lesson!"

Tom quickly darted back to the extreme rear of the building. There was
a scuffle, and the next minute Tom cried out:

"What are you doing here?"

"Ha! I beg your pardon," replied a voice. "I am looking for Mr. Barton
Swift."

"My father," remarked Tom. "But that's a queer place to look for him.
He's up front. Father, here's a man who wishes to see you," he called.

"Yes, I strolled in, and seeing no one about I went to the rear of the
place," the voice went on. "I hope I haven't transgressed."

"We were busy on the other side of the shop, I guess," replied Tom, and
he looked suspiciously at the man who emerged from the darkness into
the light from a window. "I beg your pardon for grabbing you the way I
did," went on the lad, "but I thought you were one of a gang of men
we've been having trouble with."

"Oh, that's all right," continued the man easily. "I know Mr. Swift,
and I think he will remember me. Ah, Mr. Swift, how do you do?" he
added quickly, catching sight of Tom's father, who, with Mr. Sharp, was
coming to meet the lad.

"Addison Berg!" exclaimed the aged inventor as he saw the man's face
more plainly. "What are you doing here?"

"I came to see you," replied the man. "May I have a talk with you
privately?"

"I--I suppose so," assented Mr. Swift nervously. "Come into the house."

Mr. Berg left Tom's side and advanced to where Mr. Swift was standing.
Together the two emerged from the now fast darkening shop and went
toward the house.

"Who is he?" asked Mr. Sharp of the young inventor in a whisper.

"I don't know," replied the lad; "but, whoever he is, dad seems afraid
of him. I'm going to keep my eyes open."




Chapter Three

Mr. Berg is Astonished


Following his father and the stranger whom the aged inventor had
addressed as Mr. Berg, Tom and Mr. Sharp entered the house, the lad
having first made sure that Garret Jackson was on guard in the shop
that contained the submarine.

"Now," said Mr. Swift to the newcomer, "I am at your service. What is
it you wish?"

"In the first place, let me apologize for having startled you and your
friends," began the man. "I had no idea of sneaking into your workshop,
but I had just arrived here, and seeing the doors open I went in. I
heard no one about, and I wandered to the back of the place. There I
happened to stumble over a board--"

"And I heard you," interrupted Tom.

"Is this one of your employees?" asked Mr. Berg in rather frigid tones.

"That is my son," replied Mr. Swift.

"Oh, I beg your pardon." The man's manner changed quickly.  "Well, I
guess you did hear me, young man. I didn't intend to bark my shins the
way I did, either. You must have taken me for a burglar or a sneak
thief."

"I have been very much bothered by a gang of unscrupulous men," said
Mr. Swift, "and I suppose Tom thought it was some of them sneaking
around again."

"That's what I did," added the lad. "I wasn't going to have any one
steal the secret of the submarine if I could help it."

"Quite right! Quite right!" exclaimed Mr. Berg. "But my purpose was an
open one. As you know, Mr. Swift, I represent the firm of Bentley &
Eagert, builders of submarine boats and torpedoes. They heard that you
were constructing a craft to take part in the competitive prize tests
of the United States Government, and they asked me to come and see you
to learn when your ship would be ready. Ours is completed, but we
recognize that it will be for the best interests of all concerned if
there are a number of contestants, and my firm did not want to send in
their entry until they knew that you were about finished with your
ship. How about it? Are you ready to compete?"

"Yes," said Mr. Swift slowly. "We are about ready. My craft needs a few
finishing touches, and then it will be ready to launch."

"Then we may expect a good contest on your part," suggested Mr. Berg.

"Well," began the aged inventor, "I don't know about that."

"What's that?" exclaimed Mr. Berg.

"I said I wasn't quite sure that we would compete," went on Mr. Swift.
"You see, when I first got this idea for a submarine boat I had it in
mind to try for the Government prize of fifty thousand dollars."

"That's what we want, too," interrupted Mr. Berg with a smile.

"But," went on Tom's father, "since then certain matters have come up,
and I think, on the whole, that we'll not compete for the prize after
all."

"Not compete for the prize?" almost shouted the agent for Bentley &
Eagert. "Why, the idea! You ought to compete. It is good for the trade.
We think we have a very fine craft, and probably we would beat you in
the tests, but--"

"I wouldn't be too sure of that," put in Tom. "You have only seen the
outside of our boat. The inside is better yet."

"Ah, I have no doubt of that," spoke Mr. Berg, "but we have been at the
business longer than you have, and have had more experience. Still we
welcome competition. But I am very much surprised that you are not
going to compete for the prize, Mr. Swift. Very much surprised, indeed!
You see, I came down from Philadelphia to arrange so that we could both
enter our ships at the same time. I understand there is another firm of
submarine boat builders who are going to try for the prize, and I want
to arrange a date that will be satisfactory to all. I am greatly
astonished that you are not going to compete."

"Well, we were going to," said Mr. Swift, "only we have changed our
minds, that's all. My son and I have other plans."

"May I ask what they are?" questioned Mr. Berg.

"You may," exclaimed Tom quickly; "but I don't believe we can tell you.
They're a secret," he added more cordially.

"Oh, I see," retorted Mr. Berg. "Well, of course I don't wish to
penetrate any of your secrets, but I hoped we could contest together
for the Government prize. It is worth trying for I assure you--fifty
thousand dollars. Besides, there is the possibility of selling a number
of submarines to the United States. It's a fine prize."

"But the one we are after is a bigger one," cried Tom impetuously, and
the moment he had spoken he wished he could recall the words.

"Eh? What's that?" exclaimed Mr. Berg. "You don't mean to say another
government has offered a larger prize? If I had known that I would not
have let my firm enter into the competition for the bonus offered by
the United States.  Please tell me."

"I'm sorry," went on Tom more soberly. "I shouldn't have spoken. Mr.
Berg, the plans of my father and myself are such that we can't reveal
them now. We are going to try for a prize, but not in competition with
you. It's an entirely different matter."

"Well, I guess you'll find that the firm of Bentley & Eagert are
capable of trying for any prizes that are offered," boasted the agent.
"We may be competitors yet."

"I don't believe so," replied Mr. Swift.

"We may," repeated Mr. Berg. "And if we do, please remember that we
will show no mercy. Our boats are the best."

"And may the best boat win," interjected Mr. Sharp.  "That's all we
ask. A fair field and no favors."

"Of course," spoke the agent coldly. "Is this another son of yours?" he
asked.

"No but a good friend," replied the aged inventor. "No, Mr. Berg, we
won't compete this time. You may tell your firm so."

"Very good," was the other's stiff reply. "Then I will bid you good
night. We shall carry off the Government prize, but permit me to add
that I am very much astonished, very much indeed, that you do not try
for the prize. From what I have seen of your submarine you have a very
good one, almost as good, in some respects, as ours.  I bid you good
night," and with a bow the man left the room and hurried away from the
house.




Chapter Four

Tom is Imprisoned


"Well, I must say he's a cool one," remarked Tom, as the echoes of Mr.
Berg's steps died away. "The idea of thinking his boat better than
ours! I don't like that man, dad. I'm suspicious of him. Do you think
he came here to steal some of our ideas?"

"No, I hardly believe so, my son. But how did you discover him?"

"Just as you saw, dad. I heard a noise and went back there to
investigate. I found him sneaking around, looking at the electric
propeller plates. I went to grab him just as he stumbled over a board.
At first I thought it was one of the old gang. I'm almost sure he was
trying to discover something."

"No, Tom. The firm he works for are good business men, and they would
not countenance anything like that. They are heartless competitors,
however, and if they saw a legitimate chance to get ahead of me and
take advantage, they would do it. But they would not sneak in to steal
my ideas. I feel sure of that. Besides, they have a certain type of
submarine which they think is the best ever invented, and they would
hardly change at this late day. They feel sure of winning the
Government prize, and I'm just as glad we're not going to have a
contest."

"Do you think our boat is better than theirs?"

"Much better, in many respects."

"I don't like that man Berg, though," went on Tom.

"Nor do I," added his father. "There is something strange about him.
He was very anxious that I should compete.  Probably he thought his
firm's boat would go so far ahead of ours that they would get an extra
bonus. But I'm glad he didn't see our new method of propulsion. That is
the principal improvement in the Advance over other types of
submarines. Well, another week and we will be ready for the test."

"Have you known Mr. Berg long, dad?"

"Not very. I met him in Washington when I was in the patent office. He
was taking out papers on a submarine for his firm at the same time I
got mine for the Advance. It is rather curious that he should come all
the way here from Philadelphia, merely to see if I was going to
compete. There is something strange about it, something that I can't
understand."

The time was to come when Mr. Swift and his son were to get at the
bottom of Mr. Berg's reasons, and they learned to their sorrow that he
had penetrated some of their secrets.

Before going to bed that night Tom and Mr. Sharp paid a visit to the
shed where the submarine was resting on the ways, ready for launching.
They found Mr. Jackson on guard and the engineer said that no one had
been around. Nor was anything found disturbed.

"It certainly is a great machine," remarked the lad as he looked up at
the cigar-shaped bulk towering over his head.  "Dad has outdone himself
this trip."

"It looks all right," commented Mr. Sharp. "Whether it will work is
another question."

"Yes, we can't tell until it's in the water," conceded Tom. "But I
hope it does. Dad has spent much time and money on it."

The Advance was, as her name indicated, much in advance of previous
submarines. There was not so much difference in outward construction as
there was in the means of propulsion and in the manner in which the
interior and the machinery were arranged.

The submarine planned by Mr. Swift and Tom jointly, and constructed by
them, with the aid of Mr. Sharp and Mr. Jackson, was shaped like a
Cigar, over one hundred feet long and twenty feet in diameter at the
thickest part. It was divided into many compartments, all water-tight,
so that if one or even three were flooded the ship would still be
useable.

Buoyancy was provided for by having several tanks for the introduction
of compressed air, and there was an emergency arrangement so that a
collapsible aluminum container could be distended and filled with a
powerful gas. This was to be used if, by any means, the ship was
disabled on the bottom of the ocean. The container could be expanded
and filled, and would send the Advance to the surface.

Another peculiar feature was that the engine-room, dynamos and other
apparatus were all contained amidships. This gave stability to the
craft, and also enabled the same engine to operate both shafts and
propellers, as well as both the negative forward electrical plates, and
the positive rear ones.

These plates were a new idea in submarine construction, and were the
outcome of an idea of Mr. Swift, with some suggestions from his son.

The aged inventor did not want to depend on the usual screw propellers
for his craft, nor did he want to use a jet of compressed air, shooting
out from a rear tube, nor yet a jet of water, by means of which the
creature called the squid shoots himself along. Mr. Swift planned to
send the Advance along under water by means of electricity.

Certain peculiar plates were built at the forward and aft blunt noses
of the submarine. Into the forward plate a negative charge of
electricity was sent, and into the one at the rear a positive charge,
just as one end of a horseshoe magnet is positive and will repel the
north end of a compass needle, while the other pole of a magnet is
negative and will attract it. In electricity like repels like, while
negative and positive have a mutual attraction for each other.

Mr. Swift figured out that if he could send a powerful current of
negative electricity into the forward plate it would pull the boat
along, for water is a good conductor of electricity, while if a
positive charge was sent into the rear plate it would serve to push the
submarine along, and he would thus get a pulling and pushing motion,
just as a forward and aft propeller works on some ferry boats.

But the inventor did not depend on these plates alone.  There were
auxiliary forward and aft propellers of the regular type, so that if
the electrical plates did not work, or got out of order, the screws
would serve to send the Advance along.

There was much machinery in the submarine. There were gasolene motors,
since space was too cramped to allow the carrying of coal for boilers.
There were dynamos, motors and powerful pumps. Some of these were for
air, and some for water. To sink the submarine below the surface large
tanks were filled with water. To insure a more sudden descent,
deflecting rudders were also used, similar to those on an airship.
There were also special air pumps, and one for the powerful gas, which
was manufactured on board.

Forward from the engine-room was a cabin, where meals could be served,
and where the travelers could remain in the daytime. There was also a
small cooking galley, or kitchen, there. Back of the engine-room were
the sleeping quarters and the storerooms. The submarine was steered
from the forward compartment, and here were also levers, wheels and
valves that controlled all the machinery, while a number of dials
showed in which direction they were going, how deep they were, and at
what speed they were moving, as well as what the ocean pressure was.

On top, forward, was a small conning, or observation tower, with
auxiliary and steering and controlling apparatus there. This was to be
used when the ship was moving along on the surface of the ocean, or
merely with the deck awash.  There was a small flat deck surrounding
the conning tower and this was available when the craft was on the
surface.

There was provision made for leaving the ship when it was on the bed of
the ocean. When it was desired to do this the occupants put on diving
suits, which were provided with portable oxygen tanks. Then they
entered a chamber into which water was admitted until it was equal in
pressure to that outside. Then a steel door was opened, and they could
step out. To re-enter the ship the operation was reversed.  This was
not a new feature. In fact, many submarines to-day use it.

At certain places there were thick bull's-eye windows, by means of
which the under-water travelers could look out into the ocean through
which they were moving. As a defense against the attacks of submarine
monsters there was a steel, pointed ram, like a big harpoon. There were
also a bow and a stern electrical gun, of which more will be told later.

In addition to ample sleeping accommodations, there were many
conveniences aboard the Advance. Plenty of fresh water could be
carried, and there was an apparatus for distilling more from the sea
water that surrounded the travelers.  Compressed air was carried in
large tanks, and oxygen could be made as needed. In short, nothing that
could add to the comfort or safety of the travelers had been omitted.
There was a powerful crane and windlass, which had been installed when
Mr. Swift thought his boat might be bought by the Government. This was
to be used for raising wrecks or recovering objects from the bottom of
the ocean. Ample stores and provisions were to be carried and, once the
travelers were shut up in the Advance, they could exist for a month
below the surface, providing no accident occurred.

All these things Tom and Mr. Sharp thought of as they looked over the
ship before turning in for the night. The craft was made immensely
strong to withstand powerful pressure at the bottom of the ocean. The
submarine could penetrate to a depth of about three miles. Below that
it was dangerous to go, as the awful force would crush the plates,
powerful as they were.

"Well, we'll rush things to-morrow and the next day," observed Tom as
he prepared to leave the building. "Then we'll soon see if it works."

For the next week there were busy times in the shop near the ocean.
Great secrecy was maintained, and though curiosity seekers did stroll
along now and then, they received little satisfaction. At first Mr.
Swift thought that the visit of Mr. Berg would have unpleasant results,
for he feared that the agent would talk about the craft, of which he
had so unexpectedly gotten a sight. But nothing seemed to follow from
his chance inspection, and it was forgotten.

It was one evening, about a week later, that Tom was alone in the shop.
The two mechanics that had been hired to help out in the rush had been
let go, and the ship needed but a few adjustments to make it ready for
the sea.

"I think I'll just take another look at the water tank valves," said
Tom to himself as he prepared to enter the big compartments which
received the water ballast. "I want to be sure they work properly and
quickly. We've got to depend on them to make us sink when we want to,
and, what's more important, to rise to the surface in a hurry. I've got
time enough to look them over before dad and Mr. Sharp get back."

Tom entered the starboard tank by means of an emergency sliding door
between the big compartments and the main part of the ship. This was
closed by a worm and screw gear, and once the ship was in the water
would seldom be used.

The young inventor proceeded with his task, carefully inspecting the
valves by the light of a lantern he carried.  The apparatus seemed to
be all right, and Tom was about to leave when a peculiar noise
attracted his attention. It was the sound of metal scraping on metal,
and the lad's quick and well-trained ear told him it was somewhere
about the ship.

He turned to leave the tank, but as he wheeled around his light flashed
on a solid wall of steel back of him. The emergency outlet had been
closed! He was a prisoner in the water compartment, and he knew, from
past experience, that shout as he would, his voice could not be heard
ten feet away. His father and Mr. Sharp, as he was aware, had gone to a
nearby city for some tools, and Mr. Jackson, the engineer, was
temporarily away. Mrs. Baggert, in the house, could not hear his cries.

"I'm locked in!" cried Tom aloud. "The worm gear must have shut of
itself. But I don't see how that could be. I've got to get out mighty
soon, though, or I'll smother. This tank is airtight, and it won't take
me long to breath up all the oxygen there is here. I must get that
slide open."

He sought to grasp the steel plate that closed the emergency opening.
His fingers slipped over the smooth, polished surface. He was
hermetically sealed up--a captive!  Blankly he set his lantern down and
leaned hopelessly against the wall of the tank.

"I've got to get out," he murmured.

As if in answer to him he heard a voice on the outside, crying:

"There, Tom Swift! I guess I've gotten even with you now!  Maybe next
time you won't take a reward away from me, and lick me into the
bargain. I've got you shut up good and tight, and you'll stay there
until I get ready to let you out."

"Andy Foger!" gasped Tom. "Andy Foger sneaked in here and turned the
gear. But how did he get to this part of the coast? Andy Foger, you let
me out!" shouted the young inventor; and as Andy's mocking laugh came
to him faintly through the steel sides of the submarine, the imprisoned
lad beat desperately with his hands on the smooth sides of the tank,
vainly wondering how his enemy had discovered him.




Chapter Five

Mr. Berg is Suspicious


Not for long did the young inventor endeavor to break his way out of
the water-ballast tank by striking the heavy sides of it. Tom realized
that this was worse than useless.  He listened intently, but could hear
nothing. Even the retreating footsteps of Andy Foger were inaudible.

"This certainly is a pickle!" exclaimed Tom aloud. "I can't understand
how he ever got here. He must have traced us after we went to Shopton
in the airship the last time.  Then he sneaked in here. Probably he saw
me enter, but how could he know enough to work the worm gear and close
the door? Andy has had some experience with machinery, though, and one
of the vaults in the bank where his father is a director closed just
like this tank. That's very likely how he learned about it. But I've
got to do something else besides thinking of that sneak, Andy. I've got
to get out of here. Let's see if I can work the gear from inside."

Before he started, almost, Tom knew that it would be impossible. The
tank was made to close from the interior of the submarine, and the
heavy door, built to withstand the pressure of tons of water, could not
be forced except by the proper means.

"No use trying that," concluded the lad, after a tiring attempt to
force back the sliding door with his hands. "I've got to call for help."

He shouted until the vibrations in the confined space made his ears
ring, and the mere exertion of raising his voice to the highest pitch
made his heart beat quickly. Yet there came no response. He hardly
expected that there would be any, for with his father and Mr. Sharp
away, the engineer absent on an errand, and Mrs. Baggert in the house
some distance off, there was no one to hear his calls for help, even if
they had been capable of penetrating farther than the extent of the
shed, where the under-water craft had been constructed.

"I've got to wait until some of them come out here," thought Tom.
"They'll be sure to release me and make a search. Then it will be easy
enough to call to them and tell them where I am, once they are inside
the shed. But--" He paused, for a horrible fear came over him. "Suppose
they should come--too late?" The tank was airtight. There was enough
air in it to last for some time, but, sooner or later, it would no
longer support life. Already, Tom thought, it seemed oppressive, though
probably that was his imagination.

"I must get out!" he repeated frantically. "I'll die in here soon."

Again he tried to shove back the steel door. Then he repeated his cries
until he was weary. No one answered him.  He fancied once he could hear
footsteps in the shed, and thought, perhaps, it was Andy, come back to
gloat over him.  Then Tom knew the red-haired coward would not dare
venture back. We must do Andy the justice to say that he never realized
that he was endangering Tom's life. The bully had no idea the tank was
airtight when he closed it. He had seen Tom enter and a sudden whim
came to him to revenge himself.

But that did not help the young inventor any. There was no doubt about
it now--the air was becoming close. Tom had been imprisoned nearly two
hours, and as he was a healthy, strong lad, he required plenty of
oxygen. There was certainly less than there had been in the tank. His
head began to buzz, and there was a ringing in his ears.

Once more he fell upon his knees, and his fingers sought the small
projections of the gear on the inside of the door. He could no more
budge the mechanism than a child could open a burglar-proof vault.

"It's no use," he moaned, and he sprawled at full length on the floor
of the tank, for there the air was purer. As he did so his fingers
touched something. He started as they closed around the handle of a big
monkey wrench. It was one he had brought into the place with him.
Imbued with new hope he struck a match and lighted his lantern, which
he had allowed to go out as it burned up too much of the oxygen. By the
gleam of it he looked to see if there were any bolts or nuts he could
loosen with the wrench, in order to slide the door back. It needed but
a glance to show him the futility of this.

"It's no go," he murmured, and he let the wrench fall to the floor.
There was a ringing, clanging sound, and as it smote his ears Tom
sprang up with an exclamation.

"That's the thing!" he cried. "I wonder I didn't think of it before. I
can signal for help by pounding on the sides of the tank with the
wrench. The blows will carry a good deal farther than my voice would."
Every one knows how far the noise of a boiler shop, with hammers
falling on steel plates, can be heard; much farther than can a human
voice.

Tom began a lusty tattoo on the metal sides of the tank.  At first he
merely rattled out blow after blow, and then, as another thought came
to him, he adopted a certain plan. Some time previous, when he and Mr.
Sharp had planned their trip in the air, the two had adopted a code of
signals. As it was difficult in a high wind to shout from one end of
the airship to the other, the young inventor would sometimes pound on
the pipe which ran from the pilot house of the Red Cloud to the
engine-room. By a combination of numbers, simple messages could be
conveyed. The code included a call for help. Forty-seven was the
number, but there had never been any occasion to use it.

Tom remembered this now. At once he ceased his indiscriminate
hammering, and began to beat out regularly--one, two, three, four--then
a pause, and seven blows would be given. Over and over again he rang
out this number--forty seven--the call for help.

"If Mr. Sharp only comes back he will hear that, even in the house,"
thought poor Tom "Maybe Garret or Mrs. Baggert will hear it, too, but
they won't know what it means.  They'll think I'm just working on the
submarine."

It seemed several hours to Tom that he pounded out that cry for aid,
but, as he afterward learned, it was only a little over an hour. Signal
after signal he sent vibrating from the steel sides of the tank. When
one arm tired he would use the other. He grew weary, his head was
aching, and there was a ringing in his ears; a ringing that seemed as
if ten thousand bells were jangling out their peals, and he could
barely distinguish his own pounding.

Signal after signal he sounded. It was becoming like a dream to him,
when suddenly, as he paused for a rest, he heard his name called
faintly, as if far away.

"Tom! Tom! Where are you?"

It was the voice of Mr. Sharp. Then followed the tones of the aged
inventor.

"My poor boy! Tom, are you still alive?"

"Yes, dad! In the starboard tank!" the lad gasped out, and then he lost
his senses. When he revived he was lying on a pile of bagging in the
submarine shop, and his father and the aeronaut were bending over him.

"Are you all right, Tom?" asked Mr. Swift.

"Yes--I--I guess so," was the hesitating answer. "Yes," the lad added,
as the fresh air cleared his head. "I'll be all right pretty soon. Have
you seen Andy Foger?"

"Did he shut you in there?" demanded Mr. Swift.

Tom nodded.

"I'll have him arrested!" declared Mr. Swift. "I'll go to town as soon
as you're in good shape again and notify the police."

"No, don't," pleaded Tom. "I'll take care of Andy myself.  I don't
really believe he knew how serious it was. I'll settle with him later,
though."

"Well, it came mighty near being serious," remarked Mr. Sharp grimly.
"Your father and I came back a little sooner than we expected, and as
soon as I got near the house I heard your signal. I knew what it was in
a moment. There were Mrs. Baggert and Garret talking away, and when I
asked them why they didn't answer your call they said they thought you
were merely tinkering with the machinery. But I knew better. It's the
first time we ever had a use for 'forty-seven,' Tom."

"And I hope it will be the last," replied the young inventor with a
faint smile. "But I'd like to know what Andy Foger is doing in this
neighborhood."

Tom was soon himself again and able to go to the house, where he found
Mrs. Baggert brewing a big basin of catnip tea, under the impression
that it would in some way be good for him. She could not forgive
herself for not having answered his signal, and as for Mr. Jackson, he
had started for a doctor as soon as he learned that Tom was shut up in
the tank. The services of the medical man were canceled by telephone,
as there was no need for him, and the engineer came back to the house.

Tom was fully himself the next day, and aided his father and Mr. Sharp
in putting the finishing touches to the Advance. It was found that some
alteration was required in the auxiliary propellers, and this, much to
the regret of the young inventor, would necessitate postponing the
trial a few days.

"But we'll have her in the water next Friday," promised Mr. Swift.

"Aren't you superstitious about Friday?" asked the balloonist.

"Not a bit of it," replied the aged inventor. "Tom," he added, "I wish
you would go in the house and get me the roll of blueprints you'll find
on my desk."

As the lad neared the cottage he saw, standing in front of the place, a
small automobile. A man had just descended from it, and it needed but a
glance to show that he was Mr. Addison Berg.

"Ah, good morning, Mr. Swift," greeted Mr. Berg. "I wish to see your
father, but as I don't wish to lay myself open to suspicions by
entering the shop, perhaps you will ask him to step here."

"Certainly," answered the lad, wondering why the agent had returned.
Getting the blueprints, and asking Mr. Berg to sit down on the porch,
Tom delivered the message.

"You come back with me, Tom," said his father. "I want you to be a
witness to what he says. I'm not going to get into trouble with these
people."

Mr. Berg came to the point at once.

"Mr. Swift," he said, "I wish you would reconsider your determination
not to enter the Government trials. I'd like to see you compete. So
would my firm."

"There is no use going over that again," replied the aged inventor. "I
have another object in view now than trying for the Government prize.
What it is I can't say, but it may develop in time--if we are
successful," and he looked at his son, smiling the while.

Mr. Berg tried to argue, but it was of no avail. Then he changed his
manner, and said:

"Well, since you won't, you won't, I suppose. I'll go back and report
to my firm.  Have you anything special to do this morning?" he went on
to Tom.

"Well, I can always find something to keep me busy," replied the lad,
"but as for anything special--"

"I thought perhaps you'd like to go for a trip in my auto," interrupted
Mr. Berg. "I had asked a young man who is stopping at the same hotel
where I am to accompany me, but he has unexpectedly left, and I don't
like to go alone. His name was--let me see. I have a wretched memory
for names, but it was something like Roger or Moger."

"Foger!" cried Tom. "Was it Andy Foger?"

"Yes, that was it. Why, do you know him?" asked Mr. Berg in some
surprise.

"I should say so," replied Tom. "He was the cause of what might have
resulted in something serious for me," and the lad explained about
being imprisoned in the tank.

"You don't tell me!" cried Mr. Berg. "I had no idea he was that kind of
a lad. You see, his father is one of the directors of the firm by whom
I am employed. Andy came from home to spend a few weeks at the seaside,
and stopped at the same hotel that I did. He went off yesterday
afternoon, and I haven't seen him since, though he promised to go for a
ride with me. He must have come over here and entered your shop
unobserved. I remember now he asked me where the submarine was being
built that was going to compete with our firm's, and I told him. I
didn't think he was that kind of a lad. Well, since he's probably gone
back home, perhaps you will come for a ride with me, Tom."

"I'm afraid I can't go, thank you," answered the lad. "We are very busy
getting our submarine in shape for a trial.  But I can imagine why Andy
left so hurriedly. He probably learned that a doctor had been summoned
for me, though, as it happened, I didn't need one. But Andy probably
got frightened at what he had done, and left. I'll make him more sorry,
when I meet him."

"Don't blame you a bit," commented Mr. Berg. "Well, I must be getting
back."

He hastened out to his auto, while Tom and his father watched the agent.

"Tom, never trust that man," advised the aged inventor solemnly.

"Just what I was about to remark," said his son. "Well, let's get back
to work. Queer that he should come here again, and it's queer about
Andy Foger."

Father and son returned to the machine shop, while Mr. Berg puffed away
in his auto. A little later, Tom having occasion to go to a building
near the boundary line of the cottage property which his father had
hired for the season, saw, through the hedge that bordered it, an
automobile standing in the road. A second glance showed him that it was
Mr. Berg's machine. Something had gone wrong with it, and the agent had
alighted to make an adjustment.

The young inventor was close to the man, though the latter was unaware
of his presence.

"Hang it all!" Tom heard Mr. Berg exclaim to himself. "I wonder what
they can be up to? They won't enter the Government contests, and they
won't say why. I believe they're up to some game, and I've got to find
out what it is. I wonder if I couldn't use this Foger chap?"

"He seems to have it in for this Tom Swift," Mr. Berg went on, still
talking to himself, though not so low but that Tom could hear him. "I
think I'll try it. I'll get Andy Foger to sneak around and find out
what the game is. He'll do it, I know."

By this time the auto was in working order again, and the agent took
his seat and started off.

"So that's how matters lie, eh?" thought Tom. "Well, Mr. Berg, we'll be
doubly on the lookout for you after this. As for Andy Foger, I think
I'll make him wish he'd never locked me in that tank. So you expect to
find out our 'game,' eh, Mr. Berg? Well, when you do know it, I think
it will astonish you. I only hope you don't learn what it is until we
get at that sunken treasure, though."

But alas for Tom's hopes. Mr. Berg did learn of the object of the
treasure-seekers, and sought to defeat them, as we shall learn as our
story proceeds.




Chapter Six

Turning the Tables


When the young inventor informed his father what he had overheard Mr.
Berg saying, the aged inventor was not as much worried as his son
anticipated.

"All we'll have to do, Tom," he said, "is to keep quiet about where we
are going. Once we have the Advance afloat, and try her out, we can
start on our voyage for the South American Coast and search for the
sunken treasure. When we begin our voyage under water I defy any one to
tell where we are going, or what our plans are. No, I don't believe we
need worry about Mr. Berg, though he probably means mischief."

"Well, I'm going to keep my eyes open for him and Andy Foger," declared
Tom.

The days that followed were filled with work. Not only were there many
unexpected things to do about the submarine, but Mr. Sharp was kept
busy making inquiries about the sunken treasure ship. These inquiries
had to be made carefully, as the adventurers did not want their plans
talked of, and nothing circulates more quickly than rumors of an
expedition after treasure of any kind.

"What about the old sea captain you were going to get to go with us?"
asked Mr. Swift of the balloonist one afternoon.  "Have you succeeded
in finding one yet?"

"Yes; I am in communication with a man I think will be just the person
for us. His name is Captain Alden Weston, and he has sailed all over
the world. He has also taken part in more than one revolution, and, in
fact, is a soldier of fortune. I do not know him personally, but a
friend of mine knows him, and says he will serve us faithfully. I have
written to him, and he will be here in a few days."

"That's good. Now about the location of the wreck itself.  Have you
been able to learn any more details?"

"Well, not many. You see, the Boldero was abandoned in a storm, and the
captain did not take very careful observations. As nearly as it can be
figured out the treasure ship went to the bottom in latitude forty-five
degrees south, and longitude twenty-seven east from Washington. That's
a pretty indefinite location, but I hope, once we get off the Uruguay
coast, we can better it. We can anchor or lay outside the harbor, and
in the small boat we carry go ashore and possibly gain more details.
For it was at Montevideo that the shipwrecked passengers and sailors
landed."

"Does Captain Weston know our object?" inquired Tom.

"No, and I don't propose to tell him until we are ready to start,"
replied Mr. Sharp. "I don't know just how he'll consider a submarine
trip after treasure, but if I spring it on him suddenly he's less
likely to back out. Oh, I think he'll go."

Somewhat unexpectedly the next day it was discovered that certain tools
and appliances were needed for the submarine, and they had been left in
the house at Shopton, where Eradicate Sampson was in charge as
caretaker during the absence of Mr. Swift and his son and the
housekeeper.

"Well, I suppose we'll have to go back after them," remarked Tom.
"We'll take the airship, dad, and make a two-days' trip of it. Is there
anything else you want?"

"Well, you might bring a bundle of papers you'll find in the lower
right hand drawer of my desk. They contain some memoranda I need."

Tom and Mr. Sharp had become so used to traveling in the airship that
it seemed no novelty to them, though they attracted much attention
wherever they went. They soon had the Red Cloud in readiness for a
flight, and rising in the air above the shop that contained the
powerful submarine, a craft utterly different in type from the
aeroplane, the nose of the airship was pointed toward Shopton.

They made a good flight and landed near the big shed where the bird of
the air was kept. It was early evening when they got to the Swift
homestead, and Eradicate Sampson was glad to see them.

Eradicate was a good cook, and soon had a meal ready for the travelers.
Then, while Mr. Sharp selected the tools and other things needed, and
put them in the airship ready for the start back the next morning, Tom
concluded he would take a stroll into Shopton, to see if he could see
his friend, Ned Newton. It was early evening, and the close of a
beautiful day, a sharp shower in the morning having cooled the air.

Tom was greeted by a number of acquaintances as he strolled along, for,
since the episode of the bank robbery, when he had so unexpectedly
returned with the thieves and the cash, the lad was better known than
ever.

"I guess Ned must be home," thought our hero as he looked in vain for
his chum among the throng on the streets. "I've got time to take a
stroll down to his house."

Tom was about to cross the street when he was startled by the sound of
an automobile horn loudly blown just at his side. Then a voice called:

"Hey, there! Git out of the way if you don't want to be run over!"

He looked up, and saw a car careening along. At the wheel was the
red-haired bully, Andy Foger, and in the tonneau were Sam Snedecker and
Pete Bailey.

"Git out of the way," added Sam, and he grinned maliciously at Tom.

The latter stepped back, well out of the path of the car, which was not
moving very fast. Just in front of Tom was a puddle of muddy water.
There was no necessity for Andy steering into it, but he saw his
opportunity, and a moment later one of the big pneumatic tires had
plunged into the dirty fluid, spattering it all over Tom, some even
going as high as his face.

"Ha! ha!" laughed Andy. "Maybe you'll get out of my way next time, Tom
Swift."

The young inventor was almost speechless from righteous anger. He wiped
the mud from his face, glanced down at his clothes, which were all but
ruined, and called out:

"Hold on there, Andy Foger! I want to see you!" for he thought of the
time when Andy had shut him in the tank.

"Ta! ta!" shouted Pete Bailey.

"See you later," added Sam.

"Better go home and take a bath, and then sail away in your submarine,"
went on Andy. "I'll bet it will sink."

Before Tom could reply the auto had turned a corner.  Disgusted and
angry, he tried to sop up some of the muddy water with his
handkerchief. While thus engaged he heard his name called, and looked
up to see Ned Newton.

"What's the matter? Fall down?" asked his chum.

"Andy Foger," replied Tom.

"That's enough," retorted Ned. "I can guess the rest.  We'll have to
tar and feather him some day, and ride him out of town on a rail. I'd
kick him myself, only his father is a director in the bank where I
work, and I'd be fired if I did. Can't afford any such pleasure. But
some day I'll give Andy a good trouncing, and then resign before they
can discharge me. But I'll be looking for another job before I do that.
Come on to my house, Tom, and I'll help you clean up."

Tom was a little more presentable when he left his chum's residence,
after spending the evening there, but he was still burning for revenge
against Andy and his cronies. He had half a notion to go to Andy's
house and tell Mr. Foger how nearly serious the bully's prank at the
submarine had been, but he concluded that Mr. Foger could only uphold
his son. "No, I'll settle with him myself," decided Tom.

Bidding Eradicate keep a watchful eye about the house, and leaving word
for Mr. Damon to be sure to come to the coast if he again called at the
Shopton house, Tom and Mr. Sharp prepared to make their return trip
early the next morning.

The gas tank was filled and the Red Cloud arose in the air. Then, with
the propellers moving at moderate speed, the nose of the craft was
pointed toward the New Jersey coast.

A few miles out from Shopton, finding there was a contrary wind in the
upper regions where they were traveling, Mr. Sharp descended several
hundred feet. They were moving over a sparsely settled part of the
country, and looking down, Tom saw, speeding along a highway, an
automobile.

"I wonder who's in it?" he remarked, taking down a telescope and
peering over the window ledge of the cabin.  The next moment he uttered
a startled exclamation.

"Andy  Foger, Sam  Snedecker and Pete Bailey!" he cried.  "Oh, I wish I
had a bucket of water to empty on them."

"I know a better way to get even with them than that," said Mr. Sharp.

"How?" asked Tom eagerly.

"I'll show you," replied the balloonist. "It's a trick I once played on
a fellow who did me an injury. Here, you steer for a minute until I get
the thing fixed, then I'll take charge."

Mr. Sharp went to the storeroom and came back with a long, stout rope
and a small anchor of four prongs. It was carried to be used in
emergencies, but so far had never been called into requisition.
Fastening the grapple to the cable, the balloonist said:

"Now, Tom, they haven't seen you. You stand in the stern and pay out
the rope. I'll steer the airship, and what I want you to do is to catch
the anchor in the rear of their car. Then I'll show you some fun."

Tom followed instructions. Slowly he lowered the rope with the dangling
grapple. The airship was also sent down, as the cable was not quite
long enough to reach the earth from the height at which they were. The
engine was run at slow speed, so that the noise would not attract the
attention of the three cronies who were speeding along, all unconscious
of the craft in the air over their heads. The Red Cloud was moving in
the same direction as was the automobile.

The anchor was now close to the rear of Andy's car.  Suddenly it caught
on the tonneau and Tom called that fact to Mr. Sharp.

"Fasten the rope at the cleat," directed the balloonist.

Tom did so, and a moment later the aeronaut sent the airship up by
turning more gas into the container. At the same time he reversed the
engine and the Red Cloud began pulling the touring car backward, also
lifting the rear wheels clear from the earth.

A startled cry from the occupants of the machine told Tom and his
friend that Andy and his cronies were aware something was wrong. A
moment later Andy, looking up, saw the airship hovering in the air
above him. Then he saw the rope fast to his auto. The airship was not
rising now, or the auto would have been turned over, but it was slowly
pulling it backward, in spite of the fact that the motor of the car was
still going.

"Here! You let go of me!" cried Andy. "I'll have you arrested if you
damage my car."

"Come up here and cut the rope," called Tom leaning over and looking
down. He could enjoy the bully's discomfiture.  As for Sam and Pete,
they were much frightened, and cowered down on the floor of the tonneau.

"Maybe you'll shut me in the tank again and splash mud on me!" shouted
Tom.

The rear wheels of the auto were lifted still higher from the ground,
as Mr. Sharp turned on a little more gas. Andy was not proof against
this.

"Oh! oh!" he cried. "Please let me down, Tom. I'm awful sorry for what
I did! I'll never do it again! Please, please let me down! Don't! You'll
tip me over!"

He had shut off his motor now, and was frantically clinging to the
steering wheel.

"Do you admit that you're a sneak and a coward?" asked Tom, "rubbing it
in."

"Yes, yes!  Oh, please let me down!"

"Shall we?" asked Tom of Mr. Sharp.

"Yes," replied the balloonist. "We can afford to lose the rope and
anchor for the sake of turning the tables. Cut the cable."

Tom saw what was intended. Using a little hatchet, he severed the rope
with a single blow. With a crash that could be heard up in the air
where the Red Cloud hovered, the rear wheels of the auto dropped to the
ground. Then came two loud reports.

"Both tires busted!" commented Mr. Sharp dryly, and Tom, looking down,
saw the trio of lads ruefully contemplating the collapsed rubber of the
rear wheels. The tables had been effectually turned on Andy Foger. His
auto was disabled, and the airship, with a graceful sweep, mounted
higher and higher, continuing on its way to the coast.




Chapter Seven

Mr. Damon Will Go


"Well, I guess they've had their lesson," remarked Tom, as he took an
observation through the telescope and saw Andy and his cronies hard at
work trying to repair the ruptured tires. "That certainly was a corking
good trick."

"Yes," admitted Mr. Sharp modestly. "I once did something similar, only
it was a horse and wagon instead of an auto.  But let's try for another
speed record. The conditions are just right."

They arrived at the coast much sooner than they had dared to hope, the
Red Cloud proving herself a veritable wonder.

The remainder of that day, and part of the next, was spent in working
on the submarine.

"We'll launch her day after to-morrow," declared Mr. Swift
enthusiastically. "Then to see whether my calculations are right or
wrong."

"It won't be your fault if it doesn't work," said his son.  "You
certainly have done your best."

"And so have you and Mr. Sharp and the others, for that matter. Well, I
have no doubt but that everything will be all right, Tom."

"There!" exclaimed Mr. Sharp the next morning, as he was adjusting a
certain gage. "I knew I'd forget something. That special brand of
lubricating oil. I meant to bring it from Shopton, and I didn't."

"Maybe I can get it in Atlantis," suggested Tom, naming the coast city
nearest to them. "I'll take a walk over. It isn't far."

"Will you? I'll be glad to have you," resumed the balloonist. "A gallon
will be all we'll need."

Tom was soon on his way. He had to walk, as the roads were too poor to
permit him to use the motor-cycle, and the airship attracted too much
attention to use on a short trip.  He was strolling along, when from
the other side of a row of sand dunes, that lined the uncertain road to
Atlantis, he heard some one speaking. At first the tones were not
distinct, but as the lad drew nearer to the voice he heard an
exclamation.

"Bless my gold-headed cane! I believe I'm lost. He said it was out this
way somewhere, but I don't see anything of it.  If I had that Eradicate
Sampson here now I'd--bless my shoelaces I don't know what I would do
to him."

"Mr. Damon! Mr. Damon!" cried Tom. "Is that you?"

"Me? Of course it's me! Who else would it be?" answered the voice. "But
who are you. Why, bless my liver! If it isn't Tom Swift!" he cried.
"Oh, but I'm glad to see you! I was afraid I was shipwrecked! Bless my
gaiters, how are you, anyhow? How is your father? How is Mr. Sharp, and
all the rest of them?"

"Pretty well. And you?"

"Me? Oh, I'm all right; only a trifle nervous. I called at your house
in Shopton yesterday, and Eradicate told me, as well as he could, where
you were located. I had nothing to do, so I thought I'd take a run down
here. But what's this I hear about you? Are you going on a voyage?"

"Yes."

"In the air? May I go along again? I certainly enjoyed my other trip in
the Red Cloud. That is, all but the fire and being shot at. May I go?"

"We're going on a different sort of trip this time," said the youth.

"Where?"

"Under water."

"Under water?  Bless my sponge bath! You don't mean it!"

"Yes. Dad has completed the submarine he was working on when we were
off in the airship, and it will be launched the day after to-morrow."

"Oh, that's so. I'd forgotten about it. He's going to try for the
Government prize, isn't he? But tell me more about it. Bless my
scarf-pin, but I'm glad I met you! Going into town, I take it. Well, I
just came from there, but I'll walk back with you. Do you think--is
there any possibility--that I could go with you? Of course, I don't
want to crowd you, but--"

"Oh, there'll be plenty of room," replied the young inventor. "In fact,
more room than we had in the airship. We were talking only the other
day about the possibility of you going with us, but we didn't think
you'd risk it."

"Risk it? Bless my liver! Of course I'll risk it! It can't be as bad
as sailing in the air. You can't fall, that's certain."

"No; but maybe you can't rise," remarked Tom grimly.

"Oh, we won't think of that. Of course, I'd like to go. I fully
expected to be killed in the Red Cloud, but as I wasn't. I'm ready to
take a chance in the water. On the whole, I think I prefer to be buried
at sea, anyhow. Now, then, will you take me?"

"I think I can safely promise," answered Tom with a smile at his
friend's enthusiasm.

The two were approaching the city, having walked along as they talked.
There were still some sand dunes near the road, and they kept on the
side of these, nearest the beach, where they could watch the breakers.

"But you haven't told me where you are going," went on Mr. Damon, after
blessing a few dozen objects. "Where do the Government trials take
place?"

"Well," replied the lad, "to be frank with you, we have abandoned our
intention of trying for the Government prize."

"Not going to try for it? Bless my slippers! Why not?  Isn't fifty
thousand dollars worth striving for? And, with the kind of a submarine
you say you have, you ought to be able to win."

"Yes, probably we could win," admitted the young inventor, "but we are
going to try for a better prize."

"A better one? I don't understand."

"Sunken treasure," explained Tom. "There's a ship sunk off the coast of
Uruguay, with three hundred thousand dollars in gold bullion aboard.
Dad and I are going to try to recover that in our submarine. We're
going to start day after to-morrow, and, if you like, you may go along."

"Go along! Of course I'll go along!" cried the eccentric man. "But I
never heard of such a thing. Sunken treasure!  Three hundred thousand
dollars in gold! My, what a lot of money! And to go after it in a
submarine! It's as good as a story!"

"Yes, we hope to recover all the treasure," said the lad.  "We ought to
be able to claim at least half of it."

"Bless my pocketbook!" cried Mr. Damon, but Tom did not hear him. At
that instant his attention was attracted by seeing two men emerge from
behind the sand dune near which he and Mr. Damon had halted
momentarily, when the youth explained about the treasure. The man
looked sharply at Tom.  A moment later the first man was joined by
another, and at the sight of him our hero could not repress an
exclamation of alarm. For the second man was none other than Addison
Berg.

The latter glanced quickly at Tom, and then, with a hasty word to his
companion, the two swung around and made off in the opposite direction
to that in which they had been walking.

"What's the matter?" asked Mr. Damon, seeing the young inventor was
strangely affected.

"That--that man," stammered the lad.

"You don't mean to tell me that was one the Happy Harry gang, do you?"

"No. But one, or both of those men, may prove to be worse.  That second
man was Addison Berg, and he's agent for a firm of submarine boat
builders who are rivals of dad's. Berg has been trying to find out why
we abandoned our intention of competing for the Government prize."

"I hope you didn't tell him."

"I didn't intend to," replied Tom, smiling grimly, "but I'm afraid I
have, however. He certainly overheard what I said. I spoke too loud.
Yes, he must have heard me. That's why he hurried off so."

"Possibly no harm is done. You didn't give the location of the sunken
ship."

"No; but I guess from what I said it will be easy enough to find. Well,
if we're going to have a fight for the possession of that sunken gold,
I'm ready for it. The Advance is well equipped for a battle. I must
tell dad of this. It's my fault."

"And partly mine, for asking you such leading questions in a public
place," declared Mr. Damon. "Bless my coat-tails, but I'm sorry! Maybe,
after all, those men were so interested in what they themselves were
saying that they didn't understand what you said."

But if there had been any doubts on this score they would have been
dissolved had Tom and his friend been able to see the actions of Mr.
Berg and his companion a little later.  The plans of the
treasure-hunters had been revealed to their ears.




Chapter Eight

Another Treasure Expedition


While Tom and Mr. Damon continued on to Atlantis after the oil, the
young inventor lamenting from time to time that his remarks about the
real destination of the Advance had been overheard by Mr. Berg, the
latter and his companion were hastening back along the path that ran on
one side of the sand dunes.

"What's your hurry?" asked Mr. Maxwell, who was with the submarine
agent. "You turned around as if you were shot when you saw that man and
the lad. There didn't appear to be any cause for such a hurry. From
what I could hear they were talking about a submarine. You're in the
same business. You might be friends."

"Yes, we might," admitted Mr. Berg with a peculiar smile; "but, unless
I'm very much mistaken, we're going to be rivals."

"Rivals? What do you mean?"

"I can't tell you now. Perhaps I may later. But if you don't mind, walk
a little faster, please. I want to get to a long-distance telephone."

"What for?"

"I have just overheard something that I wish to communicate to my
employers, Bentley & Eagert."

"Overheard something? I don't see what it could be, unless that lad--"

"You'll learn in good time," went on the submarine agent.  "But I must
telephone at once."

A little later the two men had reached a trolley line that ran into
Atlantis, and they arrived at the city before Mr. Damon and Tom got
there, as the latter had to go by a circuitous route. Mr. Berg lost no
time in calling up his firm by telephone.

"I have had another talk with Mr. Swift," he reported to Mr. Bentley,
who came to the instrument in Philadelphia.

"Well, what does he say?" was the impatient question. "I can't
understand his not wanting to try for the Government prize. It is
astonishing. You said you were going to discover the reason, Mr Berg,
but you haven't done so."

"I have."

"What is it?"

"Well, the reason Mr. Swift and his son don't care to try for the fifty
thousand dollar prize is that they are after one of three hundred
thousand dollars."

"Three hundred thousand dollars!" cried Mr. Bentley. "What government
is going to offer such a prize as that for submarines, when they are
getting almost as common as airships? We ought to have a try for that
ourselves. What government is it?"

"No government at all. But I think we ought to have a try for it, Mr.
Bentley."

"Explain."

"Well, I have just learned, most accidentally, that the Swifts are
going after sunken treasure--three hundred thousand dollars in gold
bullion."

"Sunken treasure? Where?

"I don't know exactly, but off the coast of Uruguay," and Mr. Berg
rapidly related what he had overheard Tom tell Mr. Damon. Mr. Bentley
was much excited and impatient for more details, but his agent could
not give them to him.

"Well," concluded the senior member of the firm of submarine boat
builders, "if the Swifts are going after treasure, so can we. Come to
Philadelphia at once, Mr. Berg, and we'll talk this matter over. There
is no time to lose.  We can afford to forego the Government prize for
the chance of getting a much larger one. We have as much right to
search for the sunken gold as the Swifts have. Come here at once, and
we will make our plans."

"All right," agreed the agent with a smile as he hung up the receiver.
"I guess," he murmured to himself, "that you won't be so high and
mighty with me after this, Tom Swift.  We'll see who has the best boat,
after all. We'll have a contest and a competition, but not for a
government prize.  It will be for the sunken gold."

It was easy to see that Mr. Berg was much pleased with himself.

Meanwhile, Tom and Mr. Damon had reached Atlantis, and had purchased
the oil. They started back, but Tom took a street leading toward the
center of the place, instead of striking for the beach path, along
which they had come.

"Where are you going?" asked Mr. Damon.

"I want to see if that Andy Foger has come back here," replied the lad,
and he told of having been shut in the tank by the bully.

"I've never properly punished him for that trick," he went on, "though
we did manage to burst his auto tires. I'm curious to know how he knew
enough to turn that gear and shut the tank door. He must have been
loitering near the shop, seen me go in the submarine alone, watched his
chance and sneaked in after me. But I'd like to get a complete
explanation, and if I once got hold of Andy I could make him talk," and
Tom clenched his fist in a manner that augured no good for the
squint-eyed lad. "He was stopping at the same hotel with Mr. Berg, and
he hurried away after the trick he played on me. I next saw him in
Shopton, but I thought perhaps he might have come back here. I'm going
to inquire at the hotel," he added.

Andy's name was not on the register since his hasty flight, however,
and Tom, after inquiring from the clerk and learning that Mr. Berg was
still a guest at the hostelry, rejoined Mr. Damon.

"Bless my hat!" exclaimed that eccentric individual as they started
back to the lonely beach where the submarine was awaiting her advent
into the water. "The more I think of the trip I'm going to take, the
more I like it."

"I hope you will," remarked Tom. "It will be a new experience for all
of us. There's only one thing worrying me, and that is about Mr. Berg
having overheard what I said."

"Oh, don't worry about that. Can't we slip away and leave no trace in
the water?"

"I hope so, but I must tell dad and Mr. Sharp about what happened."

The aged inventor was not a little alarmed at what his son related, but
he agreed with Mr. Damon, whom he heartily welcomed, that little was to
be apprehended from Berg and his employers.

"They know we're after a sunken wreck, but that's all they do know,"
said Tom's father. "We are only waiting for the arrival of Captain
Alden Weston, and then we will go. Even if Bentley & Eagert make a try
for the treasure we'll have the start of them, and this will be a case
of first come, first served. Don't worry, Tom. I'm glad you're going,
Mr Damon. Come, I will show you our submarine."

As father and son, with their guest, were going to the machine shop,
Mr. Sharp met them. He had a letter in his hand.

"Good news!" the balloonist cried. "Captain Weston will be with us
to-morrow. He will arrive at the Beach Hotel in Atlantis, and wants one
of us to meet him there. He has considerable information about the
wreck."

"The Beach Hotel," murmured Tom. "That is where Mr. Berg is stopping. I
hope he doesn't worm any of our secret from Captain Weston," and it was
with a feeling of uneasiness that the young inventor continued after
his father and Mr. Damon to where the submarine was.




Chapter Nine

Captain Weston's Advent


"Bless my water ballast, but that certainly is a fine boat!" cried Mr.
Damon, when he had been shown over the new craft.  "I think I shall
feel even safer in that than in the Red Cloud."

"Oh, don't go back on the airship!" exclaimed Mr Sharp. "I was counting
on taking you on another trip."

"Well, maybe after we get back from under the ocean," agreed Mr. Damon.
"I particularly like the cabin arrangements of the Advance. I think I
shall enjoy myself."

He would be hard to please who could not take pleasure from a trip in
the submarine. The cabin was particularly fine, and the sleeping
arrangements were good.

More supplies could be carried than was possible on the airship, and
there was more room in which to cook and serve food. Mr. Damon was fond
of good living, and the kitchen pleased him as much as anything else.

Early the next morning Tom set out for Atlantis, to meet Captain Weston
at the hotel. The young inventor inquired of the clerk whether the
seafaring man had arrived, and was told that he had come the previous
evening.

"Is he in his room?" asked Tom.

"No," answered the clerk with a peculiar grin. "He's an odd character.
Wouldn't go to bed last night until we had every window in his room
open, though it was blowing quite hard, and likely to storm. The
captain said he was used to plenty of fresh air. Well, I guess he got
it, all right."

"Where is he now?" asked the youth, wondering what sort of an
individual he was to meet.

"Oh, he was up before sunrise, so some of the scrubwomen told me. They
met him coming from his room, and he went right down to the beach with
a big telescope he always carries with him. He hasn't come back yet.
Probably he's down on the sand."

"Hasn't he had breakfast?"

"No. He left word he didn't want to eat until about four bells,
whatever time that is."

"It's ten o'clock," replied Tom, who had been studying up on sea terms
lately. "Eight bells is eight o'clock in the morning, or four in the
afternoon or eight at night, according to the time of day. Then there's
one bell for every half hour, so four bells this morning would be ten
o'clock in this watch, I suppose."

"Oh, that's the way it goes, eh?" asked the clerk. "I never could get
it through my head. What is twelve o'clock noon?"

"That's eight bells, too; so is twelve o'clock midnight.  Eight bells
is as high as they go on a ship. But I guess I'll go down and see if I
can meet the captain. It will soon be ten o'clock, or four bells, and
he must be hungry for breakfast. By the way, is that Mr. Berg still
here?"

"No; he went away early this morning. He and Captain Weston seemed to
strike up quite an acquaintance, the night clerk told me. They sat and
smoked together until long after midnight, or eight bells," and the
clerk smiled as he glanced down at the big diamond ring on his little
finger.

"They did?" fairly exploded Tom, for he had visions of what the wily
Mr. Berg might worm out of the simple captain.

"Yes. Why, isn't the captain a proper man to make friends with?" and
the clerk looked at Tom curiously.

"Oh, yes, of course," was the hasty answer. "I guess I'll go and see if
I can find him--the captain, I mean."

Tom hardly knew what to think. He wished his father, or Mr. Sharp, had
thought to warn Captain Weston against talking of the wreck. It might
be too late now.

The young inventor hurried to the beach, which was not far from the
hotel. He saw a solitary figure pacing up and down, and from the fact
that the man stopped, every now and then, and gazed seaward through a
large telescope, the lad concluded it was the captain for whom he was
in search. He approached, his footsteps making no sound on the sand.
The man was still gazing through the glass.

"Captain Weston?" spoke Tom.

Without a show of haste, though the voice must have startled him, the
captain turned. Slowly he lowered the telescope, and then he replied
softly:

"That's my name. Who are you, if I may ask?"

Tom was struck, more than by anything else, by the gentle voice of the
seaman. He had prepared himself, from the description of Mr. Sharp, to
meet a gruff, bewhiskered individual, with a voice like a crosscut saw,
and a rolling gait. Instead he saw a man of medium size, with a smooth
face, merry blue eyes, and the softest voice and gentlest manner
imaginable. Tom was very much disappointed. He had looked for a regular
sea-dog, and he met a landsman, as he said afterward. But it was not
long before our hero changed his mind regarding Captain Weston.

"I'm Tom Swift," the owner of that name said, "and I have been sent to
show you the way to where our ship is ready to launch." The young
inventor refrained from mentioning submarine, as it was the wish of Mr
Sharp to disclose this feature of the voyage to the sailor himself.

"Ha, I thought as much," resumed the captain quietly.  "It's a fine
day, if I may be permitted to say so," and he seemed to hesitate, as if
there was some doubt whether or not he might make that observation.

"It certainly is," agreed the lad. Then, with a smile he added: "It is
nearly four bells."

"Ha!" exclaimed the captain, also smiling, but even his manner of
saying "Ha!" was less demonstrative than that of most persons. "I
believe I am getting hungry, if I may be allowed the remark," and again
he seemed asking Tom's pardon for mentioning the fact.

"Perhaps you will come back to the cabin and have a little breakfast
with me," he went on. "I don't know what sort of a galley or cook they
have aboard the Beach Hotel, but it can't be much worse than some I've
tackled."

"No, thank you," answered the youth. "I've had my breakfast. But I'll
wait for you, and then I'd like to get back. Dad and Mr. Sharp are
anxious to meet you."

"And I am anxious to meet them, if you don't mind me mentioning it,"
was the reply, as the captain once more put the spyglass to his eye and
took an observation. "Not many sails in sight this morning," he added.
"But the weather is fine, and we ought to get off in good shape to hunt
for the treasure about which Mr. Sharp wrote me. I believe we are going
after treasure," he said; "that is, if you don't mind talking about it."

"Not in the least," replied Tom quickly, thinking this a good
opportunity for broaching a subject that was worrying him. "Did you
meet a Mr. Berg here last night, Captain Weston?" he went on.

"Yes. Mr. Berg and I had quite a talk. He is a well-informed man."

"Did he mention the sunken treasure?" asked the lad, eager to find out
if his suspicions were true.

"Yes, he did, if you'll excuse me putting it so plainly," answered the
seaman, as if Tom might be offended at so direct a reply. But the young
inventor was soon to learn that this was only an odd habit with the
seaman.

"Did he want to know where the wreck of the Boldero was located?"
continued the lad. "That is, did he try to discover if you knew
anything about it?"

"Yes," said Mr. Weston, "he did. He pumped me, if you are acquainted
with that term, and are not offended by it. You see, when I arrived
here I made inquiries as to where your father's place was located. Mr.
Berg overheard me, and introduced himself as agent for a shipbuilding
concern. He was very friendly, and when he said he knew you and your
parent, I thought he was all right."

Tom's heart sank. His worst fears were to be realized, he thought.

"Yes, he and I talked considerable, if I may be permitted to say so,"
went on the captain. "He seemed to know about the wreck of the Boldero,
and that she had three hundred thousand dollars in gold aboard. The
only thing he didn't know was where the wreck was located. He knew it
was off Uruguay somewhere, but just where he couldn't say. So he asked
me if I knew, since he must have concluded that I was going with you on
the gold-hunting expedition."

"And you do know, don't you?" asked Tom eagerly.

"Well, I have it pretty accurately charted out, if you will allow me
that expression," was the calm answer. "I took pains to look it up at
the request of Mr. Sharp."

"And he wanted to worm that information out of you?" inquired the youth
excitedly.

"Yes, I'm afraid he did."

"Did you give him the location?"

"Well," remarked the captain, as he took another observation before
closing up the telescope, "you see, while we were talking, I happened
to drop a copy of a map I'd made, showing the location of the wreck.
Mr. Berg picked it up to hand to me, and he looked at it."

"Oh!" cried Tom. "Then he knows just where the treasure is, and he may
get to it ahead of us. It's too bad."

"Yes," continued the seaman calmly, "Mr. Berg picked up that map, and
he looked very closely at the latitude and longitude I had marked as
the location of the wreck."

"Then he won't have any trouble finding it," murmured our hero.

"Eh? What's that?" asked the captain, "if I may be permitted to request
you to repeat what you said."

"I say he won't have any trouble locating the sunken Boldero," repeated
Tom.

"Oh, but I think he will, if he depends on that map," was the
unexpected reply. "You see," explained Mr. Weston, "I'm not so simple
as I look. I sensed what Mr. Berg was after, the minute he began to
talk to me. So I fixed up a little game on him. The map which I dropped
on purpose, not accidentally, where he would see it, did have the
location of the wreck marked. Only it didn't happen to be the right
location. It was about five hundred miles out of the way, and I rather
guess if Mr. Berg and his friends go there for treasure they'll find
considerable depth of water and quite a lonesome spot. Oh, no, I'm not
as easy as I look, if you don't mind me mentioning that fact; and when
a scoundrel sets out to get the best of me, I generally try to turn the
tables on him. I've seen such men as Mr. Berg before. I'm afraid, I'm
very much afraid, the sight he had of the fake map I made won't do him
much good. Well, I declare, it's past four bells. Let's go to
breakfast, if you don't mind me asking you," and with that the captain
started off up the beach, Tom following, his ideas all a whirl at the
unlooked-for outcome of the interview.

Trial of the Submarine


Tom felt such a relief at hearing of Captain Weston's ruse that his
appetite, sharpened by an early breakfast and the sea air, came to him
with a rush, and he had a second morning meal with the odd sea captain,
who chuckled heartily when he thought of how Mr Berg had been deceived.

"Yes," resumed Captain Weston, over his bacon and eggs, "I sized him up
for a slick article as soon as I laid eyes on him. But he evidently
misjudged me, if I may be permitted that term. Oh, well, we may meet
again, after we secure the treasure, and then I can show him the real
map of the location of the wreck."

"Then you have it?" inquired the lad eagerly.

Captain Weston nodded, before hiding his face behind a large cup of
coffee; his third, by the way.

"Let me see it?" asked Tom quickly. The captain set down his cup. He
looked carefully about the hotel dining-room.  There were several
guests, who, like himself, were having a late breakfast.

"It's a good plan," the sailor said slowly, "when you're going into
unknown waters, and don't want to leave a wake for the other fellow to
follow, to keep your charts locked up. If it's all the same to you," he
added diffidently, "I'd rather wait until we get to where your father
and Mr. Sharp are before displaying the real map. I've no objection to
showing you the one Mr. Berg saw," and again he chuckled.

The young inventor blushed at his indiscretion. He felt that the news
of the search for the treasure had leaked out through him, though he
was the one to get on the trail of it by seeing the article in the
paper. Now he had nearly been guilty of another break. He realized that
he must be more cautious. The captain saw his confusion, and said:

"I know how it is. You're eager to get under way. I don't blame you. I
was the same myself when I was your age. But we'll soon be at your
place, and then I'll tell you all I know. Sufficient now, to say that I
believe I have located the wreck within a few miles. I got on the track
of a sailor who had met one of the shipwrecked crew of the Boldero, and
he gave me valuable information. Now tell me about the craft we are
going in. A good deal depends on that."

Tom hardly knew what to answer. He recalled what Mr. Sharp had said
about not wanting to tell Captain Weston, until the last moment, that
they were going in a submarine, for fear the old seaman (for he was old
in point of service though not in years) might not care to risk an
under-water trip. Therefore Tom hesitated. Seeing it, Captain Weston
remarked quietly:

"I mean, what type is your submarine? Does it go by compressed air, or
water power?"

"How do you know it's a submarine?" asked the young inventor quickly,
and in some confusion.

"Easy enough. When Mr. Berg thought he was pumping me, I was getting a
lot of information from him. He told me about the submarine his firm
was building, and, naturally, he mentioned yours. One thing led to
another until I got a pretty good idea of your craft. What do you call
it?"

"The Advance."

"Good name. I like it, if you don't mind speaking of it."

"We were afraid you wouldn't like it," commented Tom.

"What, the name?"

"No, the idea of going in a submarine."

"Oh," and Captain Weston laughed. "Well, it takes more than that to
frighten me, if you'll excuse the expression.  I've always had a
hankering to go under the surface, after so many years spent on top.
Once or twice I came near going under, whether I wanted to or not, in
wrecks, but I think I prefer your way. Now, if you're all done, and
don't mind me speaking of it, I think we'll start for your place. We
must hustle, for Berg may yet get on our trail, even if he has got the
wrong route," and he laughed again.

It was no small relief to Mr Swift and Mr. Sharp to learn that Captain
Weston had no objections to a submarine, as they feared he might have.
The captain, in his diffident manner, made friends at once with the
treasure-hunters, and he and Mr. Damon struck up quite an acquaintance.
Tom told of his meeting with the seaman, and the latter related, with
much gusto, the story of how he had fooled Mr. Berg.

"Well, perhaps you'd like to come and take a look at the craft that is
to be our home while we're beneath the water," suggested Mr. Swift and
the sailor assenting, the aged inventor, with much pride, assisted by
Tom, pointed out on the Advance the features of interest. Captain
Weston gave hearty approval, making one or two minor suggestions, which
were carried out.

"And so you launch her to-morrow," he concluded, when he had completed
the inspection "Well, I hope it's a success, if I may be permitted to
say so."

There were busy times around the machine shop next day. So much secrecy
had been maintained that none of the residents, or visitors to the
coast resort, were aware that in their midst was such a wonderful craft
as the submarine. The last touches were put on the under-water ship;
the ways, leading from the shop to the creek, were well greased, and
all was in readiness for the launching. The tide would soon be at
flood, and then the boat would slide down the timbers (at least, that
was the hope of all), and would float in the element meant to receive
her. It was decided that no one should be aboard when the launching
took place, as there was an element of risk attached, since it was not
known just how buoyant the craft was. It was expected she would float,
until the filled tanks took her to the bottom, but there was no telling.

"It will be flood tide now in ten minutes," remarked Captain Weston
quietly, looking at his watch. Then he took an observation through the
telescope. "No hostile ships hanging in the offing," he reported. "All
is favorable, if you don't mind me saying so," and he seemed afraid
lest his remark might give offense.

"Get ready," ordered Mr. Swift. "Tom, see that the ropes are all
clear," for it had been decided to ease the Advance down into the water
by means of strong cables and windlasses, as the creek was so narrow
that the submarine, if launched in the usual way, would poke her nose
into the opposite mud bank and stick there.

"All clear," reported the young inventor.

"High tide!" exclaimed the captain a moment later, snapping shut his
watch.

"Let go!" ordered Mr. Swift, and the various windlasses manned by the
inventor, Tom and the others began to unwind their ropes. Slowly the
ship slid along the greased ways.  Slowly she approached the water. How
anxiously they all watched her! Nearer and nearer her blunt nose, with
the electric propulsion plate and the auxiliary propeller, came to the
creek, the waters of which were quiet now, awaiting the turn of the
tide.

Now little waves lapped the steel sides. It was the first contact of
the Advance with her native element.

"Pay out the rope faster!" cried Mr. Swift.

The windlasses were turned more quickly. Foot by foot the craft slid
along until, with a final rush, the stern left the ways and the
submarine was afloat. Now would come the test. Would she ride on an
even keel, or sink out of sight, or turn turtle? They all ran to the
water's edge, Tom in the lead.

"Hurrah!" suddenly yelled the lad, trying to stand on his head. "She
floats! She's a success! Come on! Let's get aboard!"

For, true enough, the Advance was riding like a duck on the water. She
had been proportioned just right, and her lines were perfect. She rode
as majestically as did any ship destined to sail on the surface, and
not intended to do double duty.

"Come on, we must moor her to the pier," directed Mr. Sharp. "The tide
will turn in a few minutes and take her out to sea."

He and Tom entered a small boat, and soon the submarine was tied to a
small dock that had been built for the purpose.

"Now to try the engine," suggested Mr. Swift, who was almost trembling
with eagerness; for the completion of the ship meant much to him.

"One moment," begged Captain Weston. "If you don't mind, I'll take an
observation," he went on, and he swept the horizon with his telescope.
"All clear," he reported. "I think we may go aboard and make a trial
trip."

Little time was lost in entering the cabin and engine-room, Garret
Jackson accompanying the party to aid with the machinery. It did not
take long to start the motors, dynamos and the big gasolene engine that
was the vital part of the craft. A little water was admitted to the
tanks for ballast, since the food and other supplies were not yet on
board. The Advance now floated with the deck aft of the conning tower
showing about two feet above the surface of the creek. Mr. Swift and
Tom entered the pilot house.

"Start the engines," ordered the aged inventor, "and we'll try my new
system of positive and negative electrical propulsion."

There was a hum and whir in the body of the ship beneath the feet of
Tom and his father. Captain Weston stood on the little deck near the
conning tower.

"All ready?" asked the youth through the speaking tube to Mr. Sharp and
Mr. Jackson in the engine-room.

"All ready," came the answer.

Tom threw over the connecting lever, while his father grasped the
steering wheel. The Advance shot forward, moving swiftly along, about
half submerged.

"She goes! She goes!" cried Tom.

"She certainly does, if I may be permitted to say so," was the calm
contribution of Captain Weston. "I congratulate you."

Faster and faster went the new craft. Mr. Swift headed her toward the
open sea, but stopped just before passing out of the creek, as he was
not yet ready to venture into deep water.

"I want to test the auxiliary propellers," he said. After a little
longer trial of the electric propulsion plates, which were found to
work satisfactorily, sending the submarine up and down the creek at a
fast rate, the screws, such as are used on most submarines, were put
into gear.  They did well, but were not equal to the plates, nor was so
much expected of them.

"I am perfectly satisfied," announced Mr. Swift as he once more headed
the boat to sea. "I think, Captain Weston, you had better go below now."

"Why so?"

"Because I am going to completely submerge the craft. Tom, close the
conning tower door. Perhaps you will come in here with us, Captain
Weston, though it will be rather a tight fit."

"Thank you, I will. I want to see how it feels to be in a pilot house
under water."

Tom closed the water-tight door of the conning tower. Word was sent
through the tube to the engine-room that a more severe test of the ship
was about to be made. The craft was now outside the line of breakers
and in the open sea.

"Is everything ready, Tom?" asked his father in a quiet voice.

"Everything," replied the lad nervously, for the anticipation of being
about to sink below the surface was telling on them all, even on the
calm, old sea captain.

"Then open the tanks and admit the water," ordered Mr. Swift.

His son turned a valve and adjusted some levers. There was a hissing
sound, and the Advance began sinking. She was about to dive beneath the
surface of the ocean, and those aboard her were destined to go through
a terrible experience before she rose again.




Chapter Eleven

On the Ocean Bed


Lower and lower sank the submarine. There was a swirling and foaming of
the water as she went down, caused by the air bubbles which the craft
carried with her in her descent.  Only the top of the conning tower was
out of water now, the ocean having closed over the deck and the rounded
back of the boat. Had any one been watching they would have imagined
that an accident was taking place.

In the pilot house, with its thick glass windows, Tom, his father and
Captain Weston looked over the surface of the ocean, which every minute
was coming nearer and nearer to them.

"We'll be all under in a few seconds," spoke Tom in a solemn voice, as
he listened to the water hissing into the tanks.

"Yes, and then we can see what sort of progress we will make," added
Mr. Swift. "Everything is going fine, though," he went on cheerfully.
"I believe I have a good boat."

"There is no doubt of it in my mind," remarked Captain Weston, and Tom
felt a little disappointed that the sailor did not shout out some such
expression as "Shiver my timbers!" or "Keel-haul the main braces,
there, you lubber!" But Captain Weston was not that kind of a sailor,
though his usually quiet demeanor could be quickly dropped on
necessity, as Tom learned later.

A few minutes more and the waters closed over the top of the conning
tower. The Advance was completely submerged.  Through the thick glass
windows of the pilot house the occupants looked out into the greenish
water that swirled about them; but it could not enter. Then, as the
boat went lower, the light from above gradually died out, and the
semi-darkness gave place to gloom.

"Turn on the electrics and the searchlight, Tom," directed his father.

There was the click of a switch, and the conning tower was flooded with
light. But as this had the effect of preventing the three from peering
out into the water, just as one in a lighted room cannot look out into
the night, Tom shut them off and switched on the great searchlight.
This projected its powerful beams straight ahead and there, under the
ocean, was a pathway of illumination for the treasure-seekers.

"Fine!" cried Captain Weston, with more enthusiasm than he had yet
manifested. "That's great, if you don't mind me mentioning it. How deep
are we?"

Tom glanced at a gage on the side of the pilot tower.

"Only about sixty feet," he answered.

"Then don't go any deeper!" cried the captain hastily. "I know these
waters around here, and that's about all the depth you've got. You'll
be on the bottom in a minute."

"I intend to get on the bottom after a while," said Mr. Swift, "but not
here. I want to try for a greater distance under water before I come to
rest on the ocean's bed. But I think we are deep enough for a test.
Tom, close the tank intake pipes and we'll see how the Advance will
progress when fully submerged."

The hissing stopped, and then, wishing to see how the motors and other
machinery would work, the aged inventor and his son, accompanied by
Captain Weston, descended from the conning tower, by means of an inner
stairway, to the interior of the ship. The submarine could be steered
and managed from below or above. She was now floating about sixty-five
feet below the surface of the bay.

"Well, how do you like it?" asked Tom of Mr. Damon, as he saw his
friend in an easy chair in the living-room or main cabin of the craft,
looking out of one of the plate-glass windows on the side.

"Bless my spectacles, it's the most wonderful thing I ever dreamed of!"
cried the queer character, as he peered at the mass of water before
him. "To think that I'm away down under the surface, and yet as dry as
a bone. Bless my necktie, but it's great! What are we going to do now?"

"Go forward," replied the young inventor.

"Perhaps I had better make an observation," suggested Captain Weston,
taking his telescope from under his arm, where he had carried it since
entering the craft, and opening it. "We may run afoul of something, if
you don't mind me mentioning such a disagreeable subject." Then, as he
thought of the impossibility of using his glass under water, he closed
it.

"I shall have little use for this here, I'm afraid," he remarked with a
smile. "Well, there's some consolation.  We're not likely to meet many
ships in this part of the ocean. Other vessels are fond enough of
remaining on the surface. I fancy we shall have the depths to
ourselves, unless we meet a Government submarine, and they are hardly
able to go as deep as we can. No, I guess we won't run into anything
and I can put this glass away."

"Unless we run into Berg and his crowd," suggested Tom in a low voice.

"Ha! ha!" laughed Captain Weston, for he did not want Mr. Swift to
worry over the unscrupulous agent. "No, I don't believe we'll meet
them, Tom. I guess Berg is trying to work out the longitude and
latitude I gave him. I wish I could see his face when he realizes that
he's been deceived by that fake map."

"Well, I hope he doesn't discover it too soon and trail us," went on
the lad. "But they're going to start the machinery now. I suppose you
and I had better take charge of the steering of the craft. Dad will
want to be in the engine-room."

"All right," replied the captain, and he moved forward with the lad to
a small compartment, shut off from the living-room, that served as a
pilot house when the conning tower was not used. The same levers,
wheels and valves were there as up above, and the submarine could be
managed as well from there as from the other place.

"Is everything all right?" asked Mr Swift as he went into the
engine-room, where Garret Jackson and Mr. Sharp were busy with oil cans.

"Everything," replied the balloonist. "Are you going to start now?"

"Yes, we're deep enough for a speed trial. We'll go out to sea,
however, and try for a lower depth record, as soon as there's enough
water. Start the engine."

A moment later the powerful electric currents were flowing into the
forward and aft plates, and the Advance began to gather way, forging
through the water.

"Straight ahead, out to sea, Tom," called his father to him.

"Aye, aye, sir," responded the youth.

"Ha! Quite seaman-like, if you don't mind a reference to it," commented
Captain Weston with a smile. "Mind your helm, boy, for you don't want
to poke her nose into a mud bank, or run up on a shoal."

"Suppose you steer?" suggested the lad. "I'd rather take lessons for a
while."

"All right. Perhaps it will be safer. I know these waters from the top,
though I can't say as much for the bottom.  However, I know where the
shoals are."

The powerful searchlight was turned, so as to send its beams along the
path which the submarine was to follow, and then, as she gathered
speed, she shot ahead, gliding through the waters like a fish.

Mr. Damon divided his time between the forward pilot-room, the
living-apartment, and the place where Mr. Swift, Garret Jackson and Mr.
Sharp were working over the engines. Every few minutes he would bless
some part of himself, his clothing, or the ship. Finally the old man
settled down to look through the plate-glass windows in the main
apartment.

On and on went the submarine. She behaved perfectly, and was under
excellent control. Some times Tom, at the request of his father, would
send her toward the surface by means of the deflecting rudder. Then she
would dive to the bottom again. Once, as a test, she was sent obliquely
to the surface, her tower just emerging, and then she darted downward
again, like a porpoise that had come up to roll over, and suddenly
concluded to seek the depths. In fact, had any one seen the maneuver
they would have imagined the craft was a big fish disporting itself.

Captain Weston remained at Tom's side, giving him instructions, and
watching the compass in order to direct the steering so as to avoid
collisions. For an hour or more the craft was sent almost straight
ahead at medium speed.  Then Mr. Swift, joining his son and the
captain, remarked:

"How about depth of water here, Captain Weston?"

"You've got more than a mile."

"Good! Then I'm going down to the bottom of the sea! Tom, fill the
tanks still more.

"Aye, aye, sir," answered the lad gaily. "Now for a new experience!"

"And use the deflecting rudder, also," advised his father.  "That will
hasten matters."

Five minutes later there was a slight jar noticeable.

"Bless my soul! What's that?" cried Mr. Damon. "Have we hit something?"

"Yes," answered Tom with a smile.

"What, for gracious sake?"

"The bottom of the sea. We're on the bed of the ocean."




Chapter Twelve

For a Breath of Air


They could hardly realize it, yet the depth-gage told the story. It
registered a distance below the surface of the ocean of five thousand
seven hundred feet--a little over a mile. The Advance had actually come
to rest on the bottom of the Atlantic.

"Hurrah!" cried Tom. "Let's get on the diving suits, dad, and walk
about on land under water for a change."

"No," said Mr. Swift soberly. "We will hardly have time for that now.
Besides, the suits are not yet fitted with the automatic air-tanks, and
we can't use them. There are still some things to do before we start on
our treasure cruise.  But I want to see how the plates are standing
this pressure."

The Advance was made with a triple hull, the spaces between the layers
of plates being filled with a secret material, capable of withstanding
enormous pressure, as were also the plates themselves. Mr. Swift, aided
by Mr. Jackson and Captain Weston, made a thorough examination, and
found that not a drop of water had leaked in, nor was there the least
sign that any of the plates had given way under the terrific strain.

"She's as tight as a drum, if you will allow me to make that
comparison," remarked Captain Weston modestly. "I couldn't ask for a
dryer ship."

"Well, let's take a look around by means the searchlight and the
observation windows, and then we'll go back," suggested Mr. Swift. "It
will take about two days to get the stores and provisions aboard and
rig up the diving suits; then we will start for the sunken treasure."

There were several powerful searchlights on the Advance, so arranged
that the bow, stern or either side could be illuminated independently.
There were also observation windows near each light.

In turn the powerful rays were cast first at the bow and then aft. In
the gleams could be seen the sandy bed of the ocean, covered with
shells of various kinds. Great crabs walked around on their long,
jointed legs, and Tom saw some lobsters that would have brought joy to
the heart of a fisherman.

"Look at the big fish!" cried Mr. Damon suddenly, and he pointed to
some dark, shadowy forms that swam up to the glass windows, evidently
puzzled by the light.

"Porpoises," declared Captain Weston briefly, "a whole school of them."

The fish seemed suddenly to multiply, and soon those in the submarine
felt curious tremors running through the whole craft.

"The fish are rubbing up against it," cried Tom. "They must think we
came down here to allow them to scratch their backs on the steel
plates."

For some time they remained on the bottom, watching the wonderful sight
of the fishes that swam all about them.

"Well, I think we may as well rise," announced Mr. Swift, after they
had been on the bottom about an hour, moving here and there. "We didn't
bring any provisions, and I'm getting hungry, though I don't know how
the others of you feel about it."

"Bless my dinner-plate, I could eat, too!" cried Mr. Damon. "Go up, by
all means. We'll get enough of under-water travel once we start for the
treasure."

"Send her up, Tom," called his father. "I want to make a few notes on
some needed changes and improvements."

Tom entered the lower pilot house, and turned the valve that opened the
tanks. He also pulled the lever that started the pumps, so that the
water ballast would be more quickly emptied, as that would render the
submarine buoyant, and she would quickly shoot to the surface. To the
surprise of the lad, however, there followed no outrushing of the
water. The Advance remained stationary on the ocean bed. Mr. Swift
looked up from his notes.

"Didn't you hear me ask you to send her up, Tom?" he inquired mildly.

"I did, dad, but something seems to be the matter," was the reply.

"Matter? What do you mean?" and the aged inventor hastened to where his
son and Captain Weston were at the wheels, valves and levers.

"Why, the tanks won't empty, and the pumps don't seem to work."

"Let me try," suggested Mr. Swift, and he pulled the various handles.
There was no corresponding action of the machinery.

"That's odd," he remarked in a curious voice "Perhaps something has
gone wrong with the connections. Go look in the engine-room, and ask
Mr. Sharp if everything is all right there."

Tom made a quick trip, returning to report that the dynamos, motors and
gas engine were running perfectly.

"Try to work the tank levers and pumps from the conning tower,"
suggested Captain Weston. "Sometimes I've known the steam steering gear
to play tricks like that."

Tom hurried up the circular stairway into the tower. He pulled the
levers and shifted the valves and wheels there.  But there was no
emptying of the water tanks. The weight and pressure of water in them
still held the submarine on the bottom of the sea, more than a mile
from the surface. The pumps in the engine-room were working at top
speed, but there was evidently something wrong in the connections.  Mr.
Swift quickly came to this conclusion.

"We must repair it at once," he said. "Tom, come to the engine-room.
You and I, with Mr. Jackson and Mr. Sharp, will soon have it in shape
again."

"Is there any danger?" asked Mr. Damon in a perturbed voice. "Bless my
soul, it's unlucky to have an accident on our trial trip."

"Oh, we must expect accidents," declared Mr. Swift with a smile. "This
is nothing."

But it proved to be more difficult than he had imagined to re-establish
the connection between the pumps and the tanks. The valves, too, had
clogged or jammed, and as the pressure outside the ship was so great,
the water would not run out of itself. It must be forced.

For an hour or more the inventor, his son and the others, worked away.
They could accomplish nothing. Tom looked anxiously at his parent when
the latter paused in his efforts.

"Don't worry," advised the aged inventor. "It's got to come right
sooner or later."

Just then Mr. Damon, who had been wandering about the ship, entered the
engine-room.

"Do you know," he said, "you ought to open a window, or something."

"Why, what's the matter?" asked Tom quickly, looking to see if the odd
man was joking.

"Well, of course I don't exactly mean a window," explained Mr. Damon,
"but we need fresh air."

"Fresh air!" There was a startled note in Mr. Swift's voice as he
repeated the words.

"Yes, I can hardly breathe in the living-room, and it's not much better
here."

"Why, there ought to be plenty of fresh air," went on the inventor. "It
is renewed automatically."

Tom jumped up and looked at an indicator. He uttered a startled cry.

"The air hasn't been changed in the last hour!" he exclaimed. "It is
bad. There's not enough oxygen in it. I notice it, now that I've
stopped working. The gage indicates it, too. The automatic air-changer
must have stopped working. I'll fix it."

He hurried to the machine which was depended on to supply fresh air to
the submarine.

"Why, the air tanks are empty!" the young inventor cried.  "We haven't
any more air except what is in the ship now!"

"And we're rapidly breathing that up," added Captain Weston solemnly.

"Can't you make more?" cried Mr. Damon. "I thought you said you could
make oxygen aboard the ship."

"We can," answered Mr. Swift, "but I did not bring along a supply of
the necessary chemicals. I did not think we would be submerged long
enough for that. But there should have been enough in the reserve tank
to last several days. How about it, Tom?"

"It's all leaked out, or else it wasn't filled," was the despairing
answer. "All the air we have is what's in the ship, and we can't make
more."

The treasure-seekers looked at each other. It was an awful situation.

"Then the only thing to do is to fix the machinery and rise to the
surface," said Mr. Sharp simply. "We can have all the air we want,
then."

"Yes, but the machinery doesn't seem possible of being fixed," spoke
Tom in a low voice.

"We must do it!" cried his father.

They set to work again with fierce energy, laboring for their very
lives. They all knew that they could not long remain in the ship
without oxygen. Nor could they desert it to go to the surface, for the
moment they left the protection of the thick steel sides the terrible
pressure of the water would kill them. Nor were the diving suits
available. They must stay in the craft and die a miserable death--unless
the machinery could be repaired and the Advance sent to the surface.
The emergency expanding lifting tank was not yet in working order.

More frantically they toiled, trying every device that was suggested to
the mechanical minds of Tom, his father, Mr. Sharp or Mr. Jackson, to
make the pumps work. But something was wrong. More and more foul grew
the air. They were fairly gasping now. It was  difficult to breathe, to
say nothing of working, in that atmosphere. The thought of their
terrible position was in the minds of all.

"Oh, for one breath of fresh air!" cried Mr. Damon, who seemed to
suffer more than any of the others. Grim death was hovering around
them, imprisoned as they were on the ocean's bed, over a mile from the
surface.




Chapter Thirteen

Off for the Treasure


Suddenly Tom, after a moment's pause, seized a wrench and began
loosening some nuts.

"What are you doing?" asked his father faintly, for he was being
weakened by the vitiated atmosphere.

"I'm going to take this valve apart," replied his son. "We haven't
looked there for the trouble. Maybe it's out of order."

He attacked the valve with energy, but his hands soon lagged. The lack
of oxygen was telling on him. He could no longer work quickly.

"I'll help," murmured Mr. Sharp thickly. He took a wrench, but no
sooner had he loosened one nut than he toppled over.  "I'm all in," he
murmured feebly.

"Is he dead?" cried Mr. Damon, himself gasping.

"No, only fainted. But he soon will be dead, and so will all of us, if
we don't get fresh air," remarked Captain Weston. "Lie down on the
floor, every one. There is a little fairly good air there. It's heavier
than the air we've breathed, and we can exist on it for a little
longer. Poor Sharp was so used to breathing the rarified air of high
altitudes that he can't stand this heavy atmosphere."

Mr. Damon was gasping worse than ever, and so was Mr. Swift. The
balloonist lay an inert heap on the floor, with Captain Weston trying
to force a few drops of stimulant down his throat.

With a fierce determination in his heart, but with fingers that almost
refused to do his bidding, Tom once more sought to open the big valve.
He felt sure the trouble was located there, as they had tried to locate
it in every other place without avail.

"I'll help," said Mr. Jackson in a whisper. He, too, was hardly able to
move.

More and more devoid of oxygen grew the air. It gave Tom a sense as if
his head was filled, and ready to burst with every breath he drew.
Still he struggled to loosen the nuts.  There were but four more now,
and he took off three while Mr. Jackson removed one. The young inventor
lifted off the valve cover, though it felt like a ton weight to him. He
gave a glance inside.

"Here's the trouble!" he murmured. "The valve's clogged.  No wonder it
wouldn't work. The pumps couldn't force the water out."

It was the work of only a minute to adjust the valve. Then Tom and the
engineer managed to get the cover back on.

How they inserted the bolts and screwed the nuts in place they never
could remember clearly afterward, but they managed it somehow, with
shaking, trembling hands and eyes that grew more and more dim.

"Now start the pumps!" cried Tom faintly. "The tanks will be emptied,
and we can get to the surface."

Mr. Sharp was still unconscious, nor was Mr. Swift able to help. He lay
with his eyes closed. Garret Jackson, however, managed to crawl to the
engine-room, and soon the clank of machinery told Tom that the pumps
were in motion. The lad staggered to the pilot house and threw the
levers over. An instant later there was the hissing of water as it
rushed from the ballast tanks. The submarine shivered, as though
disliking to leave the bottom of the sea, and then slowly rose. As the
pumps worked more rapidly, and the sea was sent from the tank in great
volumes, the boat fairly shot to the surface. Tom was ready to open the
conning tower and let in fresh air as soon as the top was above the
surface.

With a bound the Advance reached the top. Tom frantically worked the
worm gear that opened the tower. In rushed the fresh, life-giving air,
and the treasure-hunters filled their lungs with it.

And it was only just in time, for Mr. Sharp was almost gone. He quickly
revived, as did the others, when they could breathe as much as they
wished of the glorious oxygen.

"That was a close call," commented Mr. Swift. "We'll not go below again
until I have provided for all emergencies. I should have seen to the
air tanks and the expanding one before going below. We'll sail home on
the surface now."

The submarine was put about and headed for her dock. On the way she
passed a small steamer, and the passengers looked down in wonder at the
strange craft.

When the Advance reached the secluded creek where she had been
launched, her passengers had fully recovered from their terrible
experience, though the nerves of Mr. Swift and Mr. Damon were not at
ease for some days thereafter.

"I should never have made a submerged test without making sure that we
had a reserve supply of air," remarked the aged inventor. "I will not
be caught that way again. But I can't understand how the pump valve got
out of order."

"Maybe some one tampered with it," suggested Mr. Damon.  "Could Andy
Foger, any of the Happy Harry gang, or the rival gold-seekers have done
it?"

"I hardly think so," answered Tom. "The place has been too carefully
guarded since Berg and Andy once sneaked in. I think it was just an
accident, but I have thought of a plan whereby such accidents can be
avoided in the future. It needs a simple device."

"Better patent it," suggested Mr. Sharp with a smile.

"Maybe I will," replied the young inventor. "But not now.  We haven't
time, if we intend to get fitted out for our trip."

"No; I should say the sooner we started the better," remarked Captain
Weston. "That is, if you don't mind me speaking about it," he added
gently, and the others smiled, for his diffident comments were only a
matter of habit.

The first act of the adventurers, after tying the submarine at the
dock, was to proceed with the loading of the food and supplies. Tom and
Mr. Damon looked to this, while Mr. Swift and Mr. Sharp made some
necessary changes to the machinery. The next day the young inventor
attached his device to the pump valve, and the loading of the craft was
continued.

All was in readiness for the gold-seeking expedition a week later.
Captain Weston had carefully charted the route they were to follow, and
it was decided to move along on the surface for the first day, so as to
get well out to sea before submerging the craft. Then it would sink
below the surface, and run along under the water until the wreck was
reached, rising at times, as needed, to renew the air supply.

With sufficient stores and provisions aboard to last several months, if
necessary, though they did not expect to be gone more than sixty days
at most, the adventurers arose early one morning and went down to the
dock. Mr. Jackson was not to accompany them. He did not care about a
submarine trip, he said, and Mr. Swift desired him to remain at the
seaside cottage and guard the shops, which contained much valuable
machinery. The airship was also left there.

"Well, are we all ready?" asked Mr. Swift of the little party of
gold-seekers, as they were about to enter the conning tower hatchway of
the submarine.

"All ready, dad," responded his son.

"Then let's get aboard," proposed Captain Weston. "But first let me
take an observation."

He swept the horizon with his telescope, and Tom noticed that the
sailor kept it fixed on one particular spot for some time.

"Did you see anything?" asked the lad.

"Well, there is a boat lying off there," was the answer.  "And some one
is observing us through a glass. But I don't believe it matters.
Probably they're only trying to see what sort of an odd fish we are."

"All aboard, then," ordered Mr. Swift, and they went into the
submarine. Tom and his father, with Captain Weston, remained in the
conning tower. The signal was given, the electricity flowed into the
forward and aft plates, and the Advance shot ahead on the surface.

The sailor raised his telescope once more and peered through a window
in the tower. He uttered an exclamation.

"What's the matter?" asked Tom.

"That other ship--a small steamer--is weighing anchor and seems to be
heading this way," was the reply.

"Maybe it's some one hired by Berg to follow us and trace our
movements," suggested Tom.

"If it is we'll fool them," added his father. "Just keep an eye on
them, captain, and I think we can show them a trick or two in a few
minutes."

Faster shot the Advance through the water. She had started on her way
to get the gold from the sunken wreck, but already enemies were on the
trail of the adventurers, for the ship the sailor had noticed was
steaming after them.




Chapter Fourteen

In the Diving Suits


There was no doubt that the steamer was coming after the submarine.
Several observations Captain Weston made confirmed this, and he
reported the fact to Mr. Swift.

"Well, we'll change our plans, then," said the inventor.  "Instead of
sailing on the surface we'll go below. But first let them get near so
they may have the benefit of seeing what we do. Tom, go below, please,
and tell Mr. Sharp to get every thing in readiness for a quick descent.
We'll slow up a bit now, and let them get nearer to us."

The speed of the submarine was reduced, and in a short time the strange
steamer had overhauled her, coming to within hailing distance.

Mr. Swift signaled for the machinery to stop and the submarine came to
a halt on the surface, bobbing about like a half-submerged bottle. The
inventor opened a bull's-eye in the tower, and called to a man on the
bridge of the steamer:

"What are you following us for?"

"Following you?" repeated the man, for the strange vessel had also come
to a stop. "We're not following you."

"It looks like it," replied Mr. Swift. "You'd better give it up."

"I guess the waters are free," was the quick retort.  "We'll follow you
if we like."

"Will you? Then come on!" cried the inventor as he quickly closed the
heavy glass window and pulled a lever. An instant later the submarine
began to sink, and Mr. Swift could not help laughing as, just before
the tower went under water, he had a glimpse of the astonished face of
the man on the bridge. The latter had evidently not expected such a
move as that.

Lower and lower in the water went the craft, until it was about two
hundred feet below the surface. Then Mr. Swift left the conning tower,
descended to the main part of the ship, and asked Tom and Captain
Weston to take charge of the pilot house.

"Send her ahead, Tom," his father said. "That fellow up above is
rubbing his eyes yet, wondering where we are, I suppose."

Forward shot the Advance under water, the powerful electrical plates
pulling and pushing her on the way to secure the sunken gold.

All that morning a fairly moderate rate of speed was maintained, as it
was thought best not to run the new machinery too fast.

Dinner was eaten about a quarter of a mile below the surface, but no
one inside the submarine would ever have known it. Electric lights made
the place as brilliant as could be desired, and the food, which Tom and
Mr. Damon prepared, was equal to any that could have been served on
land. After the meal they opened the shutters over the windows in the
sides of the craft, and looked at the myriads of fishes swimming past,
as the creatures were disclosed in the glare of the searchlight.

That night they were several hundred miles on their journey, for the
craft was speedy, and leaving Tom and Captain Weston to take the first
watch, the others went to bed.

"Bless my soul, but it does seem odd, though, to go to bed under water,
like a fish," remarked Mr. Damon. "If my wife knew this she would worry
to death. She thinks I'm off automobiling. But this isn't half as
dangerous as riding in a car that's always getting out of order. A
submarine for mine, every time."

"Wait until we get to the end of this trip," advised Tom.  "I guess
you'll find almost as many things can happen in a submarine as can in
an auto," and future events were to prove the young inventor to be
right.

Everything worked well that night, and the ship made good progress.
They rose to the surface the next morning to make sure of their
position, and to get fresh air, though they did not really need the
latter, as the reserve supply had not been drawn on, and was sufficient
for several days, now that the oxygen machine had been put in running
order.

On the second day the ship was sent to the bottom and halted there, as
Mr. Swift wished to try the new diving suits. These were made of a new,
light, but very strong metal to withstand the pressure of a great depth.

Tom, Mr. Sharp and Captain Weston donned the suits, the others agreeing
to wait until they saw how the first trial resulted. Then, too, it was
necessary for some one acquainted with the machinery to remain in the
ship to operate the door and water chamber through which the divers had
to pass to get out.

The usual plan, with some changes, was followed in letting the three
out of the boat, and on to the bottom of the sea.  They entered a
chamber in the side of the submarine, water was gradually admitted
until it equaled in pressure that outside, then an outer door was
opened by means of levers, and they could step out.

It was a curious sensation to Tom and the others to feel that they were
actually walking along the bed of the ocean.  All around them was the
water, and as they turned on the small electric lights in their
helmets, which lights were fed by storage batteries fastened to the
diving suits, they saw the fish, big and little, swarm up to them,
doubtless astonished at the odd creatures which had entered their
domain. On the sand of the bottom, and in and out among the shells and
rocks, crawled great spider crabs, big eels and other odd creatures
seldom seen on the surface of the water.  The three divers found no
difficulty in breathing, as there were air tanks fastened to their
shoulders, and a constant supply of oxygen was fed through pipes into
the helmets. The pressure of water did not bother them, and after the
first sensation Tom began to enjoy the novelty of it. At first the
inability to speak to his companions seemed odd, but he soon got so he
could make signs and motions, and be understood.

They walked about for some time, and once the lad came upon a part of a
wrecked vessel buried deep in the sand.  There was no telling what ship
it was, nor how long it had been there, and after silently viewing it,
they continued on.

"It was great!" were the first words Tom uttered when he and the others
were once more inside the submarine and had removed the suits. "If we
can only walk around the wreck of the Boldero that way, we'll have all
the gold out of her in no time. There are no life-lines nor air-hose to
bother with in these diving suits."

"They certainly are a success," conceded Mr. Sharp.

"Bless my topknot!" cried Mr. Damon. "I'll try it next time. I've
always wanted to be a diver, and now I have the chance."

The trip was resumed after the diving chamber had been closed, and on
the third day Captain Weston announced, after a look at his chart, that
they were nearing the Bahama Islands.

"We'll have to be careful not to run into any of the small keys," he
said, that being the name for the many little points of land, hardly
large enough to be dignified by the name of island. "We must keep a
constant lookout."

Fortune favored them, though once, when Tom was steering, he narrowly
avoided ramming a coral reef with the submarine.  The searchlight
showed it to him just in time, and he sheered off with a thumping in
his heart.

The course was changed from south to east, so as to get ready to swing
out of the way of the big shoulder of South America where Brazil takes
up so much room, and as they went farther and farther toward the
equator, they noticed that the waters teemed more and more with fish,
some beautiful, some ugly and fear-inspiring, and some such monsters
that it made one shudder to look at them, even through the thick glass
of the bulls-eye windows.




Chapter Fifteen

At the Tropical Island


It was on the evening of the fourth day later that Captain Weston, who
was steering the craft, suddenly called out:

"Land ho!"

"Where away?" inquired Tom quickly, for he had read that this was the
proper response to make.

"Dead ahead," answered the sailor with a smile. "Shall we make for it,
if I may be allowed the question?"

"What land is it likely to be?" Mr. Swift wanted to know.

"Oh, some small tropical island," replied the seafaring man. "It isn't
down on the charts. Probably it's too small to note. I should say it
was a coral island, but we may be able to find a spring of fresh water
there, and some fruit."

"Then we'll land there," decided the inventor. "We can use some fresh
water, though our distilling and ice apparatus does very well."

They made the island just at dusk, and anchored in a little lagoon,
where there was a good depth of water.

"Now for shore!" cried Tom, as the submarine swung around on the chain.
"It looks like a fine place. I hope there are cocoanuts and oranges
here. Shall I get out the electric launch, dad?"

"Yes, you may, and we'll all go ashore. It will do us good to stretch
our legs a bit."

Carried in a sort of pocket on the deck of the submarine was a small
electric boat, capable of holding six. It could be slid from the
pocket, or depression, into the water without the use of davits, and,
with Mr. Sharp to aid him, Tom soon had the little craft afloat. The
batteries were already charged, and just as the sun was going down the
gold-seekers entered the launch and were soon on shore.

They found a good spring of water close at hand, and Tom's wish
regarding the cocoanuts was realized, though there were no oranges. The
lad took several of the delicious nuts, and breaking them open poured
the milk into a collapsible cup he carried, drinking it eagerly. The
others followed his example, and pronounced it the best beverage they
had tasted in a long time.

The island was a typical tropical one, not very large, and it did not
appear to have been often visited by man. There were no animals to be
seen, but myriads of birds flew here and there amid the trees, the
trailing vines and streamers of moss.

"Let's spend a day here to-morrow and explore it," proposed Tom, and
his father nodded an assent. They went back to the submarine as night
was beginning to gather, and in the cabin, after supper, talked over
the happenings of their trip so far.

"Do you think we'll have any trouble getting the gold out of the
wrecked vessel?" asked Tom of Captain Weston, after a pause.

"Well, it's hard to say. I couldn't learn just how the wreck lays,
whether it's on a sandy or a rocky bottom. If the latter, it won't be
so hard, but if the sand has worked in and partly covered it, we'll
have some difficulties, if I may be permitted to say so. However, don't
borrow trouble.  We're not there yet, though at the rate we're
traveling it won't be long before we arrive."

No watch was set that night, as it was not considered necessary. Tom
was the first to arise in the morning, and he went out on the deck for
a breath of fresh air before breakfast.

He looked off at the beautiful little island, and as his eye took in
all of the little lagoon where the submarine was anchored he uttered a
startled cry.

And well he might, for, not a hundred yards away, and nearer to the
island than was the Advance, floated another craft--another craft,
almost similar in shape and size to the one built by the Swifts. Tom
rubbed his eyes to make sure he was not seeing double. No, there could
be no mistake about it. There was another submarine at the tropical
island.

As he looked, some one emerged from the conning tower of the second
craft. The figure seemed strangely familiar. Tom knew in a moment who
it was--Addison Berg. The agent saw the lad, too, and taking off his
cap and making a mocking bow, he called out:

"Good morning! Have you got the gold yet?"

Tom did not know what to answer. Seeing the other submarine, at an
island where he had supposed they would not be disturbed, was
disconcerting enough, but to be greeted by Berg was altogether too
much, Tom thought. His fears that the rival boat builders would follow
had not been without foundation.

"Rather surprised to see us, aren't you?" went on Mr. Berg, smiling.

"Rather," admitted Tom, choking over the word.

"Thought you'd be," continued Berg. "We didn't expect to meet you so
soon, but we're glad we did. I don't altogether like hunting for sunken
treasure, with such indefinite directions as I have."

"You--are going to--" stammered Tom, and then he concluded it would be
best not to say anything. But his talk had been heard inside the
submarine. His father came to the foot of the conning tower stairway.

"To whom are you speaking, Tom?" he asked.

"They're here, dad," was the youth's answer.

"Here? Who are here?"

"Berg and his employers. They've followed us, dad."




Chapter Sixteen

"We'll Race You For It"


Mr. Swift hurried up on deck. He was accompanied by Captain Weston. At
the sight of Tom's father, Mr. Berg, who had been joined by two other
men, called out:

"You see we also concluded to give up the trial for the Government
prize, Mr. Swift. We decided there was more money in something else.
But we still will have a good chance to try the merits of our
respective boats. We hurried and got ours fitted up almost as soon as
you did yours, and I think we have the better craft."

"I don't care to enter into any competition with you," said Mr. Swift
coldly.

"Ah, but I'm afraid you'll have to, whether you want to or not," was
the insolent reply.

"What's that?  Do you mean to force this matter upon me?"

"I'm afraid I'll have to--my employers and I, that is. You see, we
managed to pick up your trail after you left the Jersey coast, having
an idea where you were bound, and we don't intend to lose you now."

"Do you mean to follow us?" asked Captain Weston softly.

"Well, you can put it that way if you like," answered one of the two
men with Mr. Berg.

"I forbid it!" cried Mr. Swift hotly. "You have no right to sneak after
us."

"I guess the ocean is free," continued the rascally agent.

"Why do you persist in keeping after us?" inquired the aged inventor,
thinking it well to ascertain, if possible, just how much the men knew.

"Because we're after that treasure as well as you," was the bold reply.
"You have no exclusive right to it. The sunken ship is awaiting the
first comer, and whoever gets there first can take the gold from the
wreck. We intend to be there first, but we'll be fair with you."

"Fair? What do you mean?" demanded Tom.

"This: We'll race you for it. The first one to arrive will have the
right to search the wreck for the gold bullion. Is that fair? Do you
agree to it?"

"We agree to nothing with you," interrupted Captain Weston, his usual
diffident manner all gone. "I happen to be in partial command of this
craft, and I warn you that if I find you interfering with us it won't
be healthy for you.  I'm not fond of fighting, but when I begin I don't
like to stop," and he smiled grimly. "You'd better not follow us."

"We'll do as we please," shouted the third member of the trio on the
deck of the other boat, which, as Tom could see, was named the Wonder.
"We intend to get that gold if we can."

"All right. I've warned you," went on the sailor, and then, motioning
to Tom and his father to follow, he went below.

"Well, what's to be done?" asked Mr. Swift when they were seated in the
living-room, and had informed the others of the presence of the rival
submarine.

"The only thing I see to do is to sneak away unobserved, go as deep as
possible, and make all haste for the wreck," advised the captain. "They
will depend on us, for they have evidently no chart of the wreck,
though of course the general location of it may be known to them from
reading the papers. I hoped I had thrown them off the track by the
false chart I dropped, but it seems they were too smart for us."

"Have they a right to follow us?" asked Tom.

"Legally, but not morally. We can't prevent them, I'm afraid. The only
thing to do is to get there ahead of them.  It will be a race for the
sunken treasure, and we must get there first."

"What do you propose doing, captain?" asked Mr. Damon.  "Bless my
shirt-studs, but can't we pull their ship up on the island and leave it
there?"

"I'm afraid such high-handed proceedings would hardly answer," replied
Mr. Swift. "No, as Captain Weston says, we must get there ahead of
them. What do you think will be the best scheme, captain?"

"Well, there's no need for us to forego our plan to get fresh water.
Suppose we go to the island, that is, some of us, leaving a guard on
board here. We'll fill our tanks with fresh water, and at night we'll
quietly sink below the surface and speed away."

They all voted that an excellent idea, and little time was lost putting
it into operation.

All the remainder of that day not a sign of life was visible about the
Wonder. She lay inert on the surface of the lagoon, not far away from
the Advance; but, though no one showed himself on the deck, Tom and his
friends had no doubt but that their enemies were closely watching them.

As dusk settled down over the tropical sea, and as the shadows of the
trees on the little island lengthened, those on board the Advance
closed the Conning tower. No lights were turned on, as they did not
want their movements to be seen, but Tom, his father and Mr. Sharp took
their positions near the various machines and apparatus, ready to open
the tanks and let the submarine sink to the bottom, as soon as it was
possible to do this unobserved.

"Luckily there's no moon," remarked Captain Weston, as he took his
place beside Tom. "Once below the surface and we can defy them to find
us. It is odd how they traced us, but I suppose that steamer gave them
the clue."

It rapidly grew dark, as it always does in the tropics, and when a
cautious observation from the conning tower did not disclose the
outlines of the other boat, those aboard the Advance rightly concluded
that their rivals were unable to see them.

"Send her down, Tom," called his father, and with a hiss the water
entered the tanks. The submarine quickly sank below the surface, aided
by the deflecting rudder.

But alas for the hopes of the gold-seekers. No sooner was she
completely submerged, with the engine started so as to send her out of
the lagoon and to the open sea, than the waters all about were made
brilliant by the phosphorescent phenomenon. In southern waters this
frequently occurs.  Millions of tiny creatures, which, it is said,
swarm in the warm currents, give an appearance of fire to the ocean,
and any object moving through it can plainly be seen. It was so with
the Advance. The motion she made in shooting forward, and the
undulations caused by her submersion, seemed to start into activity the
dormant phosphorus, and the submarine was afloat in a sea of fire.

"Quick!" cried Tom. "Speed her up! Maybe we can get out of this patch
of water before they see us."

But it was too late. Above them they could hear the electric siren of
the Wonder as it was blown to let them know that their escape had been
noticed. A moment later the water, which acted as a sort of
sounding-board, or telephone, brought to the ears of Tom Swift and his
friends the noise of the engines of the other craft in operation.  She
was coming after them. The race for the possession of three hundred
thousand dollars in gold was already under way. Fate seemed against
those on board the Advance.




Chapter Seventeen

The Race


Directed by Captain Weston, who glanced at the compass and told him
which way to steer to clear the outer coral reef, Tom sent the
submarine ahead, signaling for full speed to the engine-room, where his
father and Mr. Sharp were. The big dynamos purred like great cats, as
they sent the electrical energy into the forward and aft plates,
pulling and pushing the Advance forward. On and on she rushed under
water, but ever as she shot ahead the disturbance in the phosphorescent
water showed her position plainly. She would be easy to follow.

"Can't you get any more speed out of her?" asked the captain of the lad.

"Yes," was the quick reply; "by using the auxiliary screws I think we
can. I'll try it."

He signaled for the propellers, forward and aft, to be put in
operation, and the motor moving the twin screws was turned on. At once
there was a perceptible increase to the speed of the Advance.

"Are we leaving them behind?" asked Tom anxiously, as he glanced at the
speed gage, and noted that the submarine was now about five hundred
feet below the surface.

"Hard to tell," replied the Captain. "You'd have to take an observation
to make sure."

"I'll do it," cried the youth. "You steer, please, and I'll go in the
conning tower. I can look forward and aft there, as well as straight
up. Maybe I can see the Wonder."

Springing up the circular ladder leading into the tower, Tom glanced
through the windows all about the small pilot house. He saw a curious
sight. It was as if the submarine was in a sea of yellowish liquid
fire. She was immersed in water which glowed with the flames that
contained no heat.  So light was it, in fact, that there was no need of
the incandescents in the tower. The young inventor could have seen to
read a paper by the illumination of the phosphorus.  But he had
something else to do than observe this phenomenon. He wanted to see if
he could catch sight of the rival submarine.

At first he could make out nothing save the swirl and boiling of the
sea, caused by the progress of the Advance through it. But suddenly, as
he looked up, he was aware of some great, black body a little to the
rear and about ten feet above his craft.

"A shark!" he exclaimed aloud. "An immense one, too."

But the closer he looked the less it seemed like a shark.  The position
of the black object changed. It appeared to settle down, to be
approaching the top of the conning tower.  Then, with a suddenness that
unnerved him for the time being, Tom recognized what it was; it was the
underside of a ship. He could see the plates riveted together, and
then, as he noted the rounded, cylindrical shape, he knew that it was a
submarine. It was the Wonder. She was close at hand and was creeping up
on the Advance. But, what was more dangerous, she seemed to be slowly
settling in the water.  Another moment and her great screws might crash
into the Conning tower of the Swifts' boat and shave it off. Then the
water would rush in, drowning the treasure-seekers like rats in a trap.

With a quick motion Tom yanked over the lever that allowed more water
to flow into the ballast tanks. The effect was at once apparent. The
Advance shot down toward the bottom of the sea. At the same time the
young inventor signaled to Captain Weston to notify those in the
engine-room to put on a little more speed. The Advance fairly leaped
ahead, and the lad, looking up through the bull's-eye in the roof of
the conning tower, had the satisfaction of seeing the rival submarine
left behind.

The youth hurried down into the interior of the ship to tell what he
had seen, and explain the reason for opening the ballast tanks. He
found his father and Mr. Sharp somewhat excited over the unexpected
maneuver of the craft.

"So they're still following us," murmured Mr. Swift. "I don't see why
we can't shake them off."

"It's on account of this luminous water," explained Captain Weston.
"Once we are clear of that it will be easy, I think, to give them the
slip. That is, if we can get out of their sight long enough. Of course,
if they keep close after us, they can pick us up with their
searchlight, for I suppose they carry one."

"Yes," admitted the aged inventor, "they have as strong a one as we
have. In fact, their ship is second only to this one in speed and
power. I know, for Bentley & Eagert showed me some of the plans before
they started it, and asked my opinion. This was before I had the notion
of building a submarine. Yes, I am afraid we'll have trouble getting
away from them."

"I can't understand this phosphorescent glow keeping up so long,"
remarked Captain Weston. "I've seen it in this locality several times,
but it never covered such an extent of the ocean in my time.  There
must be changed conditions here now."

For an hour or more the race was kept up, and the two submarines forged
ahead through the glowing sea. The Wonder remained slightly above and
to the rear of the other, the better to keep sight of her, and though
the Advance was run to her limit of speed, her rival could not be
shaken off.  Clearly the Wonder was a speedy craft.

"It's too bad that we've got to fight them, as well as run the risk of
lots of other troubles which are always present when sailing under
water," observed Mr Damon, who wandered about the submarine like the
nervous person he was. "Bless my shirt-studs! Can't we blow them up, or
cripple them in some way? They have no right to go after our treasure."

"Well, I guess they've got as much right as we have," declared Tom. "It
goes to whoever reaches the wreck first.  But what I don't like is
their mean, sneaking way of doing it. If they went off on their own
hook and looked for it I wouldn't say a word. But they expect us to
lead them to the wreck, and then they'll rob us if they can. That's not
fair."

"Indeed, it isn't," agreed Captain Weston, "if I may be allowed the
expression. We ought to find some way of stopping them. But, if I'm not
mistaken," he added quickly, looking from one of the port bull's-eyes,
"the phosphorescent glow is lessening. I believe we are running beyond
that part of the ocean."

There was no doubt of it, the glow was growing less and less, and ten
minutes later the Advance was speeding along through a sea as black as
night. Then, to avoid running into some wreck, it was necessary to turn
on the searchlight.

"Are they still after us?" asked Mr. Swift of his son, as he emerged
from the engine-room, where he had gone to make some adjustments to the
machinery, with the hope of increasing the speed.

"I'll go look," volunteered the lad. He climbed up into the conning
tower again, and for a moment, as he gazed back into the black waters
swirling all about, he hoped that they had lost the Wonder. But a
moment later his heart sank as he caught sight, through the liquid
element, of the flickering gleams of another searchlight, the rays
undulating through the sea.

"Still following," murmured the young inventor. "They're not going to
give up. But we must make 'em--that's all."

He went down to report what he had seen, and a consultation was held.
Captain Weston carefully studied the charts of that part of the ocean,
and finding that there was a great depth of water at hand, proposed a
series of evolutions.

"We can go up and down, shoot first to one side and then to the other,"
he explained. "We can even drop down to the bottom and rest there for a
while. Perhaps, in that way, we can shake them off."

They tried it. The Advance was sent up until her conning tower was out
of the water, and then she was suddenly forced down until she was but a
few feet from the bottom. She darted to the left, to the right, and
even doubled and went back over the course she had taken. But all to no
purpose.  The Wonder proved fully as speedy, and those in her seemed to
know just how to handle the submarine, so that every evolution of the
Advance was duplicated. Her rival could not be shaken off.

All night this was kept up, and when morning came, though only the
clocks told it, for eternal night was below the surface, the rival
gold-seekers were still on the trail.

"They won't give up," declared Mr. Swift hopelessly.

"No, we've got to race them for it, just as Berg proposed," admitted
Tom. "But if they want a straightaway race we'll give it to 'em. Let's
run her to the limit, dad."

"That's what we've been doing, Tom."

"No, not exactly, for we've been submerged a little too much to get the
best speed out of our craft. Let's go a little nearer the surface, and
give them the best race they'll ever have."

Then the race began; and such a contest of speed as it was! With her
propellers working to the limit, and every volt of electricity that was
available forced into the forward and aft plates, the Advance surged
through the water, about ten feet below the surface. But the Wonder
kept after her, giving her knot for knot. The course of the leading
submarine was easy to trace now, in the morning light which penetrated
ten feet down.

"No use," remarked Tom again, when, after two hours, the Wonder was
still close behind them. "Our only chance is that they may have a
breakdown."

"Or run out of air, or something like that," added Captain Weston.
"They are crowding us pretty close. I had no idea they could keep up
this speed. If they don't look out," he went on as he looked from one
of the aft observation windows, "they'll foul us, and--"

His remarks were interrupted by a jar to the Advance. She seemed to
shiver and careened to one side. Then came another bump.

"Slow down!" cried the captain, rushing toward the pilot house.

"What's the matter?" asked Tom, as he threw the engines and electrical
machines out of gear. "Have we hit anything?"

"No. Something has hit us," cried the captain. "Their submarine has
rammed us."

"Rammed us!" repeated Mr. Swift. "Tom, run out the electric cannon!
They're trying to sink us! We'll have to fight them. Run out the stern
electric gun and we'll make them wish they'd not followed us."




Chapter Eighteen

The Electric Gun


There was much  excitement aboard the Advance. The submarine came to a
stop in the water, while the treasure-seekers waited anxiously for what
was to follow. Would they be rammed again? This time, stationary as
they were, and with the other boat coming swiftly on, a hole might be
stove through the Advance, in spite of her powerful sides.

They had not long to wait. Again there came a jar, and once more the
Swifts' boat careened. But the blow was a glancing one and,
fortunately, did little damage.

"They certainly must be trying to sink us," agreed Captain Weston.
"Come, Tom, we'll take a look from the stern and see what they're up
to."

"And get the stern electric gun ready to fire," repeated Mr. Swift. "We
must protect ourselves. Mr. Sharp and I will go to the bow. There is no
telling what they may do. They're desperate, and may ram us from in
front."

Tom and the captain hurried aft. Through the thick plate-glass windows
they could see the blunt nose of the Wonder not far away, the rival
submarine having come to a halt.  There she lay, black and silent, like
some monster fish waiting to devour its victim.

"There doesn't appear to be much damage done back here," observed Tom.
"No leaks. Guess they didn't puncture us."

"Perhaps it was due to an accident that they rammed us," suggested the
captain.

"Well, they wouldn't have done it if they hadn't followed us so close,"
was the opinion of the young inventor.  "They're taking too many
chances. We've got to stop 'em."

"What is this electric gun your father speaks of?"

"Why, it's a regular electric cannon. It fires a solid ball, weighing
about twenty-five pounds, but instead of powder, which would hardly do
under water, and instead of compressed air, which is used in the
torpedo tubes of the Government submarines, we use a current of
electricity. It forces the cannon ball out with great energy."

"I wonder what they will do next?" observed the captain, peering
through a bull's eye.

"We can soon tell," replied the youth. "We'll go ahead, and if they try
to follow I'm going to fire on them."

"Suppose you sink them?"

"I won't fire to do that; only to disable them. They brought it on
themselves. We can't risk having them damage us. Help me with the
cannon, will you please, captain?"

The electric cannon was a long, steel tube in the after part of the
submarine. It projected a slight distance from the sides of the ship,
and by an ingenious arrangement could be swung around in a ball and
socket joint, thus enabling it to shoot in almost any direction.

It was the work of but a few minutes to get it ready and, with the
muzzle pointing toward the Wonder, Tom adjusted the electric wires and
inserted the solid shot.

"Now we're prepared for them!" he cried. "I think a good plan will be
to start ahead, and if they try to follow to fire on them. They've
brought it on themselves."

"Correct," spoke Captain Weston.

Tom hurried forward to tell his father of this plan.

"We'll do it!" cried Mr. Swift. "Go ahead, Mr. Sharp, and we'll see if
those scoundrels will follow."

The young inventor returned on the run to the electric cannon. There
was a whir of machinery, and the Advance moved forward. She increased
her speed, and the two watchers in the stern looked anxiously out of
the windows to see what their rivals would do.

For a moment no movement was noticeable on the part of the Wonder.
Then, as those aboard her appeared to realize that the craft on which
they depended to pilot them to the sunken treasure was slipping away,
word was given to follow. The ship of Berg and his employers shot after
the Advance.

"Here they come!" cried Captain Weston. "They're going to ram us again!"

"Then I'm going to fire on them!" declared Tom savagely.

On came the Wonder, nearer and nearer. Her speed was rapidly
increasing. Suddenly she bumped the Advance, and then, as if it was an
unavoidable accident, the rear submarine sheered off to one side.

"They're certainly at it again!" cried Tom, and peering from the
bull's-eye he saw the Wonder shoot past the mouth of the electric
cannon. "Here it goes!" he added.

He shoved over the lever, making the proper connection.  There was no
corresponding report, for the cannon was noiseless, but there was a
slight jar as the projectile left the muzzle. The Wonder could be seen
to heel over.

"You hit her! You hit her!" cried Captain Weston. "A good shot!"

"I was afraid she was past me when I pulled the lever," explained Tom.
"She went like a flash."

"No, you caught her on the rudder," declared the captain.  "I think
you've put her out of business. Yes, they're rising to the surface."

The lad rapidly inserted another ball, and recharged the cannon. Then
he peered out into the water, illuminated by the light of day overhead,
as they were not far down. He could see the Wonder rising to the
surface. Clearly something had happened.

"Maybe they're going to drop down on us from above, and try to sink
us," suggested the youth, while he stood ready to fire again. "If they
do--"

His words were interrupted by a slight jar throughout the submarine.

"What was that?" cried the captain.

"Dad fired the bow gun at them, but I don't believe he hit them,"
answered the young inventor.

"I wonder what damage I did? Guess we'll go to the surface to find out."

Clearly the Wonder had given up the fight for the time being. In fact,
she had no weapon with which to respond to a fusillade from her rival.
Tom hastened forward and informed his father of what had happened.

"If her steering gear is out of order, we may have a chance to slip
away," said Mr. Swift "We'll go up and see what we can learn."

A few minutes later Tom, his father and Captain Weston stepped from the
conning tower, which was out of water, on to the little flat deck a
short distance away lay the Wonder, and on her deck was Berg and a
number of men, evidently members of the crew.

"Why did you fire on us?" shouted the agent angrily.

"Why did you follow us?" retorted Tom.

"Well, you've broken our rudder and disabled us," went on Berg, not
answering the question. "You'll suffer for this!  I'll have you
arrested."

"You only got what you deserved," added Mr. Swift. "You were acting
illegally, following us, and you tried to sink us by ramming my craft
before we retaliated by firing on you."

"It was an accident, ramming you," said Berg. "We couldn't help it. I
now demand that you help us make repairs."

"Well, you've got nerve!" cried Captain Weston, his eyes flashing. "I'd
like to have a personal interview with you for about ten minutes. Maybe
something besides your ship would need repairs then."

Berg turned away, scowling, but did not reply. He began directing the
crew what to do about the broken rudder.

"Come on," proposed Tom in a low voice, for sounds carry very easily
over water. "Let's go below and skip out while we have a chance. They
can't follow now, and we can get to the sunken treasure ahead of them."

"Good advice," commented his father. "Come, Captain Weston, we'll go
below and close the conning tower."

Five minutes later the Advance sank from sight, the last glimpse Tom
had of Berg and his men being a sight of them standing on the deck of
their floating boat, gazing in the direction of their successful rival.
The Wonder was left behind, while Tom and his friends were soon once
more speeding toward the treasure wreck.




Chapter Nineteen

Captured


"Down deep," advised Captain Weston, as he stood beside Tom and Mr.
Swift in the pilot house. "As far as you can manage her, and then
forward. We'll take no more chances with these fellows."

"The only trouble is," replied the young inventor, "that the deeper we
go the slower we have to travel. The water is so dense that it holds us
back."

"Well, there is no special need of hurrying now," went on the sailor.
"No one is following you, and two or three days difference in reaching
the wreck will not amount to anything."

"Unless they repair their rudder, and take after us again," suggested
Mr. Swift.

"They're not very likely to do that," was the captain's opinion. "It
was more by luck than good management that they picked us up before.
Now, having to delay, as they will, to repair their steering gear,
while we can go as deep as we please and speed ahead, it is practically
impossible for them to catch up to us. No, I think we have nothing to
fear from them."

But though danger from Berg and his crowd was somewhat remote, perils
of another sort were hovering around the treasure-seekers, and they
were soon to experience them.

It was much different from sailing along in the airship, Tom thought,
for there was no blue sky and fleecy clouds to see, and they could not
look down and observe, far below them, cities and villages. Nor could
they breathe the bracing atmosphere of the upper regions.

But if there was lack of the rarefied air of the clouds, there was no
lack of fresh atmosphere. The big tanks carried a large supply, and
whenever more was needed the oxygen machine would supply it.

As there was no need, however, of remaining under water for any great
stretch of time, it was their practice to rise every day and renew the
air supply, also to float along on the surface for a while, or speed
along, with only the conning tower out, in order to afford a view, and
to enable Captain Weston to take observations. But care was always
exercised to make sure no ships were in sight when emerging on the
surface, for the gold-seekers did not want to be hailed and questioned
by inquisitive persons.

It was about four days after the disabling of the rival submarine, and
the Advance was speeding along about a mile and a half under water. Tom
was in the pilot house with Captain Weston, Mr. Damon was at his
favorite pastime of looking out of the glass side windows into the
ocean and its wonders, and Mr. Swift and the balloonist were, as
usual, in the engine-room.

"How near do you calculate we are to the sunken wreck?" asked Tom of
his companion.

"Well, at the calculation we made yesterday, we are within about a
thousand miles of it now. We ought to reach it in about four more days,
if we don't have any accidents."

"And how deep do you think it is?" went on the lad.

"Well, I'm afraid it's pretty close to two miles, if not more. It's
quite a depth, and of course impossible for ordinary divers to reach.
But it will be possible in this submarine and in the strong diving
suits your father has invented for us to get to it. Yes, I don't
anticipate much trouble in getting out the gold, once we reach the
wreck of course--"

The captain's remark was not finished. From the engine-room there came
a startled shout:

"Tom! Tom! Your father is hurt! Come here, quick!"

"Take the wheel!" cried the lad to the captain. "I must go to my
father." It was Mr. Sharp's voice he had heard.

Racing to the engine-room, Tom saw his parent doubled up over a dynamo,
while to one side, his hand on a copper switch, stood Mr. Sharp.

"What's the matter?" shouted the lad.

"He's held there by a current of electricity," replied the balloonist.
"The wires are crossed."

"Why don't you shut off the current?" demanded the youth, as he
prepared to pull his parent from the whirring machine.  Then he
hesitated, for he feared he, too, would be glued fast by the terrible
current, and so be unable to help Mr. Swift.

"I'm held fast here, too," replied the balloonist. "I started to cut
out the current at this switch, but there's a short circuit somewhere,
and I can't let go, either. Quick, shut off all power at the main
switchboard forward."

Tom realized that this was the only thing to do. He ran forward and
with a yank cut out all the electric wires. With a sigh of relief Mr.
Sharp pulled his hands from the copper where he had been held fast as
if by some powerful magnet, his muscles cramped by the current.
Fortunately the electricity was of low voltage, and he was not burned.
The body of Mr. Swift toppled backward from the dynamo, as Tom sprang
to reach his father.

"He's dead!" he cried, as he saw the pale face and the closed eyes.

"No, only badly shocked, I hope," spoke Mr. Sharp. "But we must get him
to the fresh air at once. Start the tank pumps.  We'll rise to the
surface."

The youth needed no second bidding. Once more turning on the electric
current, he set the powerful pumps in motion and the submarine began to
rise. Then, aided by Captain Weston and Mr. Damon, the young inventor
carried his father to a couch in the main cabin. Mr. Sharp took charge
of the machinery.

Restoratives were applied, and there was a flutter of the eyelids of
the aged inventor.

"I think he'll come around all right," said the sailor kindly, as he
saw Tom's grief. "Fresh air will be the thing for him. We'll be on the
surface in a minute."

Up shot the Advance, while Mr. Sharp stood ready to open the conning
tower as soon as it should be out of water. Mr. Swift seemed to be
rapidly reviving. With a bound the submarine, forced upward from the
great depth, fairly shot out of the water. There was a clanking sound
as the aeronaut opened the airtight door of the tower, and a breath of
fresh air came in.

"Can you walk, dad, or shall we carry you?" asked Tom solicitously.

"Oh, I--I'm feeling better now," was the inventor's reply.  "I'll soon
be all right when I get out on deck. My foot slipped as I was adjusting
a wire that had gotten out of order, and I fell so that I received a
large part of the current. I'm glad I was not burned. Was Mr. Sharp
hurt? I saw him run to the switch, just before I lost consciousness."

"No, I'm all right," answered the balloonist. "But allow us to get you
out to the fresh air. You'll feel much better then."

Mr. Swift managed to walk slowly to the ladder leading to the conning
tower, and thence to the deck. The others followed him. As all emerged
from the submarine they uttered a cry of astonishment.

There, not one hundred yards away, was a great warship, flying a flag
which, in a moment, Tom recognized as that of Brazil. The cruiser was
lying off a small island, and all about were small boats, filled with
natives, who seemed to be bringing supplies from land to the ship. At
the unexpected sight of the submarine, bobbing up from the bottom of
the ocean, the natives uttered cries of fright.  The attention of those
on the warship was attracted, and the bridge and rails were lined with
curious officers and men.

"It's a good thing we didn't come up under that ship," observed Tom.
"They would have thought we were trying to torpedo her. Do you feel
better, dad?" he asked, his wonder over the sight of the big vessel
temporarily eclipsed in his anxiety for his parent.

"Oh, yes, much better. I'm all right now. But I wish we hadn't
disclosed ourselves to these people. They may demand to know where we
are going, and Brazil is too near Uruguay to make it safe to tell our
errand. They may guess it, however, from having read of the wreck, and
our departure."

"Oh, I guess it will be all right," replied Captain Weston. "We can
tell them we are on a pleasure trip. That's true enough. It would give
us great pleasure to find that gold."

"There's a boat, with some officers in it, to judge by the amount of
gold lace on them, putting off from the ship," remarked Mr. Sharp.

"Ha! Yes! Evidently they intend to pay us a formal visit," observed Mr.
Damon. "Bless my gaiters, though. I'm not dressed to receive company. I
think I'll put on my dress suit."

"It's too late," advised Tom. "They'll be here in a minute."

Urged on by the lusty arms of the Brazilian sailors, the boat,
containing several officers, neared the floating submarine rapidly.

"Ahoy there!" called an officer in the bow, his accent betraying his
unfamiliarity with the English language. "What craft are you?"

"Submarine, Advance, from New Jersey," replied Tom. "Who are you?"

"Brazilian cruiser San Paulo," was the reply. "Where are you bound?"
went on the officer.

"On pleasure," answered Captain Weston quickly. "But why do you ask? We
are an American ship, sailing under American colors. Is this Brazilian
territory?"

"This island is--yes," came back the answer, and by this time the small
boat was at the side of the submarine. Before the adventurers could
have protested, had they a desire to do so, there were a number of
officers and the crew of the San Paulo on the small deck.

With a flourish, the officer who had done the questioning drew his
sword. Waving it in the air with a dramatic gesture, he exclaimed:

"You're our prisoners! Resist and my men shall cut you down like dogs!
Seize them, men!"

The sailors sprang forward, each one stationing himself at the side of
one of our friends, and grasping an arm.

"What does this mean?" cried Captain Weston indignantly.  "If this is a
joke, you're carrying it too far. If you're in earnest, let me warn you
against interfering with Americans!"

"We know what we are doing," was the answer from the officer.

The sailor who had hold of Captain Weston endeavored to secure a
tighter grip. The captain turned suddenly, and seizing the man about
the waist, with an exercise of tremendous strength hurled him over his
head and into the sea, the man making a great splash.

"That's the way I'll treat any one else who dares lay a hand on me!"
shouted the captain, who was transformed from a mild-mannered
individual into an angry, modern giant. There was a gasp of
astonishment at his feat, as the ducked sailor crawled back into the
small boat. And he did not again venture on the deck of the submarine.

"Seize them, men!" cried the gold-laced officer again, and this time he
and his fellows, including the crew, crowded so closely around Tom and
his friends that they could do nothing. Even Captain Weston found it
impossible to offer any resistance, for three men grabbed hold of him
but his spirit was still a fighting one, and he struggled desperately
but uselessly.

"How dare you do this?" he cried.

"Yes," added Tom, "what right have you to interfere with us?"

"Every right," declared the gold-laced officer.

"You are in Brazilian territory, and I arrest you."

"What for?" demanded Mr. Sharp.

"Because your ship is an American submarine, and we have received word
that you intend to damage our shipping, and may try to torpedo our
warships. I believe you tried to disable us a little while ago, but
failed. We consider that an act of war and you will be treated
accordingly. Take them on board the San Paulo," the officer went on,
turning to his aides. "We'll try them by court-marital here. Some of
you remain and guard this submarine. We will teach these filibustering
Americans a lesson."




Chapter Twenty

Doomed to Death


There was no room on the small deck of the submarine to make a stand
against the officers and crew of the Brazilian warship. In fact, the
capture of the gold-seekers had been effected so suddenly that their
astonishment almost deprived them of the power to think clearly.

At another command from the officer, who was addressed as Admiral
Fanchetti, several of the sailors began to lead Tom and his friends
toward the small boat.

"Do you feel all right, father?" inquired the lad anxiously, as he
looked at his parent. "These scoundrels have no right to treat us so."

"Yes, Tom, I'm all right as far as the electric shock is concerned, but
I don't like to be handled in this fashion."

"We ought not to submit!" burst out Mr. Damon. "Bless the stars and
stripes! We ought to fight."

"There's no chance," said Mr. Sharp. "We are right under the guns of
the ship. They could sink us with one shot. I guess we'll have to give
in for the time being."

"It is most unpleasant, if I may be allowed the expression," commented
Captain Weston mildly. He seemed to have lost his sudden anger, but
there was a steely glint in his eyes, and a grim, set look around his
month that showed his temper was kept under control only by an effort.
It boded no good to the sailors who had hold of the doughty captain if
he should once get loose, and it was noticed that they were on their
guard.

As for Tom, he submitted quietly to the two Brazilians who had hold of
either arm, and Mr. Swift was held by only one, for it was seen that he
was feeble.

"Into the boat with them!" cried Admiral Fanchetti. "And guard them
well, Lieutenant Drascalo, for I heard them plotting to escape," and
the admiral signaled to a younger officer, who was in charge of the men
guarding the prisoners.

"Lieutenant Drascalo, eh?" murmured Mr. Damon. "I think they made a
mistake naming him. It ought to be Rascalo. He looks like a rascal."

"Silenceo!" exclaimed the lieutenant, scowling at the odd character.

"Bless my spark plug! He's a regular fire-eater!" went on Mr. Damon,
who appeared to have fully recovered his spirits.

"Silenceo!" cried the lieutenant, scowling again, but Mr. Damon did not
appear to mind.

Admiral Fanchetti and several others of the gold-laced officers
remained aboard the submarine, while Tom and his friends were hustled
into the small boat and rowed toward the warship.

"I hope they don't damage our craft," murmured the young inventor, as
he saw the admiral enter the conning tower.

"If they do, we'll complain to the United States consul and demand
damages," said Mr. Swift.

"I'm afraid we won't have a chance to communicate with the consul,"
remarked Captain Weston.

"What do you mean?" asked Mr. Damon. "Bless my shoelaces, but will
these scoundrels--"

"Silenceo!" cried Lieutenant Drascalo quickly. "Dogs of Americans, do
you wish to insult us?"

"Impossible; you wouldn't appreciate a good, genuine United States
insult," murmured Tom under his breath.

"What I mean," went on the captain, "is that these people may carry the
proceedings off with a high hand. You heard the admiral speak of a
court-martial."

"Would they dare do that?" inquired Mr. Sharp.

"They would dare anything in this part of the world, I'm afraid,"
resumed Captain Weston. "I think I see their plan, though. This admiral
is newly in command; his uniform shows that. He wants to make a name for
himself, and he seizes on our submarine as an excuse. He can send word
to his government that he destroyed a torpedo craft that sought to
wreck his ship. Thus he will acquire a reputation."

"But would his government support him in such a hostile act against the
United States, a friendly nation?" asked Tom.

"Oh, he would not claim to have acted against the United States as a
power. He would say that it was a private submarine, and, as a matter
of fact, it is. While we are under the protection of the stars and
stripes, our vessel is not a Government one," and Captain Weston spoke
the last in a low voice, so the scowling lieutenant could not hear.

"What will they do with us?" inquired Mr. Swift.

"Have some sort of a court-martial, perhaps," went on the captain, "and
confiscate our craft. Then they will send us back home, I expect for
they would not dare harm us."

"But take our submarine!" cried Tom. "The villains--"

"Silenceo!" shouted Lieutenant Drascalo and he drew his sword.

By this time the small boat was under the big guns of the San Paulo,
and the prisoners were ordered, in broken English, to mount a companion
ladder that hung over the side. In a short time they were on deck, amid
a crowd of sailors, and they could see the boat going back to bring off
the admiral, who signaled from the submarine. Tom and his friends were
taken below to a room that looked like a prison, and there, a little
later, they were visited by Admiral Fanchetti and several officers.

"You will be tried at once," said the admiral. "I have examined your
submarine and I find she carries two torpedo tubes. It is a wonder you
did not sink me at once."

"Those are not torpedo tubes!" cried Tom, unable to keep silent, though
Captain Weston motioned him to do so.

"I know torpedo tubes when I see them," declared the admiral. "I
consider I had a very narrow escape. Your country is fortunate that
mine does not declare war against it for this act. But I take it you
are acting privately, for you fly no flag, though you claim to be from
the United States."

"There's no place for a flag on the submarine," went on Tom. "What good
would it be under water?"

"Silenceo!" cried Lieutenant Drascalo, the admonition to silence
seeming to be the only command of which he was capable.

"I shall confiscate your craft for my government," went on the admiral,
"and shall punish you as the court-martial may direct. You will be
tried at once."

It was in vain for the prisoners to protest. Matters were carried with
a high hand. They were allowed a spokesman, and Captain Weston, who
understood Spanish, was selected, that language being used. But the
defense was a farce, for he was scarcely listened to. Several officers
testified before the admiral, who was judge, that they had seen the
submarine rise out of the water, almost under the prow of the San
Paulo. It was assumed that the Advance had tried to wreck the warship,
but had failed. It was in vain that Captain Weston and the others told
of the reason for their rapid ascent from the ocean depths--that Mr.
Swift had been shocked, and needed fresh air. Their story was not
believed.

"We have heard enough!" suddenly exclaimed the admiral.  "The evidence
against you is over-whelming--er--what you Americans call conclusive,"
and he was speaking then in broken English. "I find you guilty, and the
sentence of this court-martial is that you be shot at sunrise, three
days hence!"

"Shot!" cried Captain Weston, staggering back at this unexpected
sentence. His companions turned white, and Mr. Swift leaned against his
son for support.

"Bless my stars! Of all the scoundrelly!" began Mr. Damon.

"Silenceo!" shouted the lieutenant, waving his sword.

"You will be shot," proceeded the admiral. "Is not that the verdict of
the honorable court?" he asked, looking at his fellow officers. They
all nodded gravely.

"But look here!" objected Captain Weston. "You don't dare do that! We
are citizens of the United States, and--"

"I consider you no better than pirates," interrupted the admiral. "You
have an armed submarine--a submarine with torpedo tubes. You invade our
harbor with it, and come up almost under my ship. You have forfeited
your right to the protection of your country, and I have no fear on
that score. You will be shot within three days. That is all.  Remove
the prisoners."

Protests were in vain, and it was equally useless to struggle. The
prisoners were taken out on deck, for which they were thankful, for the
interior of the ship was close and hot, the weather being intensely
disagreeable. They were told to keep within a certain space on deck,
and a guard of sailors, all armed, was placed near them. From where
they were they could see their submarine floating on the surface of the
little bay, with several Brazilians on the small deck. The Advance had
been anchored, and was surrounded by a flotilla of the native boats,
the brown-skinned paddlers gazing curiously at the odd craft.

"Well, this is tough luck!" murmured Tom. "How do you feel, dad?"

"As well as can be expected under the circumstances," was the reply.
"What do you think about this, Captain Weston?"

"Not very much, if I may be allowed the expression," was the answer.

"Do you think they will dare carry out that threat?" asked Mr. Sharp.

The captain shrugged his shoulders. "I hope it is only a bluff," he
replied, "made to scare us so we will consent to giving up the
submarine, which they have no right to confiscate. But these fellows
look ugly enough for anything," he went on.

"Then if there's any chance of them attempting to carry it out," spoke
Tom, "we've got to do something."

"Bless my gizzard, of course!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "But what? That's
the question. To be shot! Why, that's a terrible threat! The villains--"

"Silenceo!" shouted Lieutenant Drascalo, coming up at that moment.




Chapter Twenty-One

The Escape


Events had happened so quickly that day that the gold-hunters could
scarcely comprehend them. It seemed only a short time since Mr. Swift
had been discovered lying disabled on the dynamo, and what had
transpired since seemed to have taken place in a few minutes, though it
was, in reality, several hours. This was made manifest by the feeling
of hunger on the part of Tom and his friends.

"I wonder if they're going to starve us, the scoundrels?" asked Mr.
Sharp, when the irate lieutenant was beyond hearing. "It's not fair to
make us go hungry and shoot us in the bargain."

"That's so, they ought to feed us," put in Tom. As yet neither he nor
the others fully realized the meaning of the sentence passed on them.

From where they were on deck they could look off to the little island.
From it boats manned by natives were constantly putting off, bringing
supplies to the ship. The place appeared to be a sort of calling
station for Brazilian warships, where they could get fresh water and
fruit and other food.

From the island the gaze of the adventurers wandered to the submarine,
which lay not far away. They were chagrined to see several of the
bolder natives clambering over the deck.

"I hope they keep out of the interior," commented Tom. "If they get to
pulling or hauling on the levers and wheels they may open the tanks and
sink her, with the Conning tower open."

"Better that, perhaps, than to have her fall into the hands of a
foreign power," commented Captain Weston.  "Besides, I don't see that
it's going to matter much to us what becomes of her after we're--"

He did not finish, but every one knew what he meant, and a grim silence
fell upon the little group.

There came a welcome diversion, however, in the shape of three sailors,
bearing trays of food, which were placed on the deck in front of the
prisoners, who were sitting or lying in the shade of an awning, for the
sun was very hot.

"Ha! Bless my napkin-ring!" cried Mr. Damon with something of his
former gaiety. "Here's a meal, at all events. They don't intend to
starve us. Eat hearty, every one."

"Yes, we need to keep up our strength," observed Captain Weston.

"Why?" inquired Mr. Sharp.

"Because we're going to try to escape!" exclaimed Tom in a low voice,
when the sailors who had brought the food had gone. "Isn't that what
you mean, captain?"

"Exactly. We'll try to give these villains the slip, and we'll need all
our strength and wits to do it. We'll wait until night, and see what we
can do."

"But where will we escape to?" asked Mr. Swift. "The island will afford
no shelter, and--"

"No, but our submarine will," went on the sailor.

"It's in the possession of the Brazilians," objected Tom.

"Once I get aboard the Advance twenty of those brown-skinned villains
won't keep me prisoner," declared Captain Weston fiercely. "If we can
only slip away from here, get into the small boat, or even swim to the
submarine, I'll make those chaps on board her think a hurricane has
broken loose."

"Yes, and I'll help," said Mr. Damon.

"And I," added Tom and the balloonist.

"That's the way to talk," commented the captain. "Now let's eat, for I
see that rascally lieutenant coming this way, and we mustn't appear to
be plotting, or he'll be suspicious."

The day passed slowly, and though the prisoners seemed to be allowed
considerable liberty, they soon found that it was only apparent. Once
Tom walked some distance from that portion of the deck where he and the
others had been told to remain. A sailor with a gun at once ordered him
back. Nor could they approach the rails without being directed, harshly
enough at times, to move back amidships.

As night approached the gold-seekers were on the alert for any chance
that might offer to slip away, or even attack their guard, but the
number of Brazilians around them was doubled in the evening, and after
supper, which was served to them on deck by the light of swinging
lanterns, they were taken below and locked in a stuffy cabin. They
looked helplessly at each other.

"Don't give up," advised Captain Weston. "It's a long night. We may be
able to get out of here."

But this hope was in vain. Several times he and Tom, thinking the
guards outside the cabin were asleep, tried to force the lock of the
door with their pocket-knives, which had not been taken from them. But
one of the sailors was aroused each time by the noise, and looked in
through a barred window, so they had to give it up. Slowly the night
passed, and morning found the prisoners pale, tired and discouraged.
They were brought up on deck again, for which they were thankful, as in
that tropical climate it was stifling below.

During the day they saw Admiral Fanchetti and several of his officers
pay a visit to the submarine. They went below through the opened
conning tower, and were gone some time.

"I hope they don't disturb any of the machinery," remarked Mr. Swift.
"That could easily do great damage."

Admiral Fanchetti seemed much pleased with himself when he returned
from his visit to the submarine.

"You have a fine craft," he said to the prisoners. "Or, rather, you had
one. My government now owns it. It seems a pity to shoot such good boat
builders, but you are too dangerous to be allowed to go."

If there had been any doubt in the minds of Tom and his friends that
the sentence of the court-martial was only for effect, it was dispelled
that day. A firing squad was told off in plain view of them, and the
men were put through their evolutions by Lieutenant Drascalo, who had
them load, aim and fire blank cartridges at an imaginary line of
prisoners. Tom could not repress a shudder as he noted the leveled
rifles, and saw the fire and smoke spurt from the muzzles.

"Thus we shall do to you at sunrise to-morrow," said the lieutenant,
grinning, as he once more had his men practice their grim work.

It seemed hotter than ever that day. The sun was fairly broiling, and
there was a curious haziness and stillness to the air. It was noticed
that the sailors on the San Paulo were busy making fast all loose
articles on deck with extra lashings, and hatch coverings were doubly
secured.

"What do you suppose they are up to?" asked Tom of Captain Weston.

"I think it is coming on to blow," he replied, "and they don't want to
be caught napping. They have fearful storms down in this region at this
season of the year, and I think one is about due."

"I hope it doesn't wreck the submarine," spoke Mr. Swift.  "They ought
to close the hatch of the conning tower, for it won't take much of a
sea to make her ship considerable water."

Admiral Fanchetti had thought of this, however, and as the afternoon
wore away and the storm signs multiplied, he sent word to close the
submarine. He left a few sailors aboard inside on guard.

"It's too hot to eat," observed Tom, when their supper had been brought
to them, and the others felt the same way about it. They managed to
drink some cocoanut milk, prepared in a palatable fashion by the
natives of the island, and then, much to their disgust, they were taken
below again and locked in the cabin.

"Whew! But it certainly is hot!" exclaimed Mr. Damon as he sat down on
a couch and fanned himself. "This is awful!"

"Yes, something is going to happen pretty soon," observed Captain
Weston. "The storm will break shortly, I think."

They sat languidly about the cabin. It was so oppressive that even the
thought of the doom that awaited them in the morning could hardly seem
worse than the terrible heat. They could hear movements going on about
the ship, movements which indicated that preparations were being made
for something unusual. There was a rattling of a chain through a hawse
hole, and Captain Weston remarked:

"They're putting down another anchor. Admiral Fanchetti had better get
away from the island, though, unless he wants to be wrecked. He'll be
blown ashore in less than no time. No cable or chain will hold in such
storms as they have here."

There came a period of silence, which was suddenly broken by a howl as
of some wild beast.

"What's that?" cried Tom, springing up from where he was stretched out
on the cabin floor.

"Only the wind," replied the captain. "The storm has arrived."

The howling kept up, and soon the ship began to rock. The wind
increased, and a little later there could be heard, through an opened
port in the prisoners' cabin, the dash of rain.

"It's a regular hurricane!" exclaimed the captain. "I wonder if the
cables will hold?"

"What about the submarine?" asked Mr. Swift anxiously.

"I haven't much fear for her. She lies so low in the water that the
wind can't get much hold on her. I don't believe she'll drag her
anchor."

Once more came a fierce burst of wind, and a dash of rain, and then,
suddenly above the outburst of the elements, there sounded a crash on
deck. It was followed by excited cries.

"Something's happened!" yelled Tom. The prisoners gathered in a
frightened group in the middle of the cabin. The cries were repeated,
and then came a rush of feet just outside the cabin door.

"Our guards! They're leaving!" shouted Tom.

"Right!" exclaimed Captain Weston. "Now's our chance! Come on! If we're
going to escape we must do it while the storm is at its height, and all
is in confusion. Come on!"

Tom tried the door. It was locked.

"One side!" shouted the captain, and this time he did not pause to say
"by your leave." He came at the portal on the run, and his shoulder
struck it squarely. There was a splintering and crashing of wood, and
the door was burst open.

"Follow me!" cried the valiant sailor, and Tom and the others rushed
after him. They could hear the wind howling more loudly than ever, and
as they reached the deck the rain dashed into their faces with such
violence that they could hardly see. But they were aware that something
had occurred.  By the light of several lanterns swaying in the terrific
blast they saw that one of the auxiliary masts had broken off near the
deck.

It had fallen against the chart house, smashing it, and a number of
sailors were laboring to clear away the wreckage.

"Fortune favors us!" cried Captain Weston. "Come on! Make for the small
boat. It's near the side ladder. We'll lower the boat and pull to the
submarine."

There came a flash of lightning, and in its glare Tom saw something
that caused him to cry out.

"Look!" he shouted. "The submarine. She's dragged her anchors!"

The Advance was much closer to the warship than she had been that
afternoon. Captain Weston looked over the side.

"It's the San Paulo that's dragging her anchors, not the submarine!" he
shouted. "We're bearing down on her! We must act quickly. Come on,
we'll lower the boat!"

In the rush of wind and the dash of rain the prisoners crowded to the
accommodation companion ladder, which was still over the side of the
big ship. No one seemed to be noticing them, for Admiral Fanchetti was
on the bridge, yelling orders for the clearing away of the wreckage.
But Lieutenant Drascalo, coming up from below at that moment, caught
sight of the fleeing ones. Drawing his sword, he rushed at them,
shouting:

"The prisoners! The prisoners! They are escaping!"

Captain Weston leaped toward the lieutenant.

"Look out for his sword!" cried Tom. But the doughty sailor did not
fear the weapon. Catching up a coil of rope, he cast it at the
lieutenant. It struck him in the chest, and he staggered back, lowering
his sword.

Captain Weston leaped forward, and with a terrific blow sent Lieutenant
Drascalo to the deck.

"There!" cried the sailor. "I guess you won't yell 'Silenceo!' for a
while now."

There was a rush of Brazilians toward the group of prisoners. Tom
caught one with a blow on the chin, and felled him, while Captain
Weston disposed of two more, and Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon one each. The
savage fighting of the Americans was too much for the foreigners, and
they drew back.

"Come on!" cried Captain Weston again. "The storm is getting worse. The
warship will crash into the submarine in a few minutes. Her anchors
aren't holding. I didn't think they would."

He made a dash for the ladder, and a glance showed him that the small
boat was in the water at the foot of it. The craft had not been hoisted
on the davits.

"Luck's with us at last!" cried Tom, seeing it also.  "Shall I help
you, dad?"

"No; I think I'm all right. Go ahead."

There came such a gust of wind that the San Paulo was heeled over, and
the wreck of the mast, rolling about, crashed into the side of a deck
house, splintering it. A crowd of sailors, led by Admiral Fanchetti,
who were again rushing on the escaping prisoners, had to leap back out
of the way of the rolling mast.

"Catch them! Don't let them get away!" begged the commander, but the
sailors evidently had no desire to close in with the Americans.

Through the rush of wind and rain Tom and his friends staggered down
the ladder. It was hard work to maintain one's footing, but they
managed it. On account of the high side of the ship the water was
comparatively calm under her lee, and, though the small boat was
bobbing about, they got aboard. The oars were in place, and in another
moment they had shoved off from the landing stage which formed the foot
of the accommodation ladder.

"Now for the Advance!" murmured Captain Weston.

"Come back! Come back, dogs of Americans!" cried a voice at the rail
over their heads, and looking up, Tom saw Lieutenant Drascalo. He had
snatched a carbine from a marine, and was pointing it at the recent
prisoners. He fired, the flash of the gun and a dazzling chain of
lightning coming together. The thunder swallowed up the report of the
carbine, but the bullet whistled uncomfortable close to Tom's head. The
blackness that followed the lightning shut out the view of everything
for a few seconds, and when the next flash came the adventurers saw
that they were close to their submarine.

A fusillade of shots sounded from the deck of the warship, but as the
marines were poor marksmen at best, and as the swaying of the ship
disconcerted them, our friends were in little danger.

There was quite a sea once they were beyond the protection of the side
of the warship, but Captain Weston, who was rowing, knew how to manage
a boat skillfully, and he soon had the craft alongside the bobbing
submarine.

"Get aboard, now, quick!" he cried.

They leaped to the small deck, casting the rowboat adrift.  It was the
work of but a moment to open the conning tower.  As they started to
descend they were met by several Brazilians coming up.

"Overboard with 'em!" yelled the captain. "Let them swim ashore or to
their ship!"

With almost superhuman strength he tossed one big sailor from the small
deck. Another showed fight, but he went to join his companion in the
swirling water. A man rushed at Tom, seeking the while to draw his
sword, but the young inventor, with a neat left-hander, sent him to
join the other two, and the remainder did not wait to try conclusions.
They leaped for their lives, and soon all could be seen, in the
frequent lightning flashes, swimming toward the warship which was now
closer than ever to the submarine.

"Get inside and we'll sink below the surface!" called Tom.  "Then we
don't care what happens."

They closed the steel door of the conning tower. As they did so they
heard the patter of bullets from carbines fired from the San Paulo.
Then came a violent tossing of the Advance; the waves were becoming
higher as they caught the full force of the hurricane. It took but an
instant to sever, from within, the cable attached to the anchor, which
was one belonging to the warship. The Advance began drifting.

"Open the tanks, Mr. Sharp!" cried Tom. "Captain Weston and I will
steer. Once below we'll start the engines."

Amid a crash of thunder and dazzling flashes of lightning, the
submarine began to sink. Tom, in the conning tower had a sight of the
San Paulo as it drifted nearer and nearer under the influence of the
mighty wind. As one bright flash came he saw Admiral Fanchetti and
Lieutenant Drascalo leaning over the rail and gazing at the Advance.

A moment later the view faded from sight as the submarine sank below
the surface of the troubled sea. She was tossed about for some time
until deep enough to escape the surface motion. Waiting until she was
far enough down so that her lights would not offer a mark for the guns
of the warship, the electrics were switched on.

"We're safe now!" cried Tom, helping his father to his cabin. "They've
got too much to attend to themselves to follow us now, even if they
could. Shall we go ahead, Captain Weston?"

"I think so, yes, if I may be allowed to express my opinion," was the
mild reply, in strange contrast to the strenuous work in which the
captain had just been engaged.

Tom signaled to Mr. Sharp in the engine-room, and in a few seconds the
Advance was speeding away from the island and the hostile vessel. Nor,
deep as she was now, was there any sign of the hurricane. In the
peaceful depths she was once more speeding toward the sunken treasure.




Chapter Twenty-Two

At the Wreck


"Well," remarked Mr. Damon, as the submarine hurled herself forward
through the ocean, "I guess that firing party will have something else
to do to-morrow morning besides aiming those rifles at us."

"Yes, indeed," agreed Tom. "They'll be lucky if they save their ship.
My, how that wind did blow!"

"You're right," put in Captain Weston. "When they get a hurricane down
in this region it's no cat's paw. But they were a mighty careless lot
of sailors. The idea of leaving the ladder over the side, and the boat
in the water."

"It was a good thing for us, though," was Tom's opinion.

"Indeed it was," came from the captain. "But as long as we are safe now
I think we'd better take a look about the craft to see if those chaps
did any damage. They can't have done much, though, or she wouldn't be
running so smoothly.  Suppose you go take a look, Tom, and ask your
father and Mr. Sharp what they think. I'll steer for a while, until we
get well away from the island."

The young inventor found his father and the balloonist busy in the
engine-room. Mr. Swift had already begun an inspection of the
machinery, and so far found that it had not been injured. A further
inspection showed that no damage had been done by the foreign guard
that had been in temporary possession of the Advance, though the
sailors had made free in the cabins, and had broken into the food
lockers, helping themselves plentifully. But there was still enough for
the gold-seekers.

"You'd never know there was a storm raging up above," observed Tom as
he rejoined Captain Weston in the lower pilot house, where he was
managing the craft. "It's as still and peaceful here as one could wish."

"Yes, the extreme depths are seldom disturbed by a surface storm. But
we are over a mile deep now. I sent her down a little while you were
gone, as I think she rides a little more steadily."

All that night they speeded forward, and the next day, rising to the
surface to take an observation, they found no traces of the storm,
which had blown itself out. They were several hundred miles away from
the hostile warship, and there was not a vessel in sight on the broad
expanse of blue ocean.

The air tanks were refilled, and after sailing along on the surface for
an hour or two, the submarine was again sent below, as Captain Weston
sighted through his telescope the smoke of a distant steamer.

"As long as it isn't the Wonder, we're all right," said Tom. "Still, we
don't want to answer a lot of questions about ourselves and our object."

"No. I fancy the Wonder will give up the search," remarked the captain,
as the Advance was sinking to the depths.

"We must be getting pretty near to the end of our search ourselves,"
ventured the young inventor.

"We are within five hundred miles of the intersection of the
forty-fifth parallel and the twenty-seventh meridian, east from
Washington," said the captain. "That's as near as I could locate the
wreck. Once we reach that point we will have to search about under
water, for I don't fancy the other divers left any buoys to mark the
spot."

It was two days later, after uneventful sailing, partly on the surface,
and partly submerged, that Captain Weston, taking a noon observation,
announced:

"Well, we're here!"

"Do you mean at the wreck?" asked Mr. Swift eagerly.

"We're at the place where she is supposed to lie, in about two miles of
water," replied the captain. "We are quite a distance off the coast of
Uruguay, about opposite the harbor of Rio de La Plata. From now on we
shall have to nose about under water, and trust to luck."

With her air tanks filled to their capacity, and Tom having seen that
the oxygen machine and other apparatus was in perfect working order,
the submarine was sent below on her search. Though they were in the
neighborhood of the wreck, the adventurers might still have to do
considerable searching before locating it. Lower and lower they sank
into the depths of the sea, down and down, until they were deeper than
they had ever gone before. The pressure was tremendous, but the steel
sides of the Advance withstood it.

Then began a search that lasted nearly a week. Back and forth they
cruised, around in great circles, with the powerful searchlight focused
to disclose the sunken treasure ship. Once Tom, who was observing the
path of light in the depths from the conning tower, thought he had seen
the remains of the Boldero, for a misty shape loomed up in front of the
submarine, and he signaled for a quick stop. It was a wreck, but it had
been on the ocean bed for a score of years, and only a few timbers
remained of what had been a great ship. Much disappointed, Tom rang for
full speed ahead again, and the current was sent into the great
electric plates that pulled and pushed the submarine forward.

For two days more nothing happened. They searched around under the
green waters, on the alert for the first sign, but they saw nothing.
Great fish swam about them, sometimes racing with the Advance. The
adventurers beheld great ocean caverns, and skirted immense rocks,
where dwelt monsters of the deep. Once a great octopus tried to do
battle with the submarine and crush it in its snaky arms, but Tom saw
the great white body, with saucer-shaped eyes, in the path of light and
rammed him with the steel point. The creature died after a struggle.

They were beginning to despair when a full week had passed and they
were seemingly as far from the wreck as ever. They went to the surface
to enable Captain Weston to take another observation. It only confirmed
the other, and showed that they were in the right vicinity. But it was
like looking for a needle in a haystack, almost, to find the sunken ship
in that depth of water.

"Well, we'll try again," said Mr. Swift, as they sank once more beneath
the surface.

It was toward evening, on the second day after this, that Tom, who was
on duty in the conning tower, saw a black shape looming up in front of
the submarine, the searchlight revealing it to him far enough away so
that he could steer to avoid it. He thought at first that it was a
great rock, for they were moving along near the bottom, but the
peculiar shape of it soon convinced him that this could not be. It came
more plainly into view as the submarine approached it more slowly, then
suddenly, out of the depths in the illumination from the searchlight,
the young inventor saw the steel sides of a steamer. His heart gave a
great thump, but he would not call out yet, fearing that it might be
some other vessel than the one containing the treasure.

He steered the Advance so as to circle it. As he swept past the bows he
saw in big letters near the sharp prow the word, Boldero.

"The wreck! The wreck!" he cried, his voice ringing through the craft
from end to end. "We've found the wreck at last!"

"Are you sure?" cried his father, hurrying to his son, Captain Weston
following.

"Positive," answered the lad. The submarine was slowing up now, and Tom
sent her around on the other side. They had a good view of the sunken
ship. It seemed to be intact, no gaping holes in her sides, for only
her plates had started, allowing her to sink gradually.

"At last," murmured Mr. Swift. "Can it be possible we are about to get
the treasure?"

"That's the Boldero, all right," affirmed Captain Weston.  "I recognize
her, even if the name wasn't on her bow. Go right down on the bottom,
Tom, and we'll get out the diving suits and make an examination."

The submarine settled to the ocean bed. Tom glanced at the depth gage.
It showed over two miles and a half. Would they be able to venture out
into water of such enormous pressure in the comparatively frail diving
suits, and wrest the gold from the wreck? It was a serious question.

The Advance came to a stop. In front of her loomed the great bulk of
the Boldero, vague and shadowy in the flickering gleam of the
searchlight. As the gold-seekers looked at her through the bull's-eyes
of the conning tower, several great forms emerged from beneath the
wreck's bows.

"Deep-water sharks!" exclaimed  Captain Weston, "and monsters, too. But
they can't bother us. Now to get out the gold!"




Chapter Twenty-Three

Attacked by Sharks


For a few minutes after reaching the wreck, which had so occupied their
thoughts for the past weeks, the adventurers did nothing but gaze at it
from the ports of the submarine.  The appearance of the deep-water
sharks gave them no concern, for they did not imagine the ugly
creatures would attack them. The treasure-seekers were more engrossed
with the problem of getting out the gold.

"How are we going to get at it?" asked Tom, as he looked at the high
sides of the sunken ship, which towered well above the comparatively
small Advance.

"Why, just go in and get it," suggested Mr. Damon. "Where is gold in a
cargo usually kept, Captain Weston? You ought to know, I should think.
Bless my pocketbook!"

"Well, I should say that in this case the bullion would be kept in a
safe in the captain's cabin," replied the sailor.  "Or, if not there,
in some after part of the vessel, away from where the crew is
quartered. But it is going to be quite a problem to get at it. We can't
climb the sides of the wreck, and it will be impossible to lower her
ladder over the side. However, I think we had better get into the
diving suits and take a closer look. We can walk around her."

"That's my idea," put in Mr. Sharp. "But who will go, and who will stay
with the ship?"

"I think Tom and Captain Weston had better go," suggested Mr. Swift.
"Then, in case anything happens, Mr. Sharp, you and I will be on board
to manage matters."

"You don't think anything will happen, do you, dad?" asked his son with
a laugh, but it was not an easy one, for the lad was thinking of the
shadowy forms of the ugly sharks.

"Oh, no, but it's best to be prepared," answered his father.

The captain and the young inventor lost no time in donning the diving
suits. They each took a heavy metal bar, pointed at one end, to use in
assisting them to walk on the bed of the ocean, and as a protection in
case the sharks might attack them. Entering the diving chamber, they
were shut in, and then water was admitted until the pressure was seen,
by gauges, to be the same as that outside the submarine. Then the
sliding steel door was opened. At first Tom and the captain could
barely move, so great was the pressure of water on their bodies. They
would have been crushed but for the protection afforded by the strong
diving suits.

In a few minutes they became used to it, and stepped out on the floor
of the ocean. They could not, of course, speak to each other, but Tom
looked through the glass eyes of his helmet at the captain, and the
latter motioned for the lad to follow. The two divers could breathe
perfectly, and by means of small, but powerful lights on the helmets,
the way was lighted for them as they advanced.

Slowly they approached the wreck, and began a circuit of her. They
could see several places where the pressure of the water, and the
strain of the storm in which she had foundered, had opened the plates
of the ship, but in no case were the openings large enough to admit a
person.  Captain Weston put his steel bar in one crack, and tried to
pry it farther open, but his strength was not equal to the task. He
made some peculiar motions, but Tom could not understand them.

They looked for some means by which they could mount to the decks of
the Boldero, but none was visible. It was like trying to scale a
fifty-foot smooth steel wall. There was no place for a foothold. Again
the sailor made some peculiar motions, and the lad puzzled over them.
They had gone nearly around the wreck now, and as yet had seen no way
in which to get at the gold. As they passed around the bow, which was
in a deep shadow from a great rock, they caught sight of the submarine
lying a short distance away. Light streamed from many bull's-eyes, and
Tom felt a sense of security as he looked at her, for it was lonesome
enough in that great depth of water, unable to speak to his companion,
who was a few feet in advance.

Suddenly there was a swirling of the water, and Tom was nearly thrown
off his feet by the rush of some great body. A long, black shadow
passed over his head, and an instant later he saw the form of a great
shark launched at Captain Weston. The lad involuntarily cried in alarm,
but the result was surprising. He was nearly deafened by his own voice,
confined as the sound was in the helmet he wore. But the sailor, too,
had felt the movement of the water, and turned just in time. He thrust
upward with his pointed bar. But he missed the stroke, and Tom, a
moment later, saw the great fish turn over so that its mouth, which is
far underneath its snout, could take in the queer shape which the shark
evidently thought was a choice morsel. The big fish did actually get
the helmet of Captain Weston inside its jaws, but probably it would
have found it impossible to crush the strong steel. Still it might have
sprung the joints, and water would have entered, which would have been
as fatal as though the sailor had been swallowed by the shark. Tom
realized this and, moving as fast as he could through the water, he
came up behind the monster and drove his steel bar deep into it.

The sea was crimsoned with blood, and the savage creature, opening its
mouth, let go of the captain. It turned on Tom, who again harpooned it.
Then the fish darted off and began a wild flurry, for it was dying. The
rush of water nearly threw Tom off his feet, but he managed to make his
way over to his friend, and assist him to rise. A confident look from
the sailor showed the lad that Captain Weston was uninjured, though he
must have been frightened. As the two turned to make their way back to
the submarine, the waters about them seemed alive with the horrible
monsters.

It needed but a glance to show what they were, Sharks!  Scores of them,
long, black ones, with their ugly, undershot mouths. They had been
attracted by the blood of the one Tom had killed, but there was not a
meal for all of them off the dying creature, and the great fish might
turn on the young inventor and his companion.

The two shrank closer toward the wreck. They might get under the prow
of that and be safe. But even as they started to move, several of the
sea wolves darted quickly at them.  Tom glanced at the captain. What
could they do? Strong as were the diving suits, a combined attack by
the sharks, with their powerful jaws, would do untold damage.

At that moment there seemed some movement on board the submarine. Tom
could see his father looking from the conning tower, and the aged
inventor seemed to be making some motions. Then Tom understood. Mr.
Swift was directing his son and Captain Weston to crouch down. The lad
did so, pulling the sailor after him. Then Tom saw the bow electric gun
run out, and aimed at the mass of sharks, most of whom were congregated
about the dead one. Into the midst of the monsters was fired a number
of small projectiles, which could be used in the electric cannon in
place of the solid shot. Once more the waters were red with blood, and
those sharks which were not killed swirled off. Tom and Captain Weston
were saved. They were soon inside the submarine again, telling their
thrilling story.

"It's lucky you saw us, dad," remarked the lad, blushing at the praise
Mr. Damon bestowed on him for killing the monster which had attacked
the captain.

"Oh, I was on the lookout," said the inventor. "But what about getting
into the wreck?"

"I think the only way we can do it will be to ram a hole in her side,"
said Captain Weston. "That was what I tried to tell Tom by motions, but
he didn't seem to understand me."

"No," replied the lad, who was still a little nervous from his recent
experience. "I thought you meant for us to turn it over, bottom side
up," and he laughed.

"Bless my gizzard!  Just like a shark," commented Mr. Damon.

"Please don't mention them," begged Tom. "I hope we don't see any more
of them."

"Oh, I fancy they have been driven far enough away from this
neighborhood now," commented the captain. "But now about the wreck. We
may be able to approach it from above.  Suppose we try to lower the
submarine on it? That will save ripping it open."

This was tried a little later, but would not work. There were strong
currents sweeping over the top of the Boldero, caused by a submerged
reef near which she had settled. It was a delicate task to sink the
submarine on her decks, and with the deep waters swirling about was
found to be impossible, even with the use of the electric plates and
the auxiliary screws. Once more the Advance settled to the ocean bed,
near the wreck.

"Well, what's to be done?" asked Tom, as he looked at the high steel
sides.

"Ram her, tear a hole, and then use dynamite," decided Captain Weston
promptly. "You have some explosive, haven't you, Mr. Swift?"

"Oh, yes. I came prepared for emergencies."

"Then we'll blow up the wreck and get at the gold."




Chapter Twenty-Four

Ramming the Wreck


Fitted with a long, sharp steel ram in front, the Advance was
peculiarly adapted for this sort of work. In designing the ship this
ram was calculated to be used against hostile vessels in war time, for
the submarine was at first, as we know, destined for a Government boat.
Now the ram was to serve a good turn.

To make sure that the attempt would be a success, the machinery of the
craft was carefully gone over. It was found to be in perfect order,
save for a few adjustments which were needed. Then, as it was night,
though there was no difference in the appearance of things below the
surface, it was decided to turn in, and begin work in the morning. Nor
did the gold-seekers go to the surface, for they feared they might
encounter a storm.

"We had trouble enough locating the wreck," said Captain Weston, "and
if we go up we may be blown off our course. We have air enough to stay
below, haven't we, Tom?"

"Plenty," answered the lad, looking at the gages.

After a hearty breakfast the next morning, the submarine crew got ready
for their hard task. The craft was backed away as far as was practical,
and then, running at full speed, she rammed the wreck. The shock was
terrific, and at first it was feared some damage had been done to the
Advance, but she stood the strain.

"Did we open up much of a hole?" anxiously asked Mr. Swift.

"Pretty good," replied Tom, observing it through the conning tower
bull's-eyes, when the submarine had backed off again. "Let's give her
another."

Once more the great steel ram hit into the side of the Boldero, and
again the submarine shivered from the shock.  But there was a bigger
hole in the wreck now, and after Captain Weston had viewed it he
decided it was large enough to allow a person to enter and place a
charge of dynamite so that the treasure ship would be broken up.

Tom and the captain placed the explosive. Then the Advance was
withdrawn to a safe distance. There was a dull rumble, a great swirling
of the water, which was made murky; but when it cleared, and the
submarine went back, it was seen that the wreck was effectively broken
up. It was in two parts, each one easy of access.

"That's the stuff!" cried Tom. "Now to get at the gold!"

"Yes, get out the diving suits," added Mr. Damon. "Bless my
watch-charm, I think I'll chance it in one myself! Do you think the
sharks are all gone, Captain Weston?"

"I think so."

In a short time Tom, the captain, Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon were attired
in the diving suits, Mr. Swift not caring to venture into such a great
depth of water. Besides, it was necessary for at least one person to
remain in the submarine to operate the diving chamber.

Walking slowly along the bottom of the sea the four gold-seekers
approached the wreck. They looked on all sides for a sight of the
sharks, but the monster fish seemed to have deserted that part of the
ocean. Tom was the first to reach the now disrupted steamer. He found
he could easily climb up, for boxes and barrels from the cargo holds
were scattered all about by the explosion. Captain Weston soon joined
the lad. The sailor motioned Tom to follow him, and being more familiar
with ocean craft the captain was permitted to take the lead. He headed
aft, seeking to locate the captain's cabin. Nor was he long in finding
it. He motioned for the others to enter, that the combined illumination
of the lamps in their helmets would make the place bright enough so a
search could be made for the gold.  Tom suddenly seized the arm of the
captain, and pointed to one corner of the cabin. There stood a small
safe, and at the sight of it Captain Weston moved toward it. The door
was not locked, probably having been left open when the ship was
deserted. Swinging it back the interior was revealed.

It was empty. There was no gold bullion in it.

There was no mistaking the dejected air of Captain Weston.  The others
shared his feelings, but though they all felt like voicing their
disappointment, not a word could be spoken. Mr. Sharp, by vigorous
motions, indicated to his companions to seek further.

They did so, spending all the rest of the day in the wreck, save for a
short interval for dinner. But no gold rewarded their search.

Tom, late that afternoon, wandered away from the others, and found
himself in the captain's cabin again, with the empty safe showing dimly
in the water that was all about.

"Hang it all!" thought the lad, "we've had all our trouble for nothing!
They must have taken the gold with them."

Idly he raised his steel bar, and struck it against the partition back
of the safe. To his astonishment the partition seemed to fall inward,
revealing a secret compartment. The lad leaned forward to bring the
light for his helmet to play on the recess. He saw a number of boxes,
piled one upon the other. He had accidentally touched a hidden spring
and opened a secret receptacle. But what did it contain?

Tom reached in and tried to lift one of the boxes. He found it beyond
his strength. Trembling from excitement, he went in search of the
others. He found them delving in the after part of the wreck, but by
motions our hero caused them to follow him. Captain Weston showed the
excitement he felt as soon as he caught sight of the boxes. He and Mr.
Sharp lifted one out, and placed it on the cabin floor. They pried off
the top with their bars.

There, packed in layers, were small yellow bars; dull, gleaming, yellow
bars! It needed but a glance to show that they were gold bullion. Tom
had found the treasure. The lad tried to dance around there in the
cabin of the wreck, nearly three miles below the surface of the ocean,
but the pressure of water was too much for him. Their trip had been
successful.




Chapter Twenty-Five

Home With the Gold


There was no time to be lost. They were in a treacherous part of the
ocean, and strong currents might at any time further break up the
wreck, so that they could not come at the gold. It was decided, by
means of motions, to at once transfer the treasure to the submarine. As
the boxes were too heavy to carry easily, especially as two men, who
were required to lift one, could not walk together in the uncertain
footing afforded by the wreck, another plan was adopted. The boxes were
opened and the bars, a few at a time, were dropped on a firm, sandy
place at the side of the wreck. Tom and Captain Weston did this work,
while Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon carried the bullion to the diving chamber
of the Advance. They put the yellow bars inside, and when quite a
number had been thus shifted, Mr. Swift, closing the chamber, pumped
the water out and removed the gold. Then he opened the chamber to the
divers again, and the process was repeated, until all the bullion had
been secured.

Tom would have been glad to make a further examination of the wreck,
for he thought he could get some of the rifles the ship carried, but
Captain Weston signed to him not to attempt this.

The lad went to the pilot house, while his father and Mr. Sharp took
their places in the engine-room. The gold had been safely stowed in Mr.
Swift's cabin.

Tom took a last look at the wreck before he gave the starting signal.
As he gazed at the bent and twisted mass of steel that had once been a
great ship, he saw something long, black and shadowy moving around from
the other side, coming across the bows.

"There's another big shark," he observed to Captain Weston. "They're
coming back after us."

The captain did not speak. He was staring at the dark form. Suddenly,
from what seemed the pointed nose of it, there gleamed a light, as from
some great eye.

"Look at that!" cried Tom. "That's no shark!"

"If you want my opinion," remarked the sailor, "I should say it was the
other submarine--that of Berg and his friends--the Wonder. They've
managed to fix up their craft and are after the gold."

"But they're too late!" cried Tom excitedly. "Let's tell them so."

"No," advised the captain. "We don't want any trouble with them."

Mr. Swift came forward to see why his son had not given the signal to
start. He was shown the other submarine, for now that the Wonder had
turned on several searchlights, there was no doubt as to the identity
of the craft.

"Let's get away unobserved if we can," he suggested. "We have had
trouble enough."

It was easy to do this, as the Advance was hidden behind the wreck, and
her lights were glowing but dimly. Then, too, those in the other
submarine were so excited over the finding of what they supposed was
the wreck containing the treasure, that they paid little attention to
anything else.

"I wonder how they'll feel when they find the gold gone?" asked Tom as
he pulled the lever starting the pumps.

"Well, we may have a chance to learn, when we get back to
civilization," remarked the captain.

The surface was soon reached, and then, under fair skies, and on a calm
sea, the voyage home was begun. Part of the time the Advance sailed on
the top, and part of the time submerged.

They met with but a single accident, and that was when the forward
electrical plate broke. But with the aft one still in commission, and
the auxiliary screws, they made good time. Just before reaching home
they settled down to the bottom and donned the diving suits again, even
Mr. Swift taking his turn. Mr. Damon caught some large lobsters, of
which he was very fond, or, rather, to be more correct, the lobsters
caught him. When he entered the diving chamber there were four fine
ones clinging to different parts of his diving suit. Some of them were
served for dinner.

The adventurers safely reached the New Jersey coast, and the submarine
was docked. Mr. Swift at once communicated with the proper authorities
concerning the recovery of the gold. He offered to divide with the
actual owners, after he and his friends had been paid for their
services, but as the revolutionary party to whom the bullion was
intended had gone out of existence, there was no one to officially
claim the treasure, so it all went to Tom and his friends, who made an
equitable distribution of it. The young inventor did not forget to buy
Mrs. Baggert a fine diamond ring, as he had promised.

As for Berg and his employers, they were, it was learned later, greatly
chagrined at finding the wreck valueless.  They tried to make trouble
for Tom and his father, but were not successful.

A few days after arriving at the seacoast cottage, Tom, his father and
Mr. Damon went to Shopton in the airship.  Captain Weston, Garret
Jackson and Mr Sharp remained behind in charge of the submarine. It was
decided that the Swifts would keep the craft and not sell it to the
Government, as Tom said they might want to go after more treasure some
day.

"I must first deposit this gold," said Mr. Swift as the airship landed
in front of the shed at his home. "It won't do to keep it in the house
over night, even if the Happy Harry gang is in jail."

Tom helped him take it to the bank. As they were making perhaps the
largest single deposit ever put in the institution, Ned Newton came out.

"Well, Tom," he cried to his chum, "it seems that you are never going
to stop doing things. You've conquered the air, the earth and the
water."

"What have you been doing while I've been under water, Ned?" asked the
young inventor.

"Oh, the same old thing. Running errands and doing all sorts of work in
the bank."

Tom had a sudden idea. He whispered to his father and Mr. Swift nodded.
A little later he was closeted with Mr. Prendergast, the bank
president. It was not long before Ned and Tom were called in.

"I have some good news for you, Ned," said Mr. Prendergast, while Tom
smiled. "Mr. Swift er--ahem--one of our largest depositors, has spoken
to me about you, Ned. I find that you have been very faithful. You are
hereby appointed assistant cashier, and of course you will get a much
larger salary."

Ned could hardly believe it, but he knew then what Tom had whispered to
Mr. Swift. The wishes of a depositor who brings much gold bullion to a
bank can hardly be ignored.

"Come on out and have some soda," invited Tom, and when Ned looked
inquiringly at the president, the latter nodded an assent.

As the two lads were crossing the street to a drug store, something
whizzed past them, nearly running them down.

"What sort of an auto was that?" cried Tom.

"That? Oh, that was Andy Foger's new car," answered Ned.  "He's been
breaking the speed laws every day lately, but no one seems to bother
him. It's because his father is rich, I suppose. Andy says he has the
fastest car ever built."

"He has, eh?" remarked Tom, while a curious look came into his eyes.
"Well, maybe I can build one that will beat his."

And whether the young inventor did or not you can learn by reading the
fifth volume of this series, to be called "Tom Swift and His Electric
Runabout; Or, The Speediest Car on the Road."

"Well, Tom, I certainly appreciate what you did for me in getting me a
better position," remarked Ned as they left the drug store. "I was
beginning to think I'd never get promoted. Say, have you anything to do
this evening? If you haven't, I wish you'd come over to my house. I've
got a lot of pictures I took while you were away."

"Sorry, but I can't," replied Tom.

"Why, are you going to build another airship or submarine?"

"No, but I'm going to see-- Oh, what do you want to know for, anyhow?"
demanded the young inventor with a blush.  "Can't a fellow go see a
girl without being cross-questioned?"

"Oh, of course," replied Ned with a laugh. "Give Miss Nestor my
regards," and at this Tom blushed still more. But, as he said, that was
his own affair.

CHAPTER I

TOM HOPES FOR A PRIZE


"Father," exclaimed Tom Swift, looking up from a paper he was reading,
"I think I can win that prize!"

"What prize is that?" inquired the aged inventor, gazing away from a
drawing of a complicated machine, and pausing in his task of making
some intricate calculations. "You don't mean to say, Tom, that you're
going to have a try for a government prize for a submarine, after all."

"No, not a submarine prize, dad," and the youth laughed.  "Though our
Advance would take the prize away from almost any other under-water
boat, I imagine. No, it's another prize I'm thinking about."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, I see by this paper that the Touring Club of America has offered
three thousand dollars for the speediest electric car.  The tests are
to come off this fall, on a new and specially built track on Long
Island, and it's to be an endurance contest for twenty-four hours, or a
race for distance, they haven't yet decided. But I'm going to have a
try for it, dad, and, besides winning the prize, I think I'll take Andy
Foger down a peg.

"What's Andy been doing now?"

"Oh, nothing more than usual. He's always mean, and looking for a
chance to make trouble for me, but I didn't refer to anything special.
He has a new auto, you know, and he boasts that it's the fastest one in
this country. I'll show him that it isn't, for I'm going to win this
prize with the speediest car on the road."

"But, Tom, you haven't any automobile, you know," and Mr. Swift looked
anxiously at his son, who was smiling confidently. "You can't be going
to make your motor-cycle into an auto; are you?"

"No, dad."

"Then how are you going to take part in the prize contest?  Besides,
electric cars, as far as I know, aren't specially speedy."

"I know it, and one reason why this club has arranged the contest is to
improve the quality of electric automobiles. I'm going to build an
electric runabout, dad."

"An electric runabout?  But it will have to be operated with a storage
battery, Tom, and you haven't--"

"I guess you're going to say I haven't any storage battery, dad,"
interrupted Mr. Swift's son. "Well, I haven't yet, but I'm going to
have one. I've been working on--"

"Oh, ho!" exclaimed the aged inventor with a laugh. "So that's what
you've been tinkering over these last few weeks, eh, Tom?  I suspected
it was some new invention, but I didn't suppose it was that. Well, how
are you coming on with it?"

"Pretty good, I think. I've got a new idea for a battery, and I made an
experimental one. I gave it some pretty severe tests, and it worked
fine."

"But you haven't tried it out in a car yet, over rough roads, and under
severe conditions have you?"

"No, I haven't had a chance. In fact, when I invented the battery I had
no idea of using it on a car I thought it might answer for commercial
purposes, or for storing a current generated by windmills. But when I
read that account in the papers of the Touring Club, offering a prize
for the best electric car, it occurred to me that I might put my
battery into an auto, and win."

"Hum," remarked Mr. Swift musingly. "I don't take much stock in
electric autos, Tom. Gasolene seems to be the best, or perhaps steam,
generated by gasolene. I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.  All the
electric runabouts I ever saw, while they were very nice cars, didn't
seem able to go so very fast, or very far."

"That's true, but it's because they didn't have the right kind of a
battery. You know an electric locomotive can make pretty good speed,
Dad. Over a hundred miles an hour in tests."

"Yes, but they don't run by storage batteries. They have a third rail,
and powerful motors," and Mr. Swift looked quizzically at his son. He
loved to argue with him, for he said it made Tom think, and often the
two would thus thresh out some knotty point of an invention, to the
interests of both.

"Of course, Dad, there is a good deal of theory in what I'm thinking
of," the lad admitted. "But it does seem to me that if you put the
right kind of a battery into an automobile, it could scoot along pretty
lively. Look what speed a trolley car can make."

"Yes, Tom, but there again they get their power from an overhead wire."

"Some of them don't. There's a new storage battery been invented by a
New Jersey man, which does as well as the third rail or the overhead
wire. It was after reading about his battery that I thought of a plan
for mine. It isn't anything like his; perhaps not as good in some ways,
but, for what I want, it is better in some respects, I think. For one
thing it can be recharged very quickly."

"Now Tom, look here," said Mr. Swift earnestly, laying aside his
papers, and coming over to where his son sat. "You know I never
interfere with your inventions. In fact, the more you think of the
better I like it. The airship you helped build certainly did all that
could be desired, and--"

"That reminds me. Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon are out in it now,"
interrupted Tom. "They ought to be back soon. Yes, Dad, the airship Red
Cloud certainly scooted along."

"And the submarine, too," continued the aged inventor. "Your ideas
regarding that were of service to me, and helped in our task of
recovering the treasure, but I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed
in the storage battery. You may get it to work, but I don't believe you
can make it powerful enough to attain any great speed. Why don't you
confine yourself to making a battery for stationary work?"

"Because, Dad, I believe I can build a speedy car, and I'm going to try
it. Besides I want to race Andy Foger, and beat him, even if I don't
win the prize. I'm going to build that car, and it will make fast time."

"Well, go ahead, Tom," responded his father, after a pause. "Of course
you can use the shops here as much as you want, and Mr. Sharp, Mr.
Jackson, and I will help you all we can. Only don't be disappointed,
that's all."

"I won't, Dad. Suppose you come out to my shop and I'll show you a
sample battery I've been testing for the last week. I have it geared to
a small motor, and it's been running steadily for some time. I want to
see what sort of a record it's made."

Father and son crossed the yard, and entered a shop which the lad
considered exclusively his own. There he had made many machines, and
pieces of apparatus, and had invented a number of articles which had
been patented, and yielded him considerable of an income.

"There's the battery, Dad," he said, pointing to a complicated
mechanism in one corner.

"What's that buzzing noise?" asked Mr. Swift. "That's the little motor
I run from the new cells. Look here," and Tom switched on an electric
light above the experimental battery, from which he hoped so much. It
consisted of a steel can, about the size of the square gallon tin in
which maple syrup comes, and from it ran two wires which were attached
to a small motor that was industriously whirring away.

Tom looked at a registering gauge connected with it.

"That's pretty good," remarked the young inventor.

"What is it, Tom?" and his father peered about the shop.

"Why this motor has run an equivalent of two hundred miles on one
charging of the battery! That's much better than I expected.  I thought
if I got a hundred out of it I'd be doing well. Dad, I believe, after I
improve my battery a bit, that I'll have the very thing I want!  I'll
install a set of them in a car, and it will go like the wind. I'll--"
Tom's enthusiastic remarks were suddenly interrupted by a low, rumbling
sound.

"Thunder!" exclaimed Mr. Swift. "The storm is coming, and Mr. Sharp and
Mr. Damon in the airship--"

Hardly had he spoken than there sounded a crash on the roof of the
Swift house, not far away. At the same time there came cries of
distress, and the crash was repeated.

"Come on, Dad!  Something has happened!" yelled Tom, dashing from the
shop, followed by his parent. They found themselves in the midst of a
rain storm, as they raced toward the house, on the roof of which the
smashing noise was again heard.




CHAPTER II

MR. DAMON'S STEERING


Tom Swift was a lad of action, and his quickness in hurrying out to
investigate what had happened when he was explaining about his new
battery, was characteristic of him. Those of my readers who know him,
through having read the previous books of this series, need not be told
this, but you who, perhaps, are just making his acquaintance, may care
to know a little more about him.

As told in my first book, "Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle" the young
inventor lived with his father, Barton Swift, a widower, in the town of
Shopton, New York. Mr. Swift was also an inventor of note.

In my initial volume of this series, Tom became possessed of a
motor-cycle in a peculiar way. It was sold to him by a Mr. Wakefield
Damon, a wealthy gentleman who was unfortunate in riding it. On his
speedy machine, which Tom improved by several inventions, he had a
number of adventures. The principal one was being attacked by a number
of bad men, known as the "Happy Harry Gang," who wished to obtain
possession of a valuable turbine patent model belonging to Mr. Swift.
Tom was taking it to a lawyer, when he was waylaid, and chloroformed.
Later he traced the gang, and, with the assistance of Mr. Damon and
Eradicate Sampson, an aged colored man who made a living for himself
and his mule, Boomerang, by doing odd jobs, the lad found the thieves
and recovered a motor-boat which had been stolen. But the men got away.

In the second volume, called "Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat," Tom bought
at auction the boat stolen by, and recovered from, the thieves, and
proceeded to improve it. While he was taking his father out on a cruise
for Mr. Swift's health, the Happy Harry Gang made a successful attempt
to steal some valuable inventions from the Swift house. Tom started to
trace them, and incidentally he raced and beat Andy Foger, a rich
bully. On their way down the lake, after the robbery, Tom, his father
and Ned Newton, Tom's chum, saw a man hanging from the trapeze of a
blazing balloon over Lake Carlopa. The balloonist was Mr. John Sharp
and he was rescued by Tom in a thrilling fashion. In his motor-boat,
Tom had much pleasure, not the least of which was taking out a young
lady named Miss Mary Nestor, whose acquaintance he had made after
stopping her runaway horse, which his bicycle had frightened.  Tom's
association with  Miss Nestor soon ripened into something deeper than
mere friendship.

It developed that Mr. Sharp, whom Tom had saved from the burning
balloon, was an aeronaut of note, and had once planned to build an
airship. After his recovery from his thrilling experience, he mentioned
the matter to Mr. Swift and his son, with whom he took up his
residence. This fitted right in with Tom's ideas, and soon father, son
and the balloonist were constructing the Red Cloud, as they named their
airship. It was finally completed, as related in "Tom Swift and His
Airship," made a successful trial trip, and won a prize. It was planned
to make a longer journey, and Tom, Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon agreed to go
together. Mr. Damon was an odd individual, who was continuously
blessing some part of his anatomy, his clothing or some inanimate
object but, for all that, he was a fine man.

The night before Tom and his friends started off in their airship, the
Shopton Bank vault was blown open and seventy-five thousand dollars was
taken. Tom and his friends did not know of this, but, no sooner had the
young inventor, Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon sailed away, than the police
arrived at Mr. Swift's house to arrest them. They were charged with the
robbery, and with having sailed away with the booty.

It appeared that Andy Foger said he had seen Tom hanging around the
bank the night of the robbery, with a bag of burglar tools in his
possession. Search was immediately begun for the airship, the occupants
of which were, meanwhile, speeding on.

Tom and his two friends had trouble. They were nearly burned up in a
forest fire, and were fired upon by a crowd of people with rifles, who,
reading of the bank robbery and the reward offered for the capture of
the thieves, hoped to bring down the airship.  The fact that they were
fired upon caused Tom and the two aeronauts to descend to make an
investigation, and for the first time they learned of the bank theft.
How they got track of the real robbers, took the sheriff with them in
the airship, and raided the gang will be found set down at length in
the book.  Also how Tom administered well-deserved thrashing to Andy
Foger.

Mr. Swift did not accompany his son in the airship, and when asked why
he did not care to make the trip, said he was working on a new type of
submarine boat, which he hoped to enter in the government trials, to
win a prize. In the fourth volume of the series, called "Tom Swift and
his Submarine," you may read how successful Mr. Swift was.

When the submarine, called the Advance, was finished, the party made a
trip to recover three hundred thousand dollars in gold from a sunken
treasure ship, off the coast of Uruguay, South America. They sailed
beneath the seas for many miles, and were in great peril at times. One
reason for this was that a rival firm of submarine builders got wind of
the treasure, and tried to get ahead of the Swifts in recovering it.
How Tom and his friends succeeded in their quest, how they nearly
perished at the bottom of the sea, how they were captured by a foreign
war vessel, and sentenced to death, how they fought with a school of
giant sharks and how they blew up the wreck to recover the money is all
told of in the book.

On their return to civilization with the gold, Mr. Swift, Tom, and
their friends deposited the money in the Shopton Bank, where Ned Newton
worked. Ned was a bright lad, but had not been advanced as rapidly as
he deserved, and Tom knew this. He asked his father to speak to the
president, Mr. Pendergast, in Ned's behalf, and, as a result the lad
was made assistant cashier, for the request of a man who controlled a
three hundred thousand dollar deposit was not to be despised.

In building the submarine Tom and his father rented a large cottage on
the New Jersey seacoast, but, on returning from their treasure-quest
they went back to Shopton, leaving the submarine at the boathouse of
the shore cottage, which was near the city of Atlantis. That was in the
fall of the year, and all that winter the young inventor had been busy
on many things, not the least of which was his storage battery. It was
now spring, and seeing the item in the paper, about the touring club
prize for an electric auto, had given him a new idea.

But all thoughts of electric cars, and everything else, were driven
from the mind of the young man, when, with his father, he rushed out to
see the cause of the crash on the roof of the Swift homestead.

"There's something up there, Tom," called his father, as he splashed on
through the rain.

"That's right," added his son. "And somebody, too, to judge by the fuss
they're making."

"Maybe the house has been struck by lightning!" suggested the aged
inventor.

"No, the storm isn't severe enough for that; and, besides, if the house
had been struck you'd hear Mrs. Baggert yelling, Dad.  She--"

At that moment a woman's voice cried out:

"Mr. Swift! Tom! Where are you? Something dreadful has happened!"

"There she goes!" remarked Mr. Swift, as he splashed into a mud puddle.

"Bless my deflection rudder!" suddenly cried a voice from the flat roof
of the Swift house. "Hello! I say, is anyone down there?"

"Yes, we are," answered Tom. "Is that you, Mr. Damon?"

"Bless my collar button! It certainly is."

"Where's Mr. Sharp? I don't hear him."

"Oh, I'm here all right," answered the balloonist. "I'm trying to get
the airship clear of the chimney. Mr. Damon--"

"Yes, I steered wrong!" interrupted the odd man. "Bless my liver pin,
but it was so dark I couldn't see, and when that clap of thunder came I
shifted the deflection rudder instead of the lateral one, and tried to
knock over your chimney."

"Are either of you hurt?" asked Mr. Swift anxiously.

"No, not at all," replied Mr. Sharp. "We were moving slowly, ready for
a landing."

"Is the airship damaged?" inquired Tom.

"I don't know. Not much, I guess," was the answer of the aeronaut.
"I've stopped the engine, and I don't like to start it again until I
can see what shape we're in."

"I'll come up, with Mr. Jackson," called Tom, and he hastily summoned
Garret Jackson, an engineer, who had been in the service of Mr. Swift
for many years. Together they proceeded to the roof by a stairway that
led to a scuttle.

"Is anyone killed?" asked Mrs. Baggert, as Tom hurried up the stairs.
"Don't tell me there is, Tom!"

"Well, I don't have to tell you, for no one is," replied the young
inventor with a laugh. "It's all right. The airship tried to collide
with the chimney, that's all."

He was soon on the large, flat roof of the dwelling, and, with the aid
of lanterns he, the engineer, and Mr. Sharp made a hasty examination.

"Anything wrong?" inquired Mr. Damon, looking out from the cabin of the
Red Cloud where he had taken refuge after the crash, and to get out of
the wet.

"Not much," answered Tom. "One of the forward planes is smashed, but we
can rise by means of the gas, and float down. Is all clear, Mr. Sharp?"

"All clear," replied the balloonist, for the airship had now been
wheeled back from the entanglement with the chimney.

"Then here we go!" cried Tom, as he and the aeronaut entered the craft,
while Mr. Jackson descended through the scuttle.

There came a fiercer burst to the storm, and, amid a series of dazzling
lightning flashes and the muttering of thunder, the airship rose from
the roof. Tom switched on the search-light, and, starting the big
propellers, guided the craft skillfully toward the big shed where it
was housed when not in use.

With the grace of a bird it turned about in the air, and settled to the
ground. It was the work of but a few minutes to run it into the shed.
Then they all started for the house.

"Bless my umbrella!  How it rains!" cried Mr. Damon, as he splashed on
through numerous puddles. "We got back just in time, Mr. Sharp."

"Where did you go?" asked the lad.

"Why we took a flight of about fifty miles and stopped at my house in
Waterfield for supper. Were you anxious about us?"

"A little when it began to storm," replied Tom.

"Anything new since we left?" asked Mr. Sharp, for it was the custom of
himself, or some of his friends, to take little trips in the airship.
They thought no more of it than many do of going for a short spin in an
automobile.

"Yes, there is something new," said Mr. Swift, as the party, all
drenched now, reached the broad veranda.

"Bless my gaiters!" cried Mr. Damon. "What is it? I hope the Happy
Harry gang hasn't robbed you again; nor Berg and his men tried to take
that treasure away from us, after we worked so hard to get it from the
wreck."

"No, it isn't that," replied Mr. Swift. "The truth is that Tom thinks
he has invented a storage battery that will revolutionize matters. He's
going to build an electric automobile, he says."

"I am," declared the lad, as the others looked at him, "and it will be
the speediest one you ever saw, too!"




CHAPTER III

THE MOTORCYCLE WINS


"Well, Tom," remarked Mr. Sharp, after a pause following the lad's
announcement. "I didn't know you had any ambitions in that line. Tell
us more about the battery. What system do you use; lead plates and
sulphuric acid?"

"Oh, that's out of date long ago," declared the lad.

"Well, I don't know much about electricity," admitted the aeronaut.
"I'll take my chances in an airship or a balloon, but when it comes to
electricity I'm down and out."

"So am I," admitted Mr. Damon. "Bless my gizzard, it's all I can do to
put a new spark plug in my automobile. Where is your new battery, Tom?"

"Out in my shop, running yet if it hasn't been frightened by the
airship smash," replied the lad, somewhat proudly. "It's an oxide of
nickel battery, with steel and oxide of iron negative electrodes."

"What solution do you use, Tom?" asked Mr. Swift. "I didn't get that
far in questioning you before the crash came," he added.

"Well I have, in the experimental battery, a solution of potassium
hydrate," replied the lad, "but I think I'm going to change it, and add
some lithium hydrate to it. I think that will make it stronger."

"Bless my watch chain!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "It's all Greek to me.
Suppose you let us see it, Tom? I like to see wheels go 'round, but I'm
not much of a hand for chemical terms."

"If you're sure you're not hurt by the airship smash, I will," declared
the lad.

"Oh, we're not hurt a bit," insisted Mr. Sharp. "As I said we were
moving slow, for I knew it was about time to land. Mr. Damon was
steering--"

"Yes I thought I'd try my hand at it, as it seemed so easy,"
interrupted the eccentric man. "But never again--not for mine! I
couldn't see the house, and, before I knew it we were right over the
roof. Then the chimney seemed to stick itself up suddenly in front of
us, and--well, you know the rest. I'm willing to pay for any damage I
caused."

"Oh, not at all!" replied Tom. "It's easy enough to put on a new plane,
or, for that matter, we can operate the Red Cloud without it. But come
on, I'll show you my sample battery."

"Here, take umbrellas!" Mrs. Baggert called after them as they started
toward the shop, for it was still raining.

"We don't mind getting wet," replied the young inventor. "It's in the
interests of science."

"Maybe it is. You don't mind a wetting, but I mind you coming in and
dripping water all over the carpets!" retorted the housekeeper.

"Bless my overshoes, I'm afraid we have wet the carpets a trifle now,"
admitted Mr. Damon ruefully, as he looked down at a puddle, which had
formed where he had been standing.

"That's the reason I want you to take umbrellas this trip," insisted
Mrs. Baggert.

They complied, and were soon in the shop, where Tom explained his
battery. The small motor was still running and had, as the lad had
said, gone the equivalent of over two hundred miles.

"If a small battery does as well as that, what will a larger one do?"
asked Mr. Damon.

"Much better, I hope," replied the youth. "But Dad doesn't seem to have
much faith in them."

"Well," admitted Mr. Swift, "I must say I am skeptical. Still, I
acknowledge Tom has done some pretty good work along electrical lines.
He helped me with the positive and negative plates on the submarine,
and, maybe--well, we'll wait and see," he concluded.

"If you build a car I hope you give me a ride in it," said Mr. Damon.
"I've ridden fast in the air, and swiftly on top of, and under, the
water. Now I'd like to ride rapidly on top of the earth. The gasolene
auto doesn't go very fast."

"I'll give you a ride that will make your hair stand up!" prophesied
Tom, and the time was to come when he would make good that prediction.

The little party in the machine shop talked at some length about Tom's
battery. He showed them how it was constructed, and gave them some of
his ideas regarding the new type of auto he planned to build.

"Well," remarked Mr. Swift at length, "if you want to keep your brain
fresh, Tom, you must get to bed earlier than this. It's nearly twelve
o'clock."

"And I want to get up early!" exclaimed the lad. "I'm going to start to
build a larger battery to-morrow."

"And I'm going to repair the airship," added Mr. Sharp.

"Bless my night cap, I promised my wife I'd be home early to-night,
too!" suddenly exclaimed Mr. Damon. "I don't fancy making the trip back
to Waterfield in my auto, though. Something will be sure to happen.
I'll blow out a tire, or a spark plug will get sooty on me and--"

"It's raining harder than ever," interrupted Tom. "Better stay here
to-night. You can telephone home."  Which Mr. Damon did.

Tom was up early the next morning, in spite of the fact that he did not
go to bed in good season, and before breakfast he was working at his
new storage battery. After the meal he hurried back to the shop, but it
was not long before he came out, wheeling his motor-cycle.

"Where are you going, Tom?" asked Mrs. Baggert.

"Oh, I've got to go to Mansburg to get some steel tubes for my new
battery," he replied. "I thought I had some large enough, but I
haven't."  Mansburg was a good-sized town, near Shopton.

"Then I wish you'd bring me a bottle of stove polish," requested the
housekeeper. "The liquid kind. I'm out of it, and the stove is as red
as a cow."

"All right," agreed the lad, as he leaped into the saddle and pedaled
off down the road. A moment later he had turned on the power, and was
speeding along the highway, which was in good condition on account of
the shower of the night before.

Tom was thinking so deeply of his new invention, and planning what he
would do when he had his electric runabout built, that, almost before
he knew it, he had reached Mansburg, purchased the steel tubes, and the
stove polish, and was on his way back again.

As he was speeding along on a level road, he heard, coming behind him,
an automobile. The lad turned to one side, but, in spite of this the
party in the car began a serenade of the electric siren, and kept it
up, making a wild discord.

"What's the matter with those fellows!" inquired Tom of himself.
"Haven't I given them enough of the road, or has their steering gear
broken?"

He looked back over his shoulder, and it needed but a glance to show
that the car was all right, as regarded the steering apparatus. And it
needed only another glance to disclose the reason for the shrill sound
of the siren.

"Andy Foger!" exclaimed Tom. "I might have known. And Sam and Pete are
with him. Well, if he wants to make me get off the road, he'll find
that I've got as much right as he has!"

He kept on a straight course, wondering if the red-haired, and
squint-eyed bully would dare try to damage the motor-cycle.

A little later Andy's car was beside Tom.

"Why don't you get out of the way," demanded Sam, who could usually be
depended on to aid Andy in all his mean tricks.

"Because I'm entitled to half the road," retorted our hero.

"Humph! A slow-moving machine like yours hasn't any right on the road,"
sneered Andy, who had slowed down his car somewhat.

"I haven't, eh?" demanded Tom. "Well, if you'll get down out of that
car for a few minutes I'll soon show you what my rights are!"

Now Andy, more than once, had come to personal encounters with Tom,
much to the anguish of the bully. He did not relish another
chastisement, but his mean spirit could not brook interference.

"Don't you want a race?" he inquired of Tom, in a sneering tone. "I'll
give you a mile start, and beat you! I've got the fastest car built!"

"You have, eh?" asked Tom, while a grim look came over his face. "Maybe
you'll think differently some day."

"Aw, he's afraid to race; come on," suggested Pete. "Don't bother with
him, Andy."

"No, I guess it wouldn't be worth my while," was the reply of the
bully, and he threw the second gear into place, and began to move away
from the young inventor.

Tom was just as much pleased to be left alone, but he did not want Andy
Foger to think that he could have matters all his own way. Tom's
motor-cycle, since he had made some adjustments to it, was very swift.
In fact there were few autos that could beat it.  He had never tried it
against Andy's new car, and he was anxious to do so.

"I wonder if I would stand any chance, racing him?" thought the young
inventor, as he saw the car slowly pulling away from him.  "I think
I'll wait until he gets some distance ahead, and then I'll see how near
I can come to him. If I get anywhere near him I'm pretty sure I can
pass him. I'll try it."

When Andy and his cronies looked back, Tom did not appear to be doing
anything save moving along at moderate speed on his machine.

"You don't dare race!" Pete Bailey shouted to him.

"Wait," was what Tom whispered to himself.

Andy's car was now some distance ahead. The young inventor waited a
little longer, and then turned more power into his machine. It leaped
forward and began to "eat up the road," as Tom expressed it. He had
seen Andy throw in the third gear, but knew that there was a fourth
speed on the bully's car.

"I don't know whether I can beat him on that or not," thought the lad
dubiously. "If I try, and fail, they'll laugh at me. But I don't think
I'm going to fail."

Faster and faster he rode. He was rapidly overhauling Andy's car now,
and, as they heard him approach, the three cronies turned around.

"He's going to race you, after all, Andy!" cried Sam.

"You mean he's going to try," sneered Andy. "I'll give him all the
racing he wants!"

In another few seconds Tom was beside the auto, and would have passed
it, only Andy opened his throttle a little more. For a moment the auto
jumped ahead, and then, as our hero turned on still more power, he
easily held his own.

"Aw, you can never beat us!" yelled Pete.

"Of course not!" added Sam.

"I'll leave him behind in a second," prophesied Andy. "Wait until I
throw in the other gear," he added to his cronies in a low voice. "He
thinks he's going to beat me. I'll let him think so, and then I'll
spurt ahead."

The two machines were now racing along side by side. Andy's car was
going the limit on third gear, but he still had the fourth gear in
reserve. Tom, too, still had a little margin of speed.

Suddenly Andy reached forward and yanked on a lever. There was a
grinding of cogs as the fourth gear slipped into place, for Andy did
not handle his car skillfully. The effect, however, was at once
apparent. The automobile shot forward.

"Now where are you, Tom Swift?" cried Sam.

Tom said nothing. He merely shifted a lever, and got a better spark. He
also turned on a little more gasolene and opened the muffler. The
quickness with which his motor-cycle shot forward almost threw him from
the saddle, but he had a tight grip on the handle bars. He whizzed past
the auto, but, as the latter gathered speed, it crept up to him, and,
once more was on even terms. Much chagrined at seeing Tom hold pace
with him, even for an instant, Andy shouted:

"Get over on your own side there! You're crowding me!"

"I am not!" yelled back Tom, above the explosions of his machine.

The two were now racing furiously, and Andy, with a savage look, tried
to get more speed out of his car. In spite of all the bully did, Tom
was gradually forging ahead. A little hill was now in view.

"Here's where I make him take my dust!" cried Andy, but, to his
surprise Tom still kept ahead. The auto began to lose ground, for it
was not made to take hills on high gear.

"Change to third gear quick!" cried Sam.

Andy tried to do it. There was a hesitancy on the part of his car. It
seemed to balk. Tom, looking back, slowed up a trifle. He could afford
to, as Andy was being beaten.

"Go on! Go on!" begged Pete. "You'll have to keep on fourth gear to
beat him, Andy."

"That's what!" murmured the bully. Once more he shifted the gears.
There was a grinding, smashing sound, and the car lost speed. Then it
slowed up still more, and finally stopped. Then it began to back down
hill.

"I've stripped those blamed gears!" exclaimed Andy ruefully.

"Can't you beat him?" asked Pete.

"I could have, easily, if my gears hadn't broken," declared the bully,
but, as a matter of fact, he could not have done so. "I oughtn't to
have changed, going up hill," he added, as he jammed on the brakes, to
stop the car from sliding down the slope.

Tom saw and heard.

"I thought you were so anxious to race," he said, exultantly, as well
he might. "I don't want to try a contest down hill, though, Andy," and
he laughed at the red-haired lad, who was furious.

"Aw, go on!" was all the retort the squint-eyed one could think of to
make.

"I am going on," replied our hero. "Just to show you that I can go down
hill, watch me."

He turned his motor-cycle, and approached Andy's stalled car, for Tom
was some distance in advance of it, up the slope by this time. As he
approached the auto, containing the three disconcerted cronies,
something bounded out of Tom's pocket. It was the bottle of stove
blacking he had purchased for Mrs. Baggert. The bottle fell in the soft
dirt in front of his forward wheel, and a curious thing happened.
Perhaps you have seen a bicycle or auto tire strike a stone at an
angle, and throw it into the air with great force. That was what
happened to the bottle. Tom's front wheel struck the cork, which fitted
tightly, and, just as when you hit one end of the wooden "catty" and it
bounds up, the bottle described a curve through the air, and flew
straight toward Andy's car. It struck the brass frame of the wind
shield with a crash.

The bottle broke, and in an instant the black liquid was spattered all
over Andy, Sam and Pete. It could not have been done more effectively
if Tom had thrown it by hand. All over their clothes, their hands and
faces, and the front of the car went the dreary black. Tom looked on,
hardly able to believe what he saw.

"Wow! Wup! Ug! Blug! Mug!" spluttered Sam, who had some of the stuff in
his mouth.

"Oh! Oh!" yelled Pete.

"You did that on purpose, Tom Swift!" shouted Andy, wiping some of the
blacking from his left eye. "I'll have you arrested for that! You've
ruined my car, and look at my suit!"

"Mine's worse!" murmured Sam, glancing down at his light trousers,
which were of the polka-dot pattern now.

"No, mine is," insisted Pete, whose white shirt was of the hue of a
stove pipe.

Andy wiped some of the black stuff from his nose, whence it was
dropping on the steering wheel.

"You just wait!" the bully called to Tom. "I'll get even with you for
this!"

"It was an accident! I didn't mean to do that," explained Tom, trying
not to laugh, as he dismounted from his motor-cycle, ready to render
what assistance he could.




CHAPTER IV

TALK OF A NEW BANK


The three cronies were in a sorrowful plight. The black fluid dripped
from them, and formed little puddles in the car. Andy had used his
handkerchief to wipe some of the stuff from his face, but the linen was
soon useless, for it quickly absorbed the blacking.

"There's a little brook over here," volunteered Tom. "You might wash in
that. The stuff comes off easily. It isn't like ink," and he had to
laugh, as he thought of the happening.

"Here! You quit that!" ordered Andy. "You've gone too far, Tom Swift!"

"Didn't I tell you it was an accident?" inquired the young inventor.

"It wasn't!" cried Sam. "You threw the bottle at us! I saw you!"

"It slipped from my pocket," declared the youth, and he described how
the accident occurred. "I'll help you clean your car, Andy," he added.

"I don't want your help! If you come near me I'll--I'll punch your
nose!" cried Andy, now almost beside himself with rage.

"All right, if you don't want my help I don't care," answered Tom, glad
enough not to have to soil his hands and clothes. He felt that it was
partly his fault, and he would have done all he could to remedy
matters, but his good offers being declined, he felt that it was
useless to insist further.

He remounted his motor-cycle, and rode off, the last view he had of the
trio being one where they were at the edge of the brook, trying to
remove the worst traces of the black fluid. As Tom turned around for a
final glimpse, Andy shook his fist at him, and called out something.

"I guess Andy'll have it in for me," mused Tom. "Well, I can't help it.
I owed him something on account, but I didn't figure on paying it in
just this way," and he thought of the time the bully had locked him in
the ballast tanks of the submarine, thereby nearly smothering him to
death.

That night Andy Foger told his father what had happened, for Mr. Foger
inquired the reason for the black stains on his son's face and hands.
But Andy did not give the true version. He said Tom had purposely
thrown the bottle of blacking at him.

"So that's the kind of a lad Tom Swift is, eh?" remarked Andy's father.
"Well, Andy, I think you will soon have a chance to get even with him."

"How, pop?"

"I can't tell you now, but I have a plan for making Tom sorry he ever
did anything to you, and I will also pay back some old scores to Mr.
Swift and Mr. Damon. I'll ruin their bank for them, that's what I'll
do."

"Ruin their bank, pop? How?"

"You wait and see. The Swift crowd will get off their high horse soon,
or I'm mistaken. My plans are nearly completed, but I can't tell you
about them. I'll ruin Mr. Swift, though, that's what I'll do," and Mr.
Foger shook his head determinedly.

Tom was soon at his home, and Mrs. Baggert, hearing the noise of his
machine, as it entered the front yard, came to the side door.

"Where's my blacking?" she asked, as our hero dismounted and untied the
bundle of steel tubes he had purchased.

"I--I used it," he answered, laughing.

"Tom Swift! You don't mean to say you took my stove polish to use in
your battery, do you?"

"No, I used it to polish off Andy Foger and some of his cronies," and
the young inventor told, with much gusto, what had happened. Mrs.
Baggert could not help joining in the laugh, and when Tom offered to
ride back and purchase some more of the polish for her, she said it did
not matter, as she could wait until the next day.

The lad was soon busy in his machine shop, making several larger cells
for the new storage battery. He wanted to give it a more severe test.
He worked for several days on this, and when he had one unit of cells
complete, he attached the motor for an efficiency trial.

"We'll see how many miles that will make," he remarked to his father.

"Have you thought anything of the type of car you are going to build?"
asked the aged inventor of his son.

"Yes, somewhat. It will be almost of the regulation style, but with two
removable seats at the rear, with curtains for protection, and a place
in front for two persons. This can also be protected with curtains when
desired."

"But what about the motors and the battery?"

"They will be located under the middle of the car. There will be one
set of batteries there, together with the motor, and another set of
batteries will be placed under the removable seats in what I call the
tonneau, though, of course, it isn't really that. A smaller set will
also be placed forward, and there will be ample room for carrying tools
and such things."

"About how far do you expect your car will go with one charging of the
battery?"

"Well, if I can make it do three hundred miles I'll be satisfied, but
I'm going to try for four hundred."

"What will you do when your battery runs out?"

"Recharge it."

"Suppose you're not near a charging station?"

"Well, Dad, of course those are some of the details I've got to work
out. I'm planning a register gauge now, that will give warning about
fifty miles before the battery is run down. That will leave me a margin
to work on. And I'm going to have it fixed so I can take current from
any trolley line, as well as from a regular charging station. My battery
will be capable of being recharged very quickly, or, in case of need, I
can take out the old cells and put in new ones.

"That's a very good idea. Well, I hope you succeed."

A few evenings after this, when Tom was busy in his machine shop, he
heard some one enter. He looked up from the gauge of the motor, which
he was studying, and, for a moment, he could make out nothing in the
dark interior of the shop, for he was working in a brilliant light.

"Who's there?" he called sharply, for, more than once unscrupulous men
had endeavored to sneak into the Swift shops to steal ideas of
inventions; if not the actual apparatus itself.

"It's me--Ned Newton," was the cheerful reply.

"Oh, hello, Ned! I was wondering what had become of you," responded
Tom. "Where have you been lately?"

"Oh, working overtime."

"What's the occasion?"

"We're trying out a new system to increase the bank business."

"What's the matter? Aren't you folks getting business enough, after the
big deposits we made of the bullion from the wreck?"

"Oh, it's not that. But haven't you heard the news? There is talk of
starting a rival bank in Shopton, and that may make us hustle to hold
what business we have, to say nothing of getting new customers."

"A new bank, eh? Who's going to start it?"

"Andy Foger's father, I hear. You know he was a director in our bank,
but he got out last week."

"What for?"

"Well, he had some difficulty with Mr. Pendergast, the president. I
fancy you had something to do with it, too."

"I?"  Tom was plainly surprised.

"Yes, you know you and Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp captured the bank
robbers, and got back most of the money."

"I guess I do remember it! I wish you could have seen the gang when we
raided them from the clouds, in our airship!"

"Well, you know Andy Foger hoped to collect the five thousand dollars
reward for telling the police that you were the thief, and of course he
got fooled, for you got the reward. Mr. Foger expected his son would
collect the money, and when Andy got left, it made him sore. He's had a
grudge against Mr. Pendergast, and all the other bank officials ever
since, and now he's going to start a rival bank. So that's why I said
it was partly due to you."

"Oh, I see. I thought at first you meant that it was on account of
something that happened the other day."

"What was that?"

"Andy, Sam and Pete got the contents of a bottle of stove blacking,"
and Tom related the occurrence, at which Ned laughed heartily.

"I wouldn't be surprised though," added Ned, "to learn that Mr. Foger
started the new bank more for revenge than anything else."

"So that's the reason you've been working late, eh?" went on Tom.
"Getting ready for competition. Do you think a new bank will hurt the
one you're with?"

"Well, it might," admitted Ned. "It's bound to make a change, anyhow,
and now that I have a good position I don't want to lose it. I take
more of an interest in the institution now that I'm assistant cashier,
than I did when I was a clerk. So, naturally, I'm a little worried."

"Say, don't let it worry you," begged Tom, earnestly.

"Why not?"

"Because I know my father and Mr. Damon will stick to the old bank.
They won't have anything to do with the one Andy Foger's father starts.
Don't you worry."

"Well, that will help some," declared Ned. "They are both heavy
depositors, and if they stick to the old bank we can stand it even if
some of our smaller customers desert us."

"That's the way to talk," went on the young inventor. "Let Foger start
his bank. It won't hurt yours."

"What are you making now?" asked Ned, a little later, looking with
interest at the machinery over which Tom was bending, and to which he
was making adjustments.

"New electric automobile. I want to beat Andy Foger's car worse than I
did on my motor-cycle, and I also want to win a prize," and the lad
proceeded to relate the incidents leading up to his construction of the
storage battery.

Tom and Ned were in the shop until long past midnight, and then the
bank employee, with a look at his watch, exclaimed:

"Great Scott! I ought to be home."

"I'll run you over in Mr. Damon's car," proposed Tom. "He left it here
the other day, while he and his wife went off on a trip, and he said I
could use it whenever I wanted to."

"Good!" cried Ned.

The two lads came from Tom's particular workshop. As the young inventor
closed the door he started suddenly, as he snapped shut the lock.

"What's the matter?" asked Ned quickly.

"I thought I heard a noise," replied Tom.

They both listened. There was a slight rustling in some bushes near the
shop.

"It's a dog or a cat," declared Ned.

Tom took several cautious steps forward. Then he gave a spring, and
made a grab for some one or something.

"Here! You let me be!" yelled a protesting voice.

"I will when I find out what you mean by sneaking around here,"
retorted Tom, as he came back toward Ned, dragging with him a lad. "It
wasn't a dog or a cat, Ned," spoke the young inventor.  "It's Sam
Snedecker," and so it proved.

"You let me alone!" demanded Andy Foger's crony. "I ain't done nothin'
to you," he whined.

"Here, Ned, you hold him a minute, while I make an investigation,"
called Tom, handing his prisoner over to his chum. "Maybe Pete or Andy
are around."

"No, they ain't. I came alone," said Sam quickly, but Tom, not heeding,
opened the shop, and, after turning on the electric lights, procured a
lantern. He began a search of the shrubbery around the shop, while Ned
held to the struggling Sam.




CHAPTER V

A MIDNIGHT ENCOUNTER


The moment Tom disappeared behind his machine shop, Sam Snedecker began
a desperate struggle to escape from Ned Newton.  Now Ned was a muscular
lad, but his work in the bank was confining, and he did not have the
chance to get out doors and exercise, as Sam had. Consequently Ned had
his hands full in holding to the squirming crony of Andy Foger.

"You let me go!" demanded Sam, as he tried to twist loose.

"Not if I know it!" panted Ned.

Sam gave a sudden twist. Ned's foot slipped in the grass, and in a
moment he went down, with Sam on top of him. Still he did not let go,
and, finding he was still a prisoner Sam adopted new tactics.

Using his fists Sam began to pound Ned, but the bank employee, though
suffering, would not call for help, to summon back Tom, who was, by
this time, at the rear of the shop, looking about.  Silently in the
dark the two fought, and Ned found that Sam was getting away. Then
Ned's hand came in contact with Sam's ear. It was the misfortune of the
bully to have rather a large hearing apparatus, and once Ned got his
fingers on an ear there was room enough to afford a good grip. He
closed his hold tightly, and began to twist. This was too much for Sam.
He set up a lusty howl.

"Wow! Ouch! Let go!" he pleaded, and he ceased to pound Ned, and no
longer tried to escape. Tom came back on the run.

"What's the matter?" he cried. Then his light flashed on the two
prostrate lads, and he understood without asking any further questions.

"Get up!" he cried, seizing Sam by the back of his neck, and yanking
him to his feet. Ned arose, and secured a better grip on the sneaking
lad.

"What's up?" demanded Tom, and Ned explained, following it by the
question:

"See any more of 'em?"

"No, I guess he was here all alone," replied the young inventor. "What
do you mean by sneaking around here this time of night?" he demanded of
the captive.

"Don't you wish you knew?" was Sam's answer, with a leer. He realized
that he had a certain advantage.

"You'd better tell before I turn you over to the police!" said Tom,
sternly.

"You--you wouldn't do that; would you?" and Sam's voice that had been
bold, became shaky.

"You were trespassing on our property, and that's against the law,"
declared Tom. "We have signs posted, warning people to keep off."

"I didn't mean any harm," whined Sam.

"Then what were you doing here, at this hour?"

"I was just taking a short cut home. I was out riding with Andy in his
auto, and it broke down. I had to walk home, and I came this way. I
didn't know you didn't allow people to cross your back lot. I wasn't
doin' anything."

Tom hesitated. Sam might be telling the truth, but it was doubtful.

"What happened to Andy's auto?" the young inventor asked.

"He broke a wheel, going over a big stone on Berk's hill. He went to
tell some one in the repair shop to go after the car, and I came on
home. You've got no right to arrest me."

"I ought to, on general principles," commented Tom. "Well, skip out,
and don't you come around here again. I'm going to get a savage bull
dog, and the first one who comes sneaking around here after dark will
be sorry. Move along now!"

Tom and Ned released their holds of Sam, and the latter lost no time in
obeying the injunction to make himself scarce. He was soon lost to
sight in the darkness.

"Think he was up to some mischief?" asked Ned.

"I'm almost sure of it," replied Tom, "but I can't see anything wrong.
I guess we were too quick for him. I believe he, Andy and Pete Bailey
tried to put up some job on me."

"Maybe they wanted to damage your new battery or car," suggested Ned.

"Hardly that. The car hasn't been started yet, and as for the battery,
no one knows of it outside of you and my friends here.  I'm keeping it
secret. Well, if I'm going to take you home I'd better get a move on.
Wait here and I'll run out Mr. Damon's car."

In a short time Tom was guiding the machine over the road to Shopton,
Ned on the seat beside him. The young assistant cashier lived about a
mile the other side of the village, and the two chums were soon at his
house. Asking his friend to come and see him when he had a chance. Ned
bid his chum good night, and the young inventor started back home.

He was driving slowly along, thinking more of his new invention than
anything else, even more than of the mysterious visit of Sam Snedecker,
when the lights on Mr. Damon's car flashed upon something big, black
and bulky on the road just ahead of him.  Tom, brought suddenly out of
his fit of musing, jammed on the brakes, and steered to one side. Then
he saw that the object was a stalled auto. He had only time to note
this when a voice hailed him:

"Have you a tire pump you could lend us? Ours doesn't work, and we have
had a blowout."

There was something about the voice that was strangely familiar, and
Tom was wondering where he had heard it before, when into the glare of
the lamps on his machine stepped Mr. Foger--Andy's father!

"Why, Mr. Foger!" exclaimed Tom. "I didn't know it was you."

"Oh, it's Tom Swift," remarked the man, and he did not seem especially
pleased.

"Hey! What's that?" cried another voice, which Tom had no difficulty in
recognizing as belonging to Andy. "What's the matter, Dad?"

"Why it happens to be your--ahem! It's Tom Swift in this other auto,"
went on Mr. Foger. "I didn't know you had a car," he added.

"I haven't," answered the lad. "This belongs to Mr. Damon. But can you
see to fix your tire in the dark?" for Mr. Foger and his son had no
lamps lighted.

"Oh, we have it all fixed," declared the man, "and, just as we were
going to pump it up out lamps went out. Then we found that our pump
wouldn't work. If you have one I would be obliged for the use of it,"
and he spoke somewhat stiffly.

"Certainly," agreed Tom, cheerfully, for he had no special grudge
against Mr. Foger, though had he known Andy's father's plans, perhaps
our hero would not have so readily aided him. The young inventor got
down, removed one of his oil lamps in order that there might be some
light on the operation, and then brought over his pump.

"I heard you had an accident," said Tom, a chain of thoughts being
rapidly forged in his mind, as he thought of what Sam had told him.

"You heard of it?" repeated Mr. Foger, while Andy was busy pumping up
the tire.

"Yes, a friend who was out riding with you said you had broken a wheel
on Berk's hill. But I see he was slightly wrong. You're a good way from
Berk's hill, and it's a tire that is broken, not a wheel."

"But I don't understand," said Mr. Foger. "No friend has been out
riding with us. My son and I were out on a business trip, and--"

"Come on, pop. I've got it all pumped up. Jump in. There's your pump,
Tom Swift. Much obliged," muttered Andy hastily.  It was very evident
that he wanted to prevent any further conversation between his parent
and Tom.

"But I don't understand," went on the banker, clearly puzzled.  "What
friend gave you such information, Mr.--er--Tom Swift?"

"Sam Snedecker," replied the lad quickly. "I caught him sneaking around
my machine shop about an hour ago, and when I asked him what he was
doing he said he'd been out riding with Andy, and that they broke a
wheel. I'm glad it was only a blown-out tire," and Tom's voice had a
curious note in it.

"But there must be some mistake," insisted Mr. Foger. "Sam Snedecker
was not riding with us this evening. We have been over to
Waterfield--my son and I, and--"

"Come on, pop!" cried Andy desperately. "We must hurry home.  Mom will
be worried."

"Yes, I think she will. But I can't understand why Sam should say such
a thing. However, we are much obliged for the use of your pump, Swift,
and--"

But Andy prevented any further talk by starting the car with the
muffler open, making a great racket, and he hurriedly drove off, almost
before his father was seated, leaving Tom standing there in the road,
beside his pump and lantern.

"So," mused the young inventor, "there's some game on. Sam wasn't with
Andy, yet Andy evidently knew where Sam was, or he wouldn't have been
so anxious to choke off talk. Mr. Foger knew nothing of Sam, naturally.
But why have Andy and his father been on a midnight trip to Waterfield?"

That last question caused Tom to adopt a new line of thought.

"Waterfield," he mused. "That's where Mr. Damon lives. Mr. Damon is a
heavy depositor in the old bank. Mr. Foger is going to start a new
bank. I wonder if there's any connection there? This is getting
mysterious. I must keep my eyes open. I never expected to meet Andy and
his father to-night, any more than I expected to find Sam Snedecker
sneaking around my shop, but it's a good thing I discovered both
parties. I guess Andy must have had nervous prostration when I was
talking to his father," and Tom grinned at the thought. Then, picking
up the pump, and fastening the lantern in place, he drove Mr. Damon's
auto slowly back home.

Tom said nothing to his father or Mr. Sharp, the next morning, about
the incidents of the previous night. In the first place he could not
exactly understand them, and he wanted to devote more time to thinking
of them, before he mentioned the matter to his parent. Another reason
was that Mr. Swift was a very nervous person, and the least thing out
of the ordinary worried him. So the young inventor concluded to keep
quiet.

His first act, after going to look at the small motor, which was being
run with the larger, experimental storage battery, was to get out
pencil and paper.

"I've got to plan the electric auto now that my battery is in a fair
way to success," he said, for he noted that the one cell he had
constructed had done over twice as much mileage in proportion, as had
the small battery. "I'll soon start building the car," mused Tom, "and
then I'll enter it in the race. I must write to that touring club and
find how much time I have."

All that morning the young inventor drew plan after plan for an
electric runabout, and rejected them. Finally he threw aside paper and
pencil and exclaimed:

"It's no use. I can't think to-day. I'm dwelling too much on what
happened last night. I must clear my brain.

"I know what I'll do. I'll get in my motor-boat and take a run over to
Waterfield to see Mr. Damon. Maybe he's home by this time. Then I can
ask him what Mr. Foger wanted to see him about, if he did call."

It was a fine May morning, and Tom was soon in his boat, the Arrow,
gliding over Lake Carlopa, the waters of which sparkled in the sun. As
he speeded up his craft, the lad looked about, thinking he might catch
sight of Andy Foger, for the bully also owned a boat, called the Red
Streak and, more than once, in spite of the fact that Andy's craft was
the more powerful, Tom had beaten him in impromptu races. But there was
no sign of his rival this morning, and Tom kept on to Waterfield. He
found that Mr. Damon had not yet returned home.

"So far I've had my run for nothing," mused the youth. "Well, I might
as well spend the rest of the morning in the boat."

He swung his craft out into the lake, and headed back toward Mansburg,
intending to run up to the head of the body of water, which offered so
many attractions that beautiful morning.

As Tom passed a small dock he saw a girl just putting out in a rowboat.
The figure looked familiar and, having nothing special to do, the lad
steered over closer. His first view was confirmed, and he called out
cheerfully:

"Good morning, Miss Nestor. Going for a row?"

"Oh! Mr. Swift!" exclaimed the girl with a blush.  "I didn't hear you
coming. You startled me."

"Yes, the engine runs quite silently since I fixed it," resumed Tom.
"But where are you going?"

"I was going for a row," answered the girl, "but I have just discovered
that one of the oar locks is broken, so I am not going for a row," and
she laughed, showing her white, even teeth.

"That's too bad!" remarked the lad. "I don't suppose," he added
doubtfully, "that I could induce you to accept a motor-boat as a
substitute for a rowing craft, could I?" and he looked quizzically at
her.

"Are you asking me that as a hypothetical question?" she inquired.

"Yes," said Tom, trying not to smile.

"Well, if you are asking for information, merely, I will say that I
could be induced to make such a change," and her face was nearly as
grave as that of the young inventor's.

"What inducement would have to be used?" he asked.

"Suppose you just ask me in plain English to come and have a ride?" she
suggested.

"All right, I will!" exclaimed the youth.

"All right, then I'll come!" she retorted with a laugh, and a few
minutes later the two were in the Arrow, making a pretty picture as
they speeded up the lake.




CHAPTER VI

BUILDING THE CAR


"Well," remarked Tom to himself, about two hours later, when he had
left Mary Nestor at her dock, and was on his way home, "I feel better
than I did, and now I must do some hard thinking about my runabout. I
want to get it the right shape to make the least resistance." He began
to make some sketches when he got home, and at dinner he showed them to
his father and Mr. Sharp.  He said he had gotten an idea from looking
at the airship.

"I'm going to make the front part, or what corresponds to the
engine-hood in a gasolene car, pointed," he explained. "It will be just
like the front of the aluminum gas container of the airship, only built
of steel. In it will be a compartment for a set of batteries, and there
will be a searchlight there. From the top of some supporters in front
of the two rear seats, a slanting sheet of steel will come right down
to meet the sloping nose of the car. First I was going to have curtains
close over the top of the driver's seat, but I think a steel covering,
with a celluloid opening will be better and make less wind resistance.
I'll use leather side curtains when it rains. Under the front seats
will be a compartment for more batteries, and there will be a third
place under the rear seats, where I will also carry spare wheels and a
repair kit. The motors will be slung under the body of the car,
amidships, and there will also be room for some batteries there."

"How are you going to drive the car?" asked Mr. Sharp. "By a shaft?"

"Chain drive," explained Tom. "I can get more power that way, and it
will be more flexible under heavy loads. Of course it will be steered
in the usual way, and near the wheel will be the starting and reversing
levers, and the gear handle."

"Gears!" exclaimed the aged inventor. "Are you going to gear an
electric auto? I never heard of that. Usually the motor directly
connected is all they use."

"I'm going to have two gears on mine," decided Tom.

"That's a new idea," commented the aeronaut.

"It is," admitted the lad, "and that's why my car is going to be so
speedy. I'll make her go a hundred miles an hour, if necessary!"

"Nonsense!" exclaimed his father.

"I will!" cried the young inventor, enthusiastically. "You just wait
and see. I couldn't do it but for the gears, but by using them I'll
secure more speed, especially with the big reserve battery power I'll
have. I know I've got the right idea, and I'm going to get right to
work."

His father and Mr. Sharp were much interested, and closely examined his
sketches. In a few days Tom had made detailed drawings, and the aged
inventor looked at them critically. He had to admit that his son's
theory was right, though how it would work out in practice was yet to
be demonstrated. Mr. Swift offered some suggestions for minor changes,
as did Mr. Sharp, and the lad adopted some of them. Then, with Mr.
Jackson to help him, work was started on constructing the car.

Certain parts of it could be better purchased in the open market
instead of being manufactured in Mr. Swift's shop, and thus Tom was
able to get his new invention into some sort of shape sooner than would
otherwise have been the case. He also started making the batteries,
many of which would be needed.

Gradually the car began to take form on the floor of Tom's shop. It was
rather a curious looking affair, the sharp forward part making it
appear like some engine of war, or a projectile for some monster gun.
But Tom cared little for looks. Speed, strength and ease of control
were the chief features the lad aimed at, and he incorporated many new
ideas into his electric car.

He was busy in the shop, one morning, when, above the noise caused by
filing a piece of steel he heard some one exclaim:

"Bless my gizzard! If you aren't as busy as ever!"

"Mr. Damon!" cried Tom in delight. "When did you get back?"

"Last night," replied the eccentric man. "My wife and I stayed longer
than we meant to. And whom do you think we met when we were off on our
little trip?"

"Some of the Happy Harry gang?"

"Oh no. You'd never guess, so I'll tell you. It was Captain Weston."

"Indeed! And how has he been since he went in the submarine with us,
and helped recover the gold from the wreck?"

"Very well. The first thing he said to me was: 'How is Tom Swift and
his father, if I may be permitted to ask?'"

"Ha! Ha!" laughed the lad, at the recollection of the odd sea captain,
who generally tagged on an apologetic expression to most of his remarks.

"He was getting ready to take part in some South American revolution,"
went on Mr. Damon. "He used most of his money that he got from the
wreck to help finance their cause."

"I must tell Mr. Sharp," went on the lad. "He'll be interested."

"Anything new since I've been away?" asked the odd man. "Bless my shoe
laces, but I'm glad to get back!"

Tom told of the prospect of a new bank being started, and of Sam's
midnight visit, as well as the encounter with Mr. Foger and Andy.

"I went over to see what Mr. Foger wanted of you," went on the young
inventor, "but you weren't home. Did he call?"

"The servant said he had been there, not once, but several times,"
remarked Mr. Damon. "That reminds me. He left a note for me, and I
haven't read it yet. I'll do so now."

He tore open the letter, and hastily perused the contents.

"Ha!" he exclaimed. "So that's what he wanted to see me about!"

"What?" inquired Tom, with the privilege of an old friend.

"Mr. Foger says he's going to start a new bank, and he wants me to
withdraw my deposit from the old one, and put it in his institution.
Says he'll pay me bigger interest. And he adds that some of the old
employees have gone with him."

"I hope you're not going to change," spoke Tom, thinking of his chum,
Ned.

"Indeed I'm not. The old bank is good enough for me. By the way,
doesn't a friend of yours work there?"

"Yes, Ned Newton. I'm wondering how he'll be affected?"

"Don't you worry!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Bless my check book!  I'll
speak to Pendergast about your friend. Maybe there'll be a chance to
advance him further. I've got some mortgages falling due pretty soon,
and I'll deposit the money from them in the old bank. Then we'll see
what we can do about Ned."

"They'll make you a bank director, if you keep on putting in money,"
remarked our hero, with a smile.

"Not much they won't!" was the quick answer.

"Bless my stocks and bonds! I've got trouble enough without becoming a
bank director. My doctor says my liver is out of order again, and I've
got to eat a lemon every morning before breakfast."

"Eat a lemon?"

"Well, drink the juice! It's the same thing. But how is the electric
runabout coming on?"

"Pretty good."

"Have you entered it in the races yet?"

"No, but I've written for information. I have until September to finish
it. The races take place then."

"Let's see; they're on Long Island; aren't they? How do you calculate
to do; run from here to there?"

"No, Dad still has the cottage he rented when we built the submarine
and I think I'll make that my headquarters during the race. It's easy
to run from there over to the Long Island track.  They're building a
new one, especially for the occasion.

"Well, I hope you win the prize. I must go to town now, as I have to
attend to some business. I don't s'pose you want to come in my auto.
I'm pretty sure something will break before I get there, and I'd like
to have you along to fix it."

"Sorry, but I'm afraid I can't go," replied the lad. "I must get this
car done, and then I've got to start on the batteries."

Mr. Damon rather reluctantly went off alone, looking anxiously at his
car, for the machine got out of order on every trip he took.

It was a few days after this that Tom received a call from Ned one
evening. The bank employee's face wore a happy smile.

"What's the matter; some one left you a fortune?" asked Tom.

"Pretty nearly as good. I've got a better position."

"What? Have you left the old bank, and gone to the new one?"

"No, I'm still in the same bank, but I'm one of the two cashiers now.
Mr. Foger took several of the old employees when he opened his new
bank, and that left vacancies. I was promoted, and so were one or two
others. Mr. Damon spoke a good word for me."

"That's fine! He's a friend worth having."

"That's right. Your father also recommended me. But how are things with
you? Has Andy made any more trouble?"

"No, and I don't believe he will. I guess he'll steer clear of me."

But Tom was soon to learn he was mistaken.




CHAPTER VII

TOM IS CAPTURED


Meanwhile the young inventor, aided by his father, Mr. Sharp and Garret
Jackson, the engineer, worked hard over his new car, and the powerful
batteries. A month passed, and such was the progress made that Tom felt
justified in making formal entry of his vehicle for the races to be
held by the Touring Club of America.

He paid a contingent fee and was listed as one of the competitors. As
is usual in an affair of this kind, the promoters of it desired
publicity, and they sought it through the papers.

Consequently each new entrant's name was published. In addition
something was said about his previous achievements in the speed line.

No sooner was the name of Tom Swift received by the officials of the
club, than it was at once recalled that young Swift had had a prominent
part in the airship Red Cloud, and the submarine Advance. This gave an
enterprising reporter a chance for a "special" for the Sunday
supplement of a New York newspaper.

Tom, it was stated, was building a car which would practically
annihilate distance and time, and there were many weird pictures,
showing him flying along without touching the ground, in a car, the
pictorial construction of which was at once fearful and wonderful.

Tom and his friends laughed at the yarn, at first, but it soon had
undesirable results. The young inventor had desired to keep secret the
fact that he was building a new electric vehicle, and a novel storage
battery, but the article in the paper aroused considerable interest.
Many persons came a long distance, hoping for a sight of the wonderful
car, as pictured in the Sunday supplement, but they had to be denied.
The news, thus leaking out, kept the Swift shops almost constantly
besieged by many curious ones, who sought, by various means, to gain
admission.  Finally Tom and his father, after posting large signs,
warning persons to keep away, added others to the effect that
undesirable visitors might find themselves unexpectedly shocked by
electricity, if they ventured too close. This had the desired effect,
though the wires which were strung about carried such a mild charge
that it would not have harmed a child. Then the only bothersome
characters were the boys of the town, and, fearless and careless lads,
they persisted in hanging around the Swift homestead, in the hope of
seeing Tom dash away at the rate of five hundred miles an hour, which
one enthusiastic writer predicted he would do.

"I've got a plan!" exclaimed Tom one day when the boys had been
particularly troublesome.

"What is it?" asked his father.

"We'll hire Eradicate Sampson to stand guard with a bucket of
whitewash. He'll keep the boys away."

The plan was put into operation, and Eradicate and his mule, Boomerang,
were installed on the premises.

"Deed an' Ah'll keep dem lads away," promised the colored man.  "Ah'll
splash white stuff all ober 'em, if dey comes traipsin' around me."

He was as good as his word, and, when one or two lads had received a
dose of the stuff, which punishment was followed by more severe from
home, for having gotten their clothes soiled, the nuisance ceased, to a
certain extent. Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey were two who received a
liberal sprinkling of the lime, and they vowed vengeance on Tom.

"And Andy Foger will help us, too," added Sam, as he withdrew, after an
encounter with Eradicate.

"Doan't let dat worry yo', Mistah Swift!" exclaimed the darkey.  "Jest
let dat low-down-good-fo-nuffin' Andy Foger come 'round me, an' Ah'll
make him t'ink he's de inside ob a chicken coop, dat's what Ah will."

Perhaps Andy heard of this, and kept away. In the meanwhile Tom kept on
perfecting his car and battery. From the club secretary he learned that
a number of inventors were working on electric cars, and there promised
to be many of the speedy vehicles in the race.

After considerable labor Tom had succeeded in getting together one set
of the batteries. He had them completed one afternoon, and wanted to
give them a test that night. But, when he went to his father's chemical
laboratory for a certain powder, which he needed to use in the battery
solution, he found there was none.

"I'll have to ride in to Mansburg for some," he decided. "I'll go after
supper, on my motor-cycle, and test the battery to-night."

The young inventor left his house immediately after the evening meal.
Along the road toward Mansburg he speeded, and, as he came to the foot
of a hill, where once Andy Foger had put a big tree, hoping Tom would
run into it and be injured, the youth recalled that circumstance.

"Andy has been keeping out of my way lately," mused Tom. "I wonder if
he's up to any mischief? I don't like the way Sam Snedecker is hanging
around the shop, either. It looks as if they were plotting something.
But I guess Eradicate and his pail of whitewash will scare them off."

Tom got the powdered chemical he wanted in the drug store, and, after
refreshing himself with some ice cream soda, he started back. As he
rode along through the streets of the town he kept a lookout, and those
of you who know how fond the lad was of a certain young lady, do not
need to be told for whom he was looking. But he did not see her, and
soon turned into the main highway leading to Shopton.

It was dark when he reached the hill, where once he had been so near an
accident, and he slowed up as he coasted down it, using the brake at
intervals.

Tom got safely to the bottom of the declivity, and was about to turn on
the power of his machine, when, from the bushes that lined either side
of the roadway, several figures sprang suddenly. They ranged themselves
across the road, and one cried: "Halt!" in tones that were meant to be
stern, but which seemed to Tom, to tremble somewhat. The young inventor
was so surprised that he did not open the gasolene throttle, nor switch
on his spark. As a consequence his motor-cycle lost momentum, and he
had to take one foot from the pedal and touch the ground, to prevent
himself from toppling over.

"Hold on there!" cried another voice. "We've got you where we want you,
now! Hold on! Don't go!"

"I wasn't going to go," responded Tom calmly, trying to recognize the
voice, which seemed to be unnatural. "What do you want, and who are
you?"

"Never mind who we are. We want you and we've got you! Get off that
wheel!"

"I don't see why I should!" exclaimed Tom, and he suddenly shifted his
handle bars, so as to flash the bright headlight he carried, upon the
circle of dark figures that opposed his progress. As the light flashed
on them he was surprised to see that all the figures wore masks over
their faces.

Tom started. Was this the Happy Harry gang after him again? He hoped
not, yet the fact that the persons had on masks made the hold-up have
an ugly look. Once more Tom flashed the light on the throng. There were
exclamations of dismay.

"Douse that glim, somebody!" called a sharp voice, which Tom could not
recognize.

A stone came whizzing through the air, from some one in the crowd.
There was a smashing of glass as it hit the lantern, and the road was
plunged in darkness. Tom tried to throw one leg over the saddle, and
let down the supporting stand from the rear wheel, so the motor-cycle
would remain upright without him holding it. He determined to have
revenge for that act of vandalism in breaking his lamp.

But, just as he was free of the seat, he was surrounded by a dozen
persons, and several hands were laid on him.

"We've got you now!" some one fairly hissed in his ear. "Come along,
and get what's coming to you!"

Tom tried to fight, but he was overpowered by numbers and, a little
later, was dragged off into the woods in the darkness by the masked
figures. His arms were securely bound with ropes, and a handkerchief
was tied over his eyes. Tom Swift was a prisoner.




CHAPTER VIII

A BLINDING FLASH


Stumbling on through the dark woods, led by his captors, Tom tried to
pierce the gloom and identify the persons who had firm grips on either
side of him. But it was useless. A little light sifted down from the
starlit sky above, but it was not sufficient. The young inventor was
beginning to think, after all, that he had fallen into the hands of the
Happy Harry gang, and he knew that if this was so he need expect no
mercy.

But two things were against this belief. One was that the principal
members of the gang were still in jail, or at least they were supposed
to be, and another was that there were too many of the captors. Happy
Harry's crowd never numbered so many.

"Maybe they're highwaymen," thought our hero, as he was dragged along
"But that can't be," he reasoned further. "If they wanted to rob me
they'd have done it back there in the road, and not brought me off here
in the woods. Besides, I haven't anything for them to steal."

Suddenly Tom stumbled over a projecting root, and nearly fell, dragging
along with him the person who had hold of his left arm.

"Look out there! What's the matter with you?" exclaimed one of the
throng quickly, and at the sound of the voice Tom started.

"Andy Foger!" cried the young inventor, as he recovered himself, for he
had recognized the voice of the red-haired bully.  "What do you mean by
holding me up in this way?" he demanded.

"Quiet!" urged a voice in his ear, and the tones were unfamiliar.
"Mention no names!"

"I'm on to your game!" retorted Tom. "I know you're here, Andy, and Sam
and Pete; and Jack Reynolds and Sid Holton," and he named two rather
loose-charactered lads, who were often in the company of Andy and his
cronies. "You'd better quit this nonsense," Tom went on. "I'll cause
the arrest of all of you if you make trouble for me. I know who you are
now!"

"You think you do," answered the voice in his ear, and the young
inventor concluded that it must be some lad whom he did not know. "Nor
is this nonsense," the other went on. "You are about to receive the
punishment due you."

Our hero did not answer, but he was doing some hard thinking.  He
wondered why Andy and his crowd had captured him.

Suddenly the blackness of the woods was illuminated by the fitful gleam
of a distant fire. Tom could see more plainly now, and he managed to
count about ten dusky figures hurrying along, four being close to him,
to prevent his escape, and the others running on ahead. The light
became stronger, and, a moment later the prisoner and his captors
emerged into a little clearing, where a fire was burning. Two figures,
masked with black cloth, as were all in the crowd, stood about the
blaze, putting on sticks of wood.

"Did you get him?" asked one of these figures eagerly.

"Yes, they got me, Sam Snedecker," answered Tom quickly, recognizing
Sam's tones. "And they'll wish they hadn't before I'm done with them."

"Quiet!" ordered an unknown voice. "Members of the Deep Forest Throng,
the prisoner is here!" the lad went on.

"'Tis well, bind the captive to the sacrificial tree," was the response
from some one in the crowd.

Tom laughed. He was at ease now, for he recognized that those who had
taken him prisoner were all lads of Andy's character.  Most of them
were Shopton youths, but some, evidently, were strangers in town. Tom
felt he had little to fear.

"Bring him over here," ordered one, and Tom cried out:

"You wouldn't be giving those orders, Andy Foger, if my arms weren't
tied. And if you'll untie me, I'll fight any two of you at once,"
offered the young inventor fiercely, for he hated the humiliation to
which he was being subjected.

"Don't do it! Don't untie him!" begged some one.

"No danger, they won't. They're afraid to, Pete Bailey," replied Tom
quickly, for he had recognized the voice of the other one of Andy's
particular cronies.

"Aw, he knows who we are," whispered Sam, but not so low but that our
hero heard him.

"No matter," was Andy's retort. "Let's go ahead with it. Tie him to
that tree."

It was useless for Tom to struggle. He was bound too tightly by the
rope, and the crowd was too many for him. In a few minutes he was
securely fastened to a tree, not far from the camp-fire, which was
replenished from time to time.

"Now for the judgment!" called one of the masked lads, in what he meant
to be a sepulchral tone. "What is the charge against the prisoner?
Brother Number One of the Deep Forest Throng, what is your accusation?"

"He's a regular snob, that's what's the trouble,"  answered Andy
Foger,  though whether he was "Brother Number One," did not appear.
"He's too fresh and--and--"

"I'll make you wish you felt fresh when I get hold of you, Andy,"
murmured Tom.

"Quiet!" cried a tall lad. "What's the next charge?"

"He keeps an old colored man on guard at his place," was the answer,
and Tom had no difficulty in recognizing the voice of Sid Holton. "The
coon throws whitewash all over us. I got some of it."

"You wouldn't have, if you'd minded your own business," retorted Tom.
"It served you right!"

"What is the verdict on the prisoner?" asked one who seemed to be the
leader.

"I say let's tar and feather him!" cried Andy suddenly.  "There's a
barrel of tar back in the woods here, and we can get some feathers from
a chicken coop. That would make him so he wouldn't be so uppish, I
guess!"

"That's right! Tar and feathers!" exclaimed several.

Our hero's heart sank. He was not afraid, but he did not relish the
indignity that was proposed. He resolved to fight to the last ounce of
his strength against the masked lads.

"Can we get a kettle to heat the tar in?" asked some one.

"We'll find one," answered Sam Snedecker. "Come on, let's do it. You'll
look pretty, Tom Swift, when we're through with you," he exulted.

Tom did not answer, but there was fierce anger in his heart.  The tar
and feather proposal seemed to meet with general favor.

"Members of the Deep Forest Throng, we will hold a consultation,"
proposed the leader, in his assumed deep voice.  "Come over here, to
one side. Brother Number Six, guard the prisoner well."

"There ain't no need to," answered a lad who had been instructed to
mount guard over Tom. "He's tied so tight he can't move. I want to hear
what you say."

"Very well then," assented the leader,  "But look to his bonds."

The lad made a hasty examination of the ropes binding the young
inventor to the tree, and Tom was glad that the examination was a hasty
one. For he feared the guard might discover that one hand had been
worked nearly free. The young inventor had done this while he leered at
his captors.

Tom was not going to submit tamely to the nonsense, and from the moment
he had been tied, he had been trying to get loose. He had nearly
succeeded in freeing one hand when the crowd of masked boys moved off
to one side, where they presently began to talk in excited whispers.

"I wonder how they came to catch me," thought the prisoner, as he
worked feverishly to further loosen the ropes. "This looks as if it was
a put-up job, with the masks, and everything."  Later he learned that
the idea was the outcome of a proposal of one of the new arrivals in
town. He had organized the "Deep Forest Throng," as a sort of secret
society, and Andy and his cronies had been induced to join. It was
Andy's proposal to capture Tom, though, and, having seen him depart for
Mansburg on his motor-cycle, and knowing that he would return along a
road that ran near the woods where the Throng met, suggested that they
take Tom captive. The idea was enthusiastically received, and Andy and
his cronies thought they saw a chance to be revenged.

Tom, while he picked at the ropes, listened to what the boys were
saying. He heard frequent mention of tar and feathers, and began to
believe, that unless he could get free, while they were off there
consulting, he might be forced to submit to the humiliating ordeal.

He managed to get one hand comparatively free, so that he could move it
about, but then he struck several hard knots, and could make no further
progress. The conference seemed on the point of breaking up.

"One of you go for a big kettle to boil the tar in," ordered the
leader, "and the rest of you dig up some feathers."

"I must get loose!" thought Tom desperately. "If they try to tar and
feather me it will be a risky business. I've got to get loose! They may
burn me severely!"

But, though he tried with all his strength, the ropes would not loosen
another bit. He had one hand free, and that was all. The crowd was
moving back toward him.

"My knife!" thought the captive quickly. "If I can reach that in my
pocket I can cut the ropes! Once I get loose I'll fight the whole
crowd!"

He managed to get his free hand into his pocket. His fingers touched
something. It was not his knife, and, for a moment he felt a pang of
disappointment. Then, as he realized what it was that he had grasped, a
new idea came to him.

"This will be better than the knife!" he thought exultantly.  The crowd
of lads was now surrounding him, some distance from the fire, which
burned in front of the captive.

"Sentence has been passed upon you," remarked the leader.  "Prepare to
meet thy doom! Get the materials, brothers!"

"One moment!" called Tom, for he wanted the crowd all present to
witness what he was about to do. "I'll give you one chance to let me go
peaceably. If you don't--"

"Well, what will you do?" demanded Andy sneeringly, as he pulled his
mask further over his face. "I guess you won't do anything, Tom Swift."

"I'll give you one chance to let me go, and I'll agree to say nothing
about this joke," went on Tom. "If you don't I'll blow this place up!"

For a moment there was a silence.

"Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho!" laughed Sam Snedecker. "Listen to him! He'll blow the
place up! I'd like to see you do it! You can't get loose in the first
place, and you haven't anything to blow it up with in the second. I'd
like to see you do it; hey, fellers?"

"Sure," came the answering chorus.

"Would you?" asked Tom quickly. "Then watch. Stand back if you don't
want to get hurt, and remember that I gave you a chance to let me go!"

Tom made a rapid motion with the hand he had gotten loose. He threw
something toward the blazing fire, which was now burning well.
Something white sailed through the air, and fell amid the hot embers.

There was a moment's pause, and then a blinding flash of blue fire
lighted up the woods, and a dull rumble, as when gun-powder is lighted
in the open followed. A great cloud of white smoke arose, as the vivid
blue glare died away, and it seemed as if a great wind swept over the
place. Several of the masked lads were knocked down by the explosion,
and when the rumble died away, and deep blackness succeeded the intense
blue light, there came cries of pain and terror. The fire had been
scattered, and extinguished by the explosion which Tom, though still
bound to the tree had caused to happen in the midst of the Deep Forest
Throng. Then, as the smoke rolled away, Andy Foger cried:

"Come on, fellows! Something's happened. I guess a volcano blew up!"




CHAPTER IX

TOM IS RESCUED


The Deep Forest Throng needed no urging to flee from the place of the
mysterious explosion. Their prisoner, helpless as he had seemed, had
proved too much for them. Slipping and stumbling along in the darkness,
the masked lads had but one thought--to get away before they saw more
of that blue fire, and the force of the concussion.

"Gee! My eyebrows are all singed off!" cried Sam Snedecker, as he tore
loose his mask which had been rent in the explosion, and felt of his
face.

"And my hands are burned," added Pete Bailey. "I stood closer to the
fire than any of you."

"You did not! I got the worst of it!" cried Andy. "I was knocked down
by the explosion, and I'll bet I'm hurt somewhere. I guess--Oh! Help!
I'm falling in a mud hole!"

There was a splash, and the bully disappeared from the sight of his
companions who, now that the moon had risen, could better see to flee
from their prisoner.

"Help me out, somebody!" pleaded Andy. "I'm in a mud hole!"

They pulled him out, a sorry looking sight, and the red-haired lad,
whose locks were now black with muck, began to lament his lot.

"Dry up!" commanded Sid Holton. "It's all your fault, for proposing
such a fool trick as capturing Tom Swift. We might have known he would
get the best of us."

"What was that stuff he used, anyhow?" asked Cecil Hedden, the lad
responsible for the organization of the Deep Forest Throng.  "He must
be a wonder. Does he do sleight-of-hand tricks?"

"He does all sorts of tricks," replied Pete Bailey, feeling of a big
lump on his head, caused by falling on a stone in the mad rush. "I
guess we were chumps to tackle him. He must have put some kind of
chemical in the fire, to make it blow up."

"Or else he summoned his airship by wireless, and had that balloonist,
Mr. Sharp, drop a bomb in the blaze," suggested another lad.

"But how could he do anything? Wasn't he tied fast to that tree?" asked
Cecil, the leader.

"You never know when you've got Tom Swift tied," declared Jack
Reynolds. "You think you've got him, and you haven't. He's too slick
for us. It's Andy's fault, for proposing to capture him."

"That's right! Blame it all on me," whined the squint-eyed bully. "You
was just as anxious as I was to tar and feather him."

"Well, we didn't do it," commented Pete Bailey, dryly. "I s'pose he's
loose now, laughin' at us. Gee, but that was an explosion though! It's
a wonder some of us weren't killed! I guess I've had enough of this
Deep Forest Throng business. No more for mine."

"Aw, don't be afraid," urged Cecil. "The next time we get him we'll be
on our guard."

"You'll never catch Tom Swift again," predicted Pete.

"I'll go back now to where he is, if you will," agreed Cecil, who was
older than the others.

"Not much!" cried Pete. "I've had enough."

This seemed to be the sentiment of all. Away they stumbled through the
woods, and, emerging on the road, scattered to their several homes, not
one but who suffered from slight burns, contusions, torn and muddy
clothes or injured feelings as the outcome of the "joke" on the young
inventor.

But our hero was not yet free from the bonds of his enemies.  When they
scattered and ran, after the vivid blue light, and the dull explosion,
which, being unconfined, did no real damage, Tom was still fast to the
tree. As his eyes became accustomed to the semi-darkness that followed
the glare, he remarked:

"Well, I don't know that I'm much better off. I gave those fellows a
good scare, but I'm not loose. But I can work to better advantage now."

Once more he resumed the effort to free himself, but in spite of the
crude manner in which the knots had been made, the lad could not get
loose. The more he pulled and tugged the tighter they seemed to become.

"This is getting serious," Tom mused. "If I could only reach my knife I
could cut them, but it's in my pocket on the other side, and that
bond's fast. Guess I'll have to stay here all night.  Maybe I'd better
call for help, but--"

His words, spoken half aloud, were suddenly interrupted by a crash in
the underbrush. Somebody was approaching. At first Tom thought it was
Andy and his cronies coming back, but a voice that called a moment
later proved that this was not so.

"Is any one here?" shouted a man. "Any one hurt? What was that fire and
explosion?"

"I'm here," replied Tom. "I'm not hurt exactly, but I'm tied to a tree.
I'll be much obliged if you'll loosen me."

"Who are you?"

"Tom Swift. Is that you, Mr. Mason?"

"Yes. By jinks! I never expected to find you here, Tom. Over this way,
men," he added calling aloud. "I've found him; it's Tom Swift."

There was the flicker of several lanterns amid the trees, and soon a
number of men had joined Mr. Mason, and surrounded Tom.  They were
farmers living in the neighborhood.

"What in the name o' Tunket happened?" asked one. "Did you get hit by a
meteor or a comet? Who tied you up; highwaymen?"

"Cut him loose first, and ask questions afterward," suggested Mr. Mason.

"Yes," added Tom, with a laugh, "I wish you would. I'm beginning to
feel cramped."

With their knives, the farmers quickly cut the ropes, and some of them
rubbed the arms of the lad to restore the circulation.

"What was it--highwaymen?" asked a man, unable to longer restrain his
curiosity. "Did they rob you?"

"No, it wasn't highwaymen," replied the youth. "It was a trick of some
boys I know," and to Tom's credit be it said that he did not mention
their names. "They did it for a joke," he added.

"Boys' trick? Joke?" queried Mr. Mason. "Pretty queer sort of a joke, I
think. They ought to be arrested."

"Oh, I fancy I gave them what was coming to them," went on the young
inventor.

"Did they try to blow ye up, too?" asked Mr. Hertford. "What in th'
name of Tunket was that blue light, and that explosion? I heard it an'
saw it way over to my house."

"So did I," remarked Mr. Mason, and several others said the same thing.
"We thought a meteor had fallen," he continued, "and we got together to
make an investigation."

"It's a good thing for me you did," admitted Tom, "or I might have had
to stay here all night."

"But was it a meteor?" insisted Mr. Hertford.

"No," replied the lad, "I did it."

"You?"

"Yes. You see after they tied me I found I could get one hand free. I
reached in my pocket for my knife, but instead of it I managed to get
hold of a package of powder I had."

"Gunpowder?" asked Mr. Mason.

"No, a chemical powder I use in an electrical battery. The powder
explodes in fire, and makes quite a blue flash, and a lot of smoke, but
it isn't very dangerous, otherwise I wouldn't have used it. When the
boys were some distance away from the fire, I threw the powder in the
blaze. It went off in a moment, and--"

"I guess they run some; didn't they?" asked Mr. Mason with a laugh.

"They certainly did," agreed Tom.




CHAPTER X

TOM HAS A FALL


The young inventor told more details of his adventure in the woods,
but, though the farmers questioned him closely, he would not give a
single name of his assailants.

"But I should think you'd want to have them punished," remarked Mr.
Mason.

"I'll attend to that part later," answered Tom. "Besides, most of them
didn't know what they were doing. They were led on by one or two. No,
I'll fight my own battles. But I wish you'd lend me a lantern long
enough to find my motor-cycle. The moon doesn't give much light in the
woods, and those fellows may have hidden my machine."

Mr. Mason and his companions readily agreed to accompany Tom on a
search for his wheel. It was found just where he had dismounted from it
in the road. Andy and his cronies had evidently had enough of their
encounter with our hero, and did not dare to annoy him further.

"Do you think you can ride home?" asked one of the farmers of the lad,
when he had ascertained that his machine was in running order.

"Well, it's risky without my lantern," answered Tom. "They smashed that
for me. But I guess I can manage."

"No, you can't!" insisted Mr. Mason. "You're stiff from being tied up;
and you can't ride. Now you just wheel that contraption over to my
place, and I'll hitch up and take you home. It isn't far."

"Oh, I couldn't think of troubling you," declared Tom. At the same time
he felt that he was in no condition to ride.

"It's no trouble at all," insisted Mr. Mason. "I guess your father and
I are good enough friends to allow me to have my way.  You can come
over and get your choo-choo bicycle in the morning."

A little later Tom was being rapidly driven toward his home, where he
found his father and Mrs. Baggert, to say nothing of Mr. Sharp,
somewhat alarmed over his absence, as it was getting late.  The youth
told as much of his adventure as he thought would not alarm his father,
making a sort of joke of it, and, later, related all the details to the
balloonist.

"We'll have to get after Andy again," declared the aeronaut.  "He needs
another toning down."

"Yes, similar to the one he got when we nearly ran away with his
automobile, by catching the airship anchor on it," added Tom with a
laugh. "But I fancy Andy will steer clear of me for a while. I'm sorry
I had to use up that chemical powder, though.  Now I can't start my
battery until to-morrow." But the next day Tom made up for lost time,
by working from early until late. He went over to Mr. Mason's, got his
motor-cycle, procured some more of the chemical, and soon had his
storage battery in running order. Then he arranged for a more severe
test, and while that was going on he worked at completing the body of
the electric runabout. The vehicle was beginning to look like a car,
though it was not of the regulation pattern.

For the next week Tom was very busy, so occupied, in fact, that he
scarcely took time for his meals, which caused Mrs. Baggert no little
worriment, for she was a housekeeper who liked to see others enjoy her
cooking.

"Well, Tom, how are you coming on?" asked his father one night, as they
sat on the porch, Mr. Sharp with them.

"Pretty well, Dad," was the answer of the young inventor. "I'll put the
wheels on to-morrow, and then set the batteries. I've got the motor all
finished; and all I'll have to do will be to connect it up, and then
I'll be ready for a trial on the road."

"And you still think you'll beat all records?"

"I'm pretty sure of it, Dad. You see the amperage will be exceptionally
high, and my batteries will have a large amount of reserve, with little
internal resistance. But do you know I'm so tired I can hardly think.
It's more of a job than I thought it would be."

Tom, a little later, strolled down the road. As he turned back toward
the house and walked up the shrubbery lined path he heard a noise.

"Some one's hiding in there!" thought the lad, and he darted to an
opening in the hedge to reach the other side. As he did so he saw a
figure running away. Whether it was a man or a boy he could not tell in
the darkness.

"Hold on there!" cried the young inventor, but, naturally, the fleeing
one did not stop. Tom began to sprint, and as it was slightly down
hill, he made good time. The figure ahead of him was running well, too,
but Tom who could see better, now that he was out from under the trees,
noticed that he was gaining. The fleeing one came to a little brook,
and hesitated a moment before leaping across. This enabled Tom to catch
up, and he made a grab for the figure, just as the man or boy sprang
across the little stream.

Tom missed his grip, but he was not going to give up. He scarcely
slackened his speed, but, with the momentum he had acquired in racing
down the hill, he, too, leaped across the brook. As he landed on the
other side he made another grab for the figure, a man, as Tom could now
see, but he could make out no features, as the person's hat was pulled
down over his face.

"I've got you now!" cried Tom exultantly, reaching out his hand. His
fingers clutched something, but the next instant the young inventor
went sprawling. The other had put out his foot, and tripped him neatly
and, Tom throwing out his hands to save himself in the fall that was
inevitable, went splashing into the brook at full length. The unknown,
pausing a moment to view what he had done, turned quickly and raced off
in the darkness.




CHAPTER XI

CROSSED WIRES


More surprised than hurt, and with a feeling of chagrin and anger at
the trick which had been played on him, Tom managed to scramble out of
the brook. The water was not deep, but he had splashed in with such
force that he was wet all over. And, as he got up, the water dripping
from his clothes, the lad was conscious of a pain in his head. He put
up his hand, and found that contact with a stone had raised a large
lump on his forehead. It was as big as a hen's egg.

"Humph! I'll be a pretty sight to-morrow," murmured Tom. "I wonder who
that fellow was, anyhow, and what he wanted? He tripped me neatly
enough, whoever he was. I've a good notion to keep on after him."

Then, as he realized what a start the fleeing one had, the young
inventor knew that it would be fruitless to renew the chase. Slowly he
ascended the sloping bank, and started for home.  As he did so he
realized that he had, clasped in his fingers, something he had grabbed
from the person he was pursuing just before his unlucky tumble.

"It's part of his watch chain!" exclaimed Tom, as he felt of the
article. "I must have ripped it loose when I fell. Wonder what it is?
Evidently some sort of a charm. Maybe it will be a clue."  He tried to
discern of what style it was, but in the dark woods this was
impossible. Then the lad tried to strike a match, but those in his
pocket had become wet from his unexpected bath.  "I'll have to wait
until I get home," he went on, and he hastened his steps, for he was
anxious to see what he had torn loose from the person who appeared to
be spying on him.

"Why Tom, what's the matter?" exclaimed Mrs. Baggert, when he entered
the kitchen, dripping water at every step. "Is it raining outside? I
didn't hear any storm."

"It was raining where I was," replied Tom angrily. "I fell in the
brook. It was so hot I thought I'd cool off."

"With your best suit on!" ejaculated the housekeeper.

"It isn't my best," retorted the lad. "But I went in before I thought.
It was an accident; I fell," he added, lest Mrs. Baggert take his
joking remarks seriously. He did not want to tell her of the chase.

The chief concern of the lad now was to look at the charm and, as soon
as Mrs. Baggert's attention was attracted elsewhere, Tom glanced at the
object he still held tightly clenched in his hand.  As the light from
the kitchen fell upon it he could hardly repress an exclamation of
astonishment.

For the charm that he held in his hand was one he had seen before
dangling from the watch chain of Addison Berg, the agent for Bentley &
Eagert, submarine boat builders, which firm had, as told in "Tom Swift
and His Submarine," tried unsuccessfully to secure the gold treasure
from the sunken wreck. Berg and his associates had even gone so far as
to try to disable the Advance, the boat of Tom and his father, by
ramming her when deep down under the ocean, but Mr. Swift's use of an
electric cannon had broken the steering gear of the Wonder, the rival
craft, and from that time on Tom and his friends had a clear field to
search for the bullion held fast in the hold of the Boldero. "Addison
Berg," murmured Tom, as he looked at the watch charm. "What can he be
doing in this neighborhood? Hiding, too, as if he wanted to overhear
something. That's the way he did when we were building our submarine,
and now he's up to the same trick when I'm constructing my electric
car. I'm sure this charm is his. It is such a peculiar design that I'm
positive I can't be mistaken. I thought, when I was chasing after him,
that it would turn out to be Andy Foger, or some of the boys, but it
was too big for them.  Addison Berg, eh? What can he be doing around
here? I must not tell Dad, or he'd worry himself sick. But I must be on
my guard."

Tom examined the charm closely. It was a compass, but made in an odd
form, and was much ornamented.

The young inventor had noticed it on several occasions when he had been
in conversation with Mr. Berg previous to the attempt on the part of
the owners of the rival submarine to wreck Tom's boat. He felt that he
could not be mistaken in identifying the charm.

"Berg was afraid I'd catch him, and ask for an explanation that would
have been awkward to make," thought the lad, as he turned the charm
over in his hand. "That's why he tripped me up. But I'll get at the
bottom of this yet. Maybe he wants to steal my ideas for an electric
car."

Tom's musings were suddenly interrupted by Mrs. Baggert.

"I hope you're not going to stand there all night," she said, with a
laugh. "You're in the middle of a puddle now, but when you get over
dreaming I'd like to mop it up."

"All right," agreed the young inventor, coming to himself suddenly.
"Guess I'd better go get some dry clothes on."

"You'd better go to bed," advised Mrs. Baggert. "That's where your
father and Mr. Sharp are. It's late."

The more Tom thought over the strange occurrence the more it puzzled
him. He mused over the presence of Berg as he went about his work the
next day, for that it was the agent whom he had pursued he felt
positive.

"But I can't figure out why he was hanging around here," mused Tom.

Then, as he found that his thoughts over the matter were interfering
with his work, he resolutely put them from him, and threw himself
energetically into the labor of completing his electric car. The new
batteries, he found, were working well, and in the next two days he had
constructed several more, joining them so as to get the combined effect.

It was the afternoon of the third day from Tom's unexpected fall into
the brook that the young inventor decided on the first important test
of his new device. He was going to try the motor, running it with his
storage battery. Some of the connections were already in place, the
wires being fastened to the side of the shop, where they were attached
to switches. Tom did not go over these, taking it for granted that they
were all right. He soon had the motor, which he was to install in his
car, wired to the battery, and then he attached a gauge, to ascertain,
by comparison, how many miles he could hope to travel on one charging
of the storage battery.

"Guess I'll call Dad and Mr. Sharp in to see how it works, before I
turn on the current," he said to himself. He was about to summon his
parent and the aeronaut from an adjoining shop, where they were working
over a new form of dynamo, when the lad caught sight of the watch charm
he had left on his desk, in plain sight.

"Better put that away," he remarked. "Dad or Mr. Sharp might see it,
and ask questions. Then I'd have to explain, and I don't want to, not
until I get further toward the bottom of this thing."

He put the charm away, and then summoned his father and the balloonist.

"You're going to see a fine experiment," declared Tom. "I'm going to
turn on the full strength of my battery."

"Are you sure it's all right, Tom?" asked his father. "You can't be too
careful when you're dealing with electricity of high voltage, and great
ampere strength.

"Oh, it's all right, Dad," his son assured him "Now watch my motor hum."

He walked over to a big copper switch, and grasped the black rubber
handle to pull it over which would send the current from the storage
battery into the combination of wheels and gears that he hoped,
ultimately, would propel his electric automobile along the highways, or
on a track, at the rate of a hundred miles an hour.

"Here she goes!" cried Tom. For an instant he hesitated and then pulled
the switch. At the same time his hand rested on another wire, stretched
across a bench.

No sooner had the switch closed than there was a blinding flash, a
report as of a gun being fired, and Tom's body seemed to straighten
out. Then a blue flame appeared to encircle him and he dropped to the
floor of the shop, an inert mass.

"He's killed!" cried Mr. Swift, springing forward.

"Careful!" cautioned the balloonist. "He's been shocked! Don't touch
him until I turn off the current!"  As he pulled out the switch, the
aeronaut gave a glance at the apparatus.

"There's something wrong here!" he cried. "The wires have been crossed!
That's what shocked Tom, but he never made the wrong connections! He's
too good an electrician! There's been some one in this shop, changing
the wires!"




CHAPTER XII

THE TRY OUT


Once the current was cut off it was safe to approach the body of the
young inventor. Mr. Sharp stooped over and lifted Tom's form from the
floor, for Mr. Swift was too excited and trembled too much to be of any
service. Our hero was as one dead. His body was limp, after that first
rigid stretching out, as the current ran through him; his eyes were
closed, and his face was very pale.

"Is--is there any hope?" faltered Mr. Swift.

"I think so," replied the balloonist. "He is still breathing--faintly.
We must summon a doctor at once. Will you telephone for one, while I
carry him in the house?"

As Mr. Sharp emerged from the shop, bearing Tom's body, an automobile
drew up in front of the place.

"Bless my soul!" exclaimed a voice. "Tom's hurt! How did it happen?
Bless my very existence!"

"Oh, Mr. Damon, you're just in time!" exclaimed Mr. Sharp, "Tom's had a
bad shock. Will you go for a doctor in your auto?"

"Better than that! Let me take Tom in the car to Dr. Whiteside's
office," proposed the eccentric man. "It will be better that way."

"Yes, yes," agreed Mr. Swift eagerly. "Put Tom in the auto!"

"If only it doesn't break down," added Mr. Damon fervently.  "Bless my
spark plug, but it would be just my luck!"

But they started off all right, Mr. Swift riding in front with Mr.
Damon, and Mr. Sharp supporting Tom in the tonneau. Only a little
fluttering of the eyelids, and a slow, faint breathing told that Tom
Swift still lived.

Mr. Damon never guided a car better than he did his auto that day.
Several speed laws were broken, but no one appeared to stop them, and,
in record time they had the young inventor at the physician's house.
Fortunately Dr. Whiteside was at home, and, under his skillful
treatment Tom was soon out of danger. His heart action was properly
started, and then it was only a question of time. As the doctor had
plenty of room it was decided to let the lad remain that night, and Tom
was soon installed in a spare bedroom, with the doctor's pretty
daughter to wait on him occasionally.

"Oh, I'm all right," the youth insisted, when Miss Whiteside told him
it was time for his medicine. "I'm all right."

"You're not!" she declared. "I ought to know, for I'm going to be a
nurse, some day, and help papa. Now take this or I'll have to hold your
nose, as they do the baby's," and she held out a spoonful of unpleasant
looking mixture, extending her dainty forefinger and thumb of her other
hand, as if to administer dire punishment to Tom, if he did not obey.

"Well, I give in to superior strength," he said with a laugh, as he
noted, with approval, the laughing face of his nurse.

Then he fell into a deep sleep, and was so much better the next morning
that he could be taken home in Mr. Damon's auto.

"But mind, no hard work for three or four days," insisted the
physician. "I want your heart to get in shape for that big race you
were telling me about. The shock was a severe strain to it."

Tom promised, reluctantly, and, though he did no work, his first act,
on reaching home, was to go out to the shop, to inspect the battery and
motor. To his surprise the motor was running for the lad had
established the connection, in spite of his shock and his father and
Mr. Sharp had decided to let the machinery run until he came back.

"And look at the record it's made!" cried Tom delightedly as he glanced
at the gauge. "Better than I figured on. That battery is a wonder. I'll
have the fastest electric runabout you ever saw."

"If the wires don't get crossed again," put in Mr. Sharp.  "You'd
better make an examination, Tom," and, for the first time, the young
inventor learned how he had been shocked.

"Crossed wires! I should say they were crossed!" he exclaimed as he
looked at the switches and copper conductors. "Somebody has been
tampering with them. No wonder I was shocked!"

"Who did it?" asked Mr. Sharp.

Tom considered for a moment, before answering. Then he said:

"I believe it was Addison Berg. He must have wanted to do some damage,
to get even with us for getting that treasure away from him."

"Berg?" questioned the balloonist, and Tom told of the night he had
been tripped into the brook, and exhibited the watch charm he had
secured. Mr. Sharp recognized it at once. A further examination
confirmed the belief that the submarine agent had sneaked into Tom's
workshop, and had altered the wires.

"They were all right when I came out of the shop that night," declared
Tom. "I left the old connections just as I thought I had arranged them,
and only added the new ones, when I went to try my battery. The old
connections were crossed, but I didn't notice it. Then when I turned on
the current I got the shock. I don't s'pose Berg thought I'd be so
nearly killed. Probably he wanted to burn out my motor, and spoil it.
If it was Andy Foger I could understand it, but a man like Berg--"

"He's probably wild with anger because his submarine got the worst of
it in the race for the gold," interrupted the balloonist. "Well, we'll
have to be on our guard, that's all.  What was the matter with
Eradicate, that he didn't see him enter the shop?"

"Rad went to a colored dance that night," said Tom. "I let him off. But
after this I'll have the shop guarded night and day. My motor might
have been ruined, if that first charge hadn't gone through my body
instead of into the machinery."  The improper connections were soon
removed and others substituted.

It was agreed between Tom and Mr. Sharp that they would say nothing
regarding Mr. Berg to Mr. Swift. The aeronaut caused cautious inquiries
to be made, and learned that the agent had been discharged by the
submarine firm, because of some wrong-doing in connection with the
craft Wonder, and it was surmised that the agent believed Tom to be at
the bottom of his troubles.

In a few days the young inventor was himself again, and as further
trials of his battery showed it to be even better than its owner hoped,
arrangements were made for testing it in the car on the road.

The runabout was nearly finished, but it lacked a coat of varnish, and
some minor details, when Tom, assisted by his father, Mr. Sharp and Mr.
Jackson, one morning, about a week later, installed the motor and
battery units. It did not take long to gear up the machinery, connect
the battery and, though the car was rather a crude looking affair, Tom
decided to give it a tryout.

"Want to come along, Dad?" he asked, as he tightened up some binding
posts, and looked to see that the steering wheel, starting and reverse
levers worked properly, and that the side chains were well lubricated.

"Not the first time," replied his father. "Let's see how it runs with
you, first."

"Oh, I want some sort of a load in it," went on the lad. "It won't be a
good test unless I have a couple of others besides myself. How about
you, Mr. Damon?" for the old gentleman was spending a few days at the
Swift homestead.

"Bless my shoe buttons! I'll come!" was the ready answer.  "After the
experience I've been through in the airship and submarine, nothing can
scare me. Lead on, I'll follow!"

"I don't suppose you'll hang back after that; will you, Mr. Sharp?"
asked the lad, with a laugh.

"I don't dare to, for the sake of my reputation," was the reply, for
the balloonist who had made many ascensions, and dropped thousands of
feet in parachutes, was naturally a brave man.

So he and Mr. Damon climbed into the rear seats of the odd-looking
electric car, while Tom took his place at the steering wheel.

"Are you all ready?" he asked.

"Let her go!" fired back Mr. Sharp.

"Bless my galvanometer, don't go too fast on the start," cautioned Mr.
Damon, nervously.

"I'll not," agreed the young inventor. "I want to get it warmed up
before I try any speeding."

He turned on the current. There was a low, humming purr, which
gradually increased to a whine, and the car moved slowly forward.  It
rolled along the gravel driveway to the road, Tom listening to every
sound of the machinery, as a mother listens to the breathing of a child.

"She's moving!" he cried.

"But not much faster than a wheelbarrow," said his father, who
sometimes teased his son.

"Wait!" cried the youth.

Tom turned more current into the motor. The purring and humming
increased, and the car seemed to leap forward. It was in the road now,
and, once assured that the steering apparatus was working well, Tom
suddenly turned on much more speed.

So quickly did the electric auto shoot forward that Mr. Damon and Mr.
Sharp were jerked back against the cushions of the rear seats.

"Here! What are you doing?" inquired Mr. Sharp.

"I'm going to show you a little speed," answered Tom.

The car was now moving rapidly, and there was a smoothness and
lightness to its progress that was absent from a gasolene auto.  There
was no vibration from the motor. Faster and faster it ran, until it was
moving at a speed scarcely less than that of Mr. Damon's car, when it
was doing its best. Of course that was not saying much, for the car
owned by the odd gentleman was not a very powerful one, but it could
make fast time occasionally.

"Is this the best you can do?" asked Mr. Damon. "Not that it isn't
fast," he hastened to add, "and I was wondering if it was your limit."

"Not half!" cried Tom, as he turned on a little more power.  "I'm not
trying for a record to-day. I just want to see how the battery and
motor behaves."

"Pretty well, I should say," commented Mr. Sharp.

"I'm satisfied--so far," agreed the lad.

They were now moving along the highway at a good speed--moving almost
silently, too, for the motor, save for a low hum, made no noise. So
quiet was the car, in fact, that it was nearly the cause of a disaster.
Tom was so interested in the performance of his latest invention, that,
before he knew it, he had come up behind a farmer, driving a team of
skittish horses. As the big machine went past them, giving no warning
of its approach, the steeds reared up, and would have bolted, but for
the prompt action of the driver.

"Hey!" he cried, angrily, as Tom speeded past, "don't you know you got
to give warnin' when you're comin' with one of them ther gol-swizzled
things! By Jehossephat I'll have th' law on ye ef ye do thet ag'in!"

"I forgot to ring the bell," apologized Tom, as he sent out a peal from
the gong, and then, he let out a few more amperes, and the speed
increased.

"Hold on! I guess this is fast enough!" cried Mr. Damon, as his hat
blew off.

"Fast?" answered Tom. "This is nothing to what I'll do when I use the
full power. Then I'll--"

He was interrupted by a sharp report, and a vivid flash of fire on a
switch board near the steering wheel. The motor gave a sort of groan,
and stopped, the car rolling on a little way, and then becoming
stationary.

"Bless my collar button!" ejaculated Mr. Damon.

"What's the matter?" inquired Mr. Sharp.

"Some sort of a blow-out," answered Tom ruefully, as he shoved the
starting handle over, trying to move the car. But it would not budge.
The new auto had "gone dead" on her first tryout. The young inventor
was grievously disappointed.




CHAPTER XIII

TOWED BY A MULE


"Bless my gizzard! Is it anything serious?" asked Mr. Damon.  "Will it
blow up, or anything like that?"

"No," replied the lad, as he leaped out of the car, and began to make
an examination. Mr. Sharp assisted him.

"The motor seems to be all right," remarked the balloonist, as he
inspected it.

"Yes," agreed our hero, "and the batteries have plenty of power left in
them yet. The gauge shows that. I can't understand what the trouble can
be, unless--" He paused in his remark and uttered an exclamation. "I've
found it!" he cried.

"What?" demanded the aeronaut.

"Some of the fuses blew out. I turned on too much current, and the
fuses wouldn't carry it. I put them in to save the motor from being
burned out, but I didn't use heavy enough ones. I see where my mistake
was."

"But what does it mean?" inquired Mr. Damon.

"It means that we've got to walk back home," was Tom's sorrowful
answer. "The car is stalled, for I haven't any extra fuses with me."

"Can't you connect up the battery by using some extra wire?" asked Mr.
Sharp. "I have some," and he drew a coil of it from his pocket.

"I wouldn't dare to. It might be so heavy that it would carry more
current than the motor could stand. I don't want to burn that out. No,
I guess we'll have to walk home, or rather I will.  You two can stay
here until I come back with heavier fuses. I'm sorry."

Tom had hardly ceased speaking, when, from around the turn in the road
proceeded a voice, and, at the sound of it all three started, for the
voice was saying:

"Now it ain't no use fer yo' to act dat-a-way, Boomerang. Yo' all ain't
got no call t' git contrary now, jest when I wants t' git home t' mah
dinner. I should t'ink you'd want t' git t' de stable, too. But ef yo'
all ain't mighty keerful I'll cut down yo' rations, dat's what I'se
goin' to do. G'lang, now, dat's a good feller. Ho! Ho! I knowed dat'd
fetch yo' all. When yo' all wiggles yo' ears dat-a-way, dat's a suah
sign yo' all is gwine t' move."

Then followed the sound of a rattletrap of a wagon approaching.

"Eradicate! It's Eradicate!" exclaimed Tom.

"And his mule, Boomerang!" added Mr. Sharp. "He's just in time!"
commented Mr. Damon with a sigh of relief, as the ancient outfit, in
charge of the aged colored man, came along. Eradicate had been sent to
Shopton to get a load of wood for Mr. Swift, and was now returning. At
the sight of the stalled auto the mule pricked up his long ears, and
threw them forward.

"Whoa dar, now, Boomerang!" cried Eradicate. "Doan't yo' all commence
t' gittin' skittish. Dat machine ain't gwine t' hurt yo'. Why good
land a' massy! Ef 'tain't Mistah Swift!" cried the colored man, as he
caught sight of Tom. "What's de trouble?" he asked.

"Broke down," answered the young inventor briefly. "You always seem to
come along when I'm in trouble, Rad."

"Dat's right," assented the darkey, with a grin. "Me an' trouble am ole
acquaintances. Sometimes she hits me a clip on de haid, den, ag'in
Boomerang, mah mule, gits it. He jest had his trouble. Got a stone
under his shoe, an' didn't want t' move. Den when I did git him started
he balked on me. But I'se all right now. But I suah am sorry fo' you.
Can't I help yo' all, Mistah Swift?"

"Yes, you can, Rad," answered Tom. "Drive home as fast as you can, and
ask Dad to send back with you some of those fuses he'll find on my work
bench. He knows what I want. Hurry there and hurry back."

Eradicate shook his head doubtfully.

"What's the matter? Don't you want to go?" asked Mr. Sharp, a trifle
nettled. "We can't get the car started until we have some new fuses."

"Oh, I wants t' go all right 'nuff, Mistah Sharp," was Eradicate's
prompt answer. "Yo' all knows I'd do anyt'ing t' 'blige yo' or Mistah
Swift. But hits dish yeah mule, Boomerang. I jest done promised him dat
we were gwine home t' dinnah, an' he 'spects a manger full ob oats. Ef
I got to Mistah Swift's house wid him, I couldn't no mo' git him t'
come back widout his dinnah, dan yo' all kin git dat 'ar car t' move
widout dem fusin' t'ings yo' all talked about."

"Bless my necktie!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "That's all nonsense!  You
don't suppose that mule understands what you say to him, do you? How
does he know you promised him his dinner?"

"I doan't know how he know, Mistah Damon," replied Eradicate, "but he
do know, jest de same. I know hit would be laik pullin' teeth an' wuss
too, t' git Boomerang t' start back wid dem foosd t'ings until after
he's had his dinner. Wouldn't it, Boomerang?"

The mule waved his long ears as if in answer.

"Bless my soul, I believe he does understand!" cried Mr. Damon.

"Of course he do," put in the colored man. "I'se awful sorry.  Now if
it were afternoon I could bring back dem what-d'ye-call-'ems in a
jiffy, 'cause Boomerang allers feels good arter he has his dinnah, but
befo' dat--" and Eradicate shook his head, as if there was no more to
be said on the subject.

"Well," remarked Tom, sadly, "I guess there's no help for it.  We'll
have to walk home, unless you two want to wait until I can ride back
with Eradicate, and come back on my motor cycle. Then I'll have to
leave the cycle here, for I can't get it in the car."

"Bless my collar button!" cried Mr. Damon. "It's like the puzzle of the
fox, the goose and the bag of corn on the banks of a stream. I guess
we'd better all walk."

"Hold on!" exclaimed Mr. Sharp. "Is your mule good and strong,
Eradicate?"

"Strong? Why dish yeah mule could pull a house ober--dat is when he's
got a mind to. An' he'd do most anyt'ing now, 'ca'se he's anxious t'
git home t' his dinnah; ain't yo' all, Boomerang?"

Once more the mule waved his ears, like signal flags.

"Then I have a proposition to make," went on the balloonist.  "Unhitch
the mule from the load of wood, and hitch him to the auto. We've got
some rope along, I noticed. Then the mule can pull us and the runabout
home."

"Good idea!" cried Mr. Damon.

"Dat's de racket!" ejaculated Eradicate. "I'll jest sequesterate dish
year load ob wood side ob de road, an' hitch Boomerang to de auto."

Tom said nothing for a few seconds.  He gazed sadly at his auto, which
he hoped would win the touring club's prize. It was a bitter pill for
him to swallow.

"Towed by a mule!" he exclaimed, shaking his head, and smiling
ruefully. "The fastest car in this country towed by a mule! It's tough
luck!"

"'Tain't half so bad as goin' widout yo' dinnah, Mistah Swift!"
remarked Eradicate, as he began to harness the mule to the electric
runabout.

Boomerang made no objection to the transfer. He looked around once or
twice as he was being made fast to the auto and, when the word was
given he stepped out as if pulling home stalled cars was his regular
business. Tom sat beside Eradicate on the front seat, and steered,
while the colored man drove the mule, and Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon were
in the "tonneau" seats as Tom called them.

"I hope no one sees us," thought Tom, but he was doomed to
disappointment. When nearly home he heard an auto approaching, and in
it were Andy Foger, Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey. The three cronies
stared at the odd sight of Boomerang ambling along, with his great ears
flapping, drawing Tom's speedy new car.

"Ha! Ha!" laughed Andy. "So that's the motive power he's going to use!
Look at him, fellows. I thought his new electric, that was going to
beat my car, and win the prize, was to be two hundred horse power.
Instead it's one mule power! That's rich!" and Andy's chums joined in
the laugh at poor Tom.

The young inventor said nothing, for there was nothing he could say. In
dignified silence he passed the car containing his enemies, they,
meanwhile, jeering at him.

"Dat's all right," spoke Eradicate, sympathizing with his young
employer. "Maybe dey'll 'want a tow derselves some day, an' when dey
does, I'll make Boomerang pull 'em in a ditch."

But this was small comfort to Tom. He made up his mind, though, that he
would demonstrate that his car could do all that he had claimed for it,
and that very soon.




CHAPTER XIV

A GREAT RUN


Boomerang did not belie the reputation Eradicate had given him as a
beast of strength. Though the electric runabout was heavy, the mule
managed to move it along the road at a fair speed, with the four
occupants. Perhaps the animal knew that at the end of his journey a
good feed awaited him. At any rate they were soon within sight of the
Swift home.

Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp refrained from making any comments that might
hurt Tom's feelings, for they realized the chagrin felt by the young
inventor in having his apparatus go back on him at the first trial. But
our hero was not the kind of a lad who is disheartened by one failure,
or even half a dozen.

The humor of the situation appealed to him, and, as he turned the auto
into the driveway, and noticed Boomerang's long ears waving to and fro,
he laughed.

The lad insisted on putting new fuses in the car before he ate his
dinner, and then, satisfied that the motor was once more in running
order, he partook of a hasty meal, and began making several changes
which he had decided were desirable. He finished them in time to go for
a little run in the car all alone on a secluded road late that
afternoon.

Tom returned, with eyes shining, and cheeks flushed with elation.

"Well, how did it go? asked his father.

"Fine! Better than I expected," responded his son enthusiastically.
"When it gets to running smoothly I'll pass anything on the road."

"Don't be too sure," cautioned Mr. Swift, but Tom only smiled.

There was still much to do on the electric runabout, and Tom spent the
next few days in adjusting the light steel wind-shield, that was to
come down over the driver's seat. He also put in a powerful electric
search-light, which was run by current from the battery, and installed
a new speedometer and an instrument to tell how much current he was
using, and how much longer the battery would run without being
exhausted. This was to enable him to know when to begin recharging it.
When the current was all consumed it was necessary to store more in the
battery. This could be done by attaching wires from a dynamo, or, in an
emergency by tapping an electric light wire in the street. But as the
battery would enable the car to run many miles on one charging, Tom did
not think he would ever have to resort to the emergency charging
apparatus. He had a new system for this, one that enabled him to do the
work in much less than the usual time.

With his new car still unpainted, and rather rough and crude in
appearance, the lad started out alone one morning, his father and Mr.
Sharp having declined to accompany him, on the plea of business to
attend to, and Mr. Damon not being at the Swift house.

Tom rode about for several hours, giving his car several severe tests
in the way of going up hills, and speeding on the level. He was
proceeding along a quiet country road, in a small town about fifteen
miles from Shopton, when, as he flashed past the small railroad
station, he saw a familiar figure standing on the platform.

"Why, Ned!" called Tom, "what are you doing over here?"

"I might ask the same thing of you. Is that your new car? It doesn't
look very new."

"Yes, this is it. I haven't had a chance to paint and varnish it yet.
But you ought to see it go. What are doing here, though?"

"I came over on some bank business. A customer here had some bonds he
wanted to dispose of and I came for them. You see we're enlarging our
business since the new bank started."

"Has it hurt your bank any?"

"Not yet, but Foger and his associates are trying hard to make us lose
money. Say, did you ever see such a place as this? I've got to wait two
hours for a train back to Shopton."

"No you haven't."

"Why not? Have they changed the timetable since I came over this
morning?"

"No, but you can ride back with me.  I'm going, and I'll show you what
my new electric car can do."

"Good!" cried the young bank cashier. "You're just in time. I was
wondering how I could kill two hours, but now I'll get in your new car
and--"

"And maybe we'll kill a few chickens, or a dog or two when we get her
speeded up," put in Tom, with a laugh in which Ned joined.

The two lads, seated in the front part of the auto, were soon moving
down the hard highway. Suddenly Tom pulled a lever and the steel
wind-shield came sliding down from the top case, meeting the forward
battery compartment, and forming a sort of slanting roof over the heads
of the two occupants.

"Here! What's this?" cried Ned.

"We're going to hit it up in a few minutes," replied the young
inventor, "and I want to reduce the wind resistance."

"Oh, I thought maybe we were going through a bombardment. It's all
right, go ahead, don't mind me. I'm game."

There was a celluloid window in the steel wind-shield, and through this
the lads could observe the road ahead of them.

As they swung along it, the speed increasing, Ned saw an auto ahead of
them.

"Whose car is that?" he asked.

"Don't know," replied Tom. "We'll be up to it in about half a minute,
though."

As the electric runabout, more dilapidated looking than ever from the
layer of dust that covered it, passed the other auto, which was a
powerful car, the solitary occupant of it, a middle-aged man, looked to
one side, and, seeing the queer machine, remarked:

"You fellows are going the wrong way to the junk heap. Turn around."

"Is that so?" asked Tom, his eyes flashing at the cheap wit of the man.
"Why we came out here to show you the way!"

"Do you want to race?" asked the man eagerly, too eagerly, Ned thought.
"I'll give you a brush, if you do, and a handicap into the bargain."

"We don't need it," replied the young inventor quickly.

"I'll wager fifty dollars I can beat you bad on this three-mile
stretch," went on the autoist. "How about it?"

"I'll race you, but I don't bet," answered Tom, a bit stiffly.

"Oh, be a sport," urged the man.

Tom shook his head. He had slowed down his machine, and was running
even with the gasolene car now. He noticed that it was a new one, of
six cylinders, and looked speedy. Perhaps he was foolish to pit his
untried car against it. Yet he had confidence in his battery and motor.

"Well, we'll race for the fun of it then," went on the man. "Do you
want a handicap?"

Tom shook his head again, and there came around his mouth a grim look.

"All right," assented the other. "Only you're going to be beat badly. I
never saw an electric car yet that could do anything except to crawl
along."

"You're going to see one now," was all the retort Tom permitted himself.

"Here we go then!" cried the man, and he gave his gear handle a yank,
and shoved over the sparking and gasolene levers.

His car instantly shot ahead, and went "chug chugging" down the road in
a cloud of dust. At the same moment Tom, in answer to a look from Ned,
who feared his friend was going to be left behind, turned more power
into the motor. The humming, purring sound increased and the electric
car forged ahead.

"Can you catch him?" asked Ned.

"Watch," was all Tom said.

The hum of the motor became a sort of whine, and the electric rapidly
acquired speed. It crept up on the gasolene car, as an express train
overtakes a freight, and the man, looking back, and expecting to see
his rival far behind was surprised to note the queer looking vehicle
lapping his rear wheels.

"Well, you are coming on, aren't you?" he asked. "Maybe you'll keep up
now!" He shifted the gears, using a little more gasolene.  For a moment
his car opened a wide gap between it and Tom's, but the young inventor
had only begun to race. Still louder purred the motor, and in a few
minutes Tom was running on even terms with his competitor. The man
looked annoyed, and tried, by the skilful use of gasolene and sparking
levers, to leave Tom behind.  But the electric held her own.

"I've got to go the limit I see," remarked the man at last, glancing
sideways at the other car. "I'll tell 'em you're coming," he added,
"though I must say your electric does better than any of its kind I
ever came across."

"I'm not done yet," was the comment of our hero. But the man did not
hear him, for he was yanking into place the lever that enabled him to
run on direct drive for fourth speed.

Forward shot his car, and, for perhaps a quarter of a mile it led. The
racers were almost at the end of the three-mile level stretch of road,
and if Tom was going to win the impromptu contest it seemed high time
he began.

"Can you catch him?" asked Ned anxiously.

"Watch," was his chum's reply. "I haven't used my high speed gear yet.
I'm afraid the fuses won't stand it, but here goes for a try, anyhow."

He threw over a switch, changed a lever and then, having pushed into
place the last gear, he grasped the steering wheel more firmly.

There was need of it, for, in an instant, the electric runabout, with
the motors fairly roaring, swept up the road, after the gasolene car
that was almost hidden from sight in a cloud of dust. Faster and faster
went Tom's car. The young inventor was listening with critical ear to
the song of the machinery. He wanted to learn if it was running sweet
and true, for that is how a careful mechanic tests his apparatus. Foot
by foot the distance between the two cars lessened. Now the electric
was lapping the rear wheels of the gasolene machine, but the driver did
not know it. His whole attention was on the road ahead of him.

"Half a mile more!" cried Ned, naming the distance which yet remained
of the straight stretch. "Can you do it, Tom?"

His chum nodded. He shoved the controller handle over to the last
notch, and then waited an anxious second. Would the fuse carry the
extra load? It seemed so, for there was a slight increase of power.

An instant later Tom gave a sudden twist to the steering wheel.  It was
well that he did, for he was passing the gasolene car dangerously
close. Then he was ahead of it, and in a second he was three lengths in
advance.

Desperately the man opened his muffler, and sought to gain by this
advantage, but though his car gave off explosions like a battery of
guns in action, he could not gain on Tom. The electric shot around a
curve in the road, winner of the impromptu race by an eighth of a mile.

"Well," asked Tom of his chum, as he slowed down, for the road now was
not so good, "did I do it?"

"You certainly did. Whew! But we did scoot along?"

"Eighty miles an hour there one spell," went on the young inventor,
glancing at a gauge. "But I've got to do better than that to win the
big race."




CHAPTER XV

ANDY FOGER'S BLACK EYE


Around the bend came the six-cylinder touring car. The driver, with a
surprised look on his face, was slacking up. He ran his machine up
alongside of Tom's.

"Say," he asked, in dazed tones, "did you take a short cut, or anything
like that to get ahead of me?"

"No," answered the youth.

"And you didn't jump me in the air?"

"No," was Tom's answer, smilingly given.

"Well, all I've got to say is that you've got a wonderful car there,
Mr.--er--er--"  He paused suggestively.

"Swift is my name," our hero answered. "Thomas Swift, of Shopton."

"Ah, I've heard of you. My name is Layton--Paul Layton. I'm from
Netherton. Let's see, you built an airship, didn't you?"

"I helped," Tom admitted modestly.

"Well, you beat me fair and square, and if I do say it myself I've got
a fairly speedy car. Took two firsts at the Indianapolis meet last
month. But you certainly scooted ahead of me. Where did you buy that
electric, if I may ask?"

"I made it."

"I might have known," admitted the man. "But are you going to put them
on the market? If you are I'd like to get one. I want the fastest car
going, and you seem to have it."

"I hadn't thought of manufacturing them for sale," said the young
inventor. "If I do, I'll let you know."

"I wish you would. My! I had no idea you could beat me, but you
did--fair and square."

There was some more talk, and then Mr. Layton started on, after
exacting from Tom a further promise to let him know if any electrics
were to be made for sale.

"You certainly have a wonderful car," complimented Ned, as he and his
chum took a short cut to Shopton.

"Well, I'm not quite satisfied with it," declared Tom.

"Why not?"

"Well, I've set a hundred miles an hour as my limit. I didn't make but
eighty to-day. I've got to have more speed if I go up against the crowd
that will race for the touring club's prize."

"Can you make a hundred miles?"

"I think so. I've got to change my gears, though, and use heavier
fuses. I was afraid every second that one of the fuses would melt, and
leave me stranded. But they stood pretty well. Of course, when the car,
geared as it is now, has been run a little longer it will go faster,
but it won't come up to a hundred miles an hour. That's what I want,
and that's what I'm going to get," and the lad looked very determined.

Ned was taken to the bank, and, as Tom turned his machine around, to go
home, he saw, standing on the steps of the new bank, which was almost
across the street from the old one, Andy Foger, and the bully's father.
The red-haired lad laughed at Tom's rough looking car, and said
something to his parent, but Mr. Foger did not notice Tom. Not that
this caused our hero any uneasiness, however.

But, as he swung away from the bank, he saw, coming up the street a
figure that instantly attracted his attention. It was that of Mr. Berg,
and Tom at once recalled the night he had pursued the submarine agent,
and torn loose his watch charm. Mr. Berg was evidently going to enter
the new bank, for, at the sight of the former agent, Mr. Foger
descended the steps, and went to meet him.

Tom, however, had decided upon a plan of action. He steered his machine
in toward the curb, ran up the steel wind-shield, and called:

"Mr. Berg!"

"Eh? What's that?" asked the agent, in some surprise. Then, as he
caught sight of Tom, and recognized him, he added: "I'm very busy now,
my young friend. You'll have to excuse me."

"I won't detain you a moment," went on Tom, casually. "I have something
of yours that I wish to return to you."

"Something of mine?" Mr. Berg was evidently puzzled. He approached the
electric car, in spite of the fact that Mr. Foger was calling him.
"Something of mine? What is it?"

"This!" exclaimed Tom suddenly, extending the compass watch charm,
which he always carried with him of late.

"That! Where did you get that. I lost it--"

Mr. Berg paused in some confusion.

"I grabbed it off your watch chain the night you were hiding in our
shrubbery, and tripped me into the brook," answered the lad, looking
the man squarely in the eye.

"Hiding? Tripped you? Grabbed that off my chain--" stammered Mr. Berg.
He had taken the charm up in his fingers, but now he quickly dropped it
back into Tom's hand. "I guess you're mistaken," he added quickly.
"That's not mine. I never had one--I--er--that's not mine--at
least--Oh, you'll have to excuse me, young man, I'm in a hurry, and I
have an important engagement!" and with that Mr. Berg wheeled off, and
joined Mr. Foger, who stood on the sidewalk, waiting for him.

"I thought sure it was yours," said Tom, easily. "Perhaps Mr. Foger
will keep it in one of the safety-deposit boxes of his bank, until the
owner claims it," and he looked at the banker.

"What's that?" asked Andy's father.

"This watch charm which I grabbed off Mr. Berg's chain the night he was
sneaking around our house, and crossed the electric wires," went on the
lad.

"Don't listen to him. He doesn't know what he is saying!" exclaimed the
former submarine boat agent. "It's not my charm.  He's crazy!"

"Oh, am I?" thought Tom, with a grim look on his face. "Well, we'll see
about that, Mr. Berg," and, putting the charm back in his pocket, Tom
swung his machine toward home, while the agent and the banker entered
the new institution.

"So they're getting chummy," mused Tom. "Andy and Berg were friends
when Andy shut me up in the submarine tank, and now Berg comes here to
do business, and Foger and his associates are trying to put the old
bank out of business. I wonder if there's any connection there? I must
keep my eyes open. Berg is an unscrupulous man, and so is Andy's
father, to say nothing of the red-haired bully himself. He had nerve to
deny that was his charm. Well, maybe I'll catch him some day."

Tom spent a busy week making new adjustments to his electric car,
changing the gear and providing for heavier fuses. He was planning for
another trip on the road, as the time for the great race was drawing
near, and he wanted the mechanism to be in perfect shape.

One evening, as he was preparing for a short night trip to Mansburg,
where he had promised to call for Miss Nestor, Tom left his machine
standing in the road in front of the house, while he went back to get a
robe, as it threatened to be chilly.

As he came back to enter the car, he saw some one standing near it.

"Is that you, Ned?" he called. "Come, take a spin."

Hardly had he spoken than there sounded from the machine a whirr that
told of the current being turned on.

"Don't do that!" cried Tom, knowing at once that it could not be Ned,
who never meddled with the machinery.

A blinding flash and a loud report followed, and Tom saw some one leap
from his car, and try to run away. But the figure stumbled, and, a
moment later the young inventor was upon him, grappling with him.

"Here! Let me go!" cried a voice, and Tom uttered an exclamation of
surprise.

"Andy Foger!" he cried. "I've caught you! You tried to damage my car!"

"Yes, and I'm hurt, too!" whined Andy. "My father will sue you for
damages if I die."

"No danger of that; you're too mean," murmured Tom, as he maintained a
tight grip on the bully.

"You let me go!" demanded Andy, squirming to get away.

"Wait until I see what damage you've done," retorted the young
inventor. "The worst, though, would be the blowing out of a fuse, for I
had the gear disconnected. You wait a minute now. Maybe it's you who'll
have to pay damages."

"You let me go!" fairly screamed Andy, and he aimed a blow at Tom. It
caught our hero on the chest and Tom's fighting blood was up in an
instant. He drew back his left hand, and delivered a blow that landed
fairly on Andy's right eye. The bully staggered and went down in the
dust.

"There!" cried Tom, righteously angry. "That will teach you not to try
to damage my car, and then hit me into the bargain! Now clear out,
before I give you some more!"

Whining and blubbering Andy arose to his feet.

"You just wait. I'll get square with you for this," he threatened.

"You can accept part of that as pay for what you did in the tar and
feathering game," added Tom. Then, as Andy moved in front of one of the
electric side lamps on the car, Tom uttered a whistle of surprise. For
both of Andy's eyes were bruised and swollen, though Tom had only hit
him once.

"Look at me!" cried the bully, more squint-eyed than ever.  "Look at
me! You hit me in one eye, and that explosion hit me in the other! My
father will sue you for this."

As he hurried off down the road Tom understood. Andy coming along, had
seen Tom's car standing there, and, thinking to do some mischief, had
climbed in, and turned on the power. Perhaps he hoped it would run into
the roadside ditch and be smashed. But as the gear was out, turning on
the electric current had a different effect. As the bully pulled the
handle over too quickly, throwing almost the entire force of the
battery into the wires at once, the load was too heavy for them. A
safety fuse blew out, causing the flare and the explosion, and a piece
of the soft lead-like metal had hit the red-haired lad in the eye.
Tom's fist had completed the work on the other optic, and for several
days thereafter Andy Foger remained in seclusion. When he did go out
there were many embarrassing questions put to him, as to when he had
had the fight. Andy didn't care to answer. As for Tom, it did not take
long to put a new fuse in his car, and he greatly enjoyed his ride with
Miss Nestor that night.




CHAPTER XVI

TROUBLE AT THE BANK


Coming in rather late from his trip to Mansburg, and thinking of some
things he and Miss Nestor had talked about, Tom was rather surprised,
on reaching the house, to see a light in his father's particular room,
where the aged inventor did his reading and his planning of new devices.

"Dad's up rather late," said Tom to himself. "I wonder if he's studying
over some new machine."

The lad ran his auto into the temporary garage he had built for it, and
connected the wires of a burglar alarm he had arranged, to give warning
in case any of his enemies should seek to damage the car.

Tom encountered Garret Jackson, the aged inventor who was going his
rounds, seeing that everything was all right about the various shops.

"Anybody with my father, Garret?" asked the lad. "I see he's still up."

"Yes," was the rather unexpected reply. "Mr. Damon is with him.
They've been in your father's room all the evening--ever since you went
away in the car."

"Anything the matter?" inquired the young inventor, a bit anxious, as
he thought of the Happy Harry gang.

"Well, I don't know," and the engineer seemed puzzled. "They called me
in once to know if everything was all right outside, and to inquire if
you were back. I saw, then, that they were busy figuring over
something, but I didn't take much notice. Only I heard Mr. Damon say:
'There's going to be trouble if we can't realize on those bonds,' and
then I came away."

"Is that all he said?" asked Tom.

"No, he said 'Bless my buttons,' or something like that; but he blesses
so many things I didn't pay much attention."

"That's right," agreed the lad. "But I wonder what the trouble is
about? I must go see."

As he passed along the hall, out of which his father's combined study
and library opened, the aged inventor came to the door.

"Is that you, Tom?" he asked.

"Yes, Dad."

"Come in here, if you haven't anything else to do. Mr. Damon is here."

Tom needed but a single glance at the faces of his father and Mr. Damon
to see that something was troubling the two. The table in front of them
was littered with papers covered with rows of figures.

"What's the matter?" asked Tom.

"Well, I suppose I ought not to let it bother me, but it does," replied
his father.

"Something wrong with your patents, Dad? Has the crowd of bad men been
bothering you again?"

"No, it isn't that. It's trouble at the bank, Tom."

"Has it been robbed again?" asked the lad quickly. "If it has I can
prove an alibi," and he smiled at the recollection of the time he and
Mr. Damon had been accused of looting the vault, as told in "Tom Swift
and His Airship."

"No, it hasn't been robbed in just that way," put in Mr. Damon.  "But,
bless my shoe laces, it's almost as bad! You see, Tom, since Mr. Foger
started the new bank he's done his best to cripple the one in which
your father and I are interested. I may say we are very vitally
interested in it, for, since the withdrawal of Foger and his
associates, your father and I have been elected directors."

"I didn't know that," remarked the lad.

"No, I didn't tell you, because you were so busy on your electric car,"
rejoined Mr. Swift. "But Mr. Damon and I, being both large depositors,
were asked to assume office, and, as I was not very busy on patent
affairs, I consented."

"But what is the trouble?" inquired Tom.

"I'm coming to it," resumed Mr. Damon. "Bless my check book, I'm coming
to it! You see we have lost several good customers, by reason of Foger
opening the new bank. That wouldn't have mattered so much, as between
your father and myself, and one or two others, we have enough capital
to carry on the business of the bank. But there is a more serious
matter. We hold a number of very good securities, but they are of a
class hard to realize cash for, on short notice. In other words they
are not active bonds, though they are issued by reliable concerns.
Then, too, the bank has lost considerable money by not doing as much
business as it formerly did. In short we don't know just what to do,
Tom, and your father and I were discussing it, when you came in."

"Do you need more money?" asked Tom. "I have some, that is my share
from the submarine treasure, and some I have allowed to accumulate as
royalties from my patents. It's about ten thousand dollars, and you're
welcome to it."

"Thank you, Tom," spoke his father. "We may use your cash, but we'll
need a great deal more than that."

"But why?" asked the lad. "I don't understand. If you have good bonds,
can't you dispose of them, and get the money?"

"We could, Tom, yes, if we had time," replied Mr. Damon. "But to throw
the bonds on the market at short notice would mean that we would not
get a good price for them. We would lose considerable."

"But why do it in a hurry?"

"Because there is need of hurry," responded Mr. Swift.

"That's it," joined in Mr. Damon. "We have to have cash in a hurry,
Tom, to meet pressing demands, and we don't just see our way clear to
get it. I am trying to raise it on some private securities I own, but I
can't get an answer within several days.  Meanwhile the bank may fail,
because of lack of funds. Of course no one would lose anything,
ultimately, as we could go into the hands of a receiver, and,
eventually pay dollar for dollar. Your father and I, and some of the
other directors, might lose a little, but the depositors would not. But
your father and I don't like the idea of failing. It's something I've
never done, and I'm too old to start in now, bless my cash ledger if
I'm not!"

"And for the sake of my reputation in this community I don't want to
see the bank close its doors," added Mr. Swift. "It would give Foger
too good a chance to crow over us."

"And you need cash in a hurry," went on Tom. "How much?"

"Fifty thousand dollars at least," replied Mr. Damon.

"And if you don't get it?"

The eccentric man shrugged his shoulders.

"Well," remarked Mr. Swift musingly, "I don't see that we need worry
you about it, Tom. Perhaps--"

Mr. Swift was interrupted by a ring at the front door. The three looked
at each other. It was late for a caller, and Mrs. Baggert had gone to
bed.

"I'll answer it," volunteered Tom. He switched on the electric light in
the hall, and opened the door. He was confronted by Mr. Pendergast, the
president of the bank.

"Is your father in?" asked Mr. Pendergast, and he seemed to be much
agitated.

"Yes, he is," replied the lad. "Come this way, please."

"I want to see him on important business," went on the president, as he
followed the young inventor. "I'm afraid I have bad news for him and
Mr. Damon. Bad news, Tom, bad news," and the aged banker's voice
trembled. Tom, with a chill of apprehension seeming to clutch his
heart, threw open the library door.




CHAPTER XVII

A RUN ON THE BANK


"Why, Mr. Pendergast!" exclaimed Mr. Damon, rising quickly as Tom
ushered in the aged president. "Whatever is the matter? You here at
this hour? Bless my trial balance! Is anything wrong?

"I'm afraid there is," answered the bank head. "I have just received
word which made it necessary for me to see you both at once. I'm glad
you're here, Mr. Damon."

He sank wearily into a chair which Tom placed for him, and Mr. Swift
asked:

"Have you been able to raise any cash, Mr. Pendergast?"

"No, I am sorry to say I have not, but I did not come here to tell you
that. I have bad news for you. As soon as we open our doors in the
morning, there will be a run on the bank."

"A run on the bank?" repeated Mr. Swift.

"The moment we begin business in the morning," went on Mr. Pendergast.

"Bless my soul, then don't begin business!" cried Mr. Damon.

"We must," insisted Mr. Pendergast. "To keep the doors closed would be
a confession at once that we have failed. No, it is better to open
them, and stand the run as long as we can. When we have exhausted our
cash--" he paused.

"Well?" asked Mr. Damon.

"Then we'll fail--that's all."

"But we mustn't let the bank fail!" cried Mr. Swift. "I am willing to
put some of my personal fortune into the bank capital in order to save
it. So is my son here."

"That's right," chimed in Tom heartily. "All I've got. I'm not going to
let Andy Foger get ahead of us; nor his father either."

"I'll help to the limit of my ability," added Mr. Damon.

"I appreciate all that," continued the president. "But the unfortunate
part of it is that we need cash. You gentlemen, like myself, probably,
have your money tied up in stocks and bonds. It is hard to get cash
quickly, and we must have cash as soon as we open in the morning, to
pay the depositors who will come flocking to the doors. We must prepare
for a run on the bank."

"How do you know there will be a run?" asked the young inventor.

"I received word this evening, just before I came here," replied Mr.
Pendergast. "A poor widow, who has a small amount in the bank, called
on me and said she had been advised to withdraw all her cash. She said
she preferred to see me about it first, as she did not like to lose her
interest. She said a number of her acquaintances, some of whom are
quite heavy depositors, had also been warned that the bank was unsound,
and that they ought to take out their savings and deposits at once."

"Did she say who had thus warned her?" inquired Mr. Swift.

"She did," was the reply, "and that shows me that there is a conspiracy
on foot to ruin our bank. She stated that Mr. Foger had told her our
institution was unsound."

"Mr. Foger!" cried Mr. Damon. "So this is one of his tricks to bolster
up his new bank! He hopes the people who withdraw their money from our
bank will deposit with him. I see his game. He's a scoundrel, and if
it's possible I'm going to sue him for damages after this thing is
over."

"Did he warn the others?" inquired the aged inventor.

"Not all of them," answered the president. "Some received letters from
a man signing himself Addison Berg, warning them that our bank, was
likely to fail any day."

"Addison Berg!" exclaimed Tom. "That must have been the important
business he had with Mr. Foger, the day I showed him the watch charm!
They were plotting the ruin of our bank then," and he told his father
about his disastrous pursuit of the submarine agent.

"Very likely Foger is working with Berg," admitted Mr. Damon.  "We will
attend to them later. The question is, what can we do to save the bank?"

"Get cash, and plenty of it," advised Mr. Pendergast. "Suppose we go
over the whole situation again?" and they fell to talking stocks:
bonds, securities, mortgages and interest, until the youth, interested
as he was in the situation, could follow it no longer.

"Better go to bed, Tom," advised his father. "You can't help us any,
and we have many details to go over."

The lad reluctantly consented, and he was soon dreaming that he was in
his electric auto, trying to pull up a thousand pound lump of gold from
the bottom of the sea. He awoke to find the bedclothes in a lump on his
chest, and, removing them, fell into a deep slumber.

When the young inventor awoke the next morning, Mrs. Baggert told him
that his father and Mr. Damon had risen nearly an hour before, had
partaken of a hearty breakfast, and departed.

"They told me to tell you they were at the bank," said the housekeeper.

"Did Mr. Pendergast stay all night?" inquired Tom.

"I heard some one go away about two o'clock this morning," replied the
housekeeper. "I don't know who it was."

"They must have had a long session," thought Tom, as he began on his
bacon, eggs and coffee. "I'll take a run down to the bank in my
electric in a little while."

The car was still in rather crude shape, outwardly, but the mechanism
was now almost perfect. Tom charged the batteries well before starting
out.

The youth had no sooner come in sight of the old Shopton bank, to
distinguish it from the Second National, which Mr. Foger had started,
than he was aware that something unusual had occurred.  There was quite
a crowd about it, and more persons were constantly arriving to swell
the throng.

"What's the matter?" asked Tom, of one of the few police officers of
which Shopton boasted, though the lad did not need to be told.

"Run on the bank," was the brief answer. "It's failed."

Tom felt a pang of disappointment. Somehow, he had hoped that his
father and his friends might have been able to stave off ruin. As he
approached nearer Tom was made aware that the crowd was in an ugly mood.

"Why don't they open the doors and give us our money?" cried one
excited woman. "It's ours! I worked hard for mine, an' now they want to
keep it from us. I wish I'd put it in the new bank."

"Yes, that's the best place," added another. "That Mr. Foger has lots
of money."

"I can see the hand of Andy's father, and that of Mr. Berg, at work
here," thought Tom, "They have spread rumors of the bank's trouble, and
hope to profit by it. I wish I could find a way to beat them at their
own game."

As the minutes passed, and the bank was not opened, the ugly temper of
the crowd increased. The few police could do nothing with the mob, and
several, bolder than the rest, advocated battering down the doors. Some
went up the steps and began to pound on the portals. Tom looked for a
sight of his father or Mr. Damon, but could not see either.

It was not the regular hour for opening the bank, but when the police
reminded the people of this they only laughed.

"I guess they ain't going to open anyhow!" shouted a man.  "They've got
our money, and they're going to keep it. What difference is an hour,
anyway?"

"Yes, if they have the money, why don't they open, and not wait until
ten o'clock?" cried another. "I've got a hundred and five dollars in
there, and I want it!"

More excited persons were arriving every minute. The crowd surged this
way, and that. Many looked anxiously at the clock in the tower of the
town hall. The gilded hands pointed to a few minutes of ten. Would the
bank open its doors when the hour boomed out? Many were anxiously
asking this question.

Tom sat in his electric car, near the front of the bank. The interest
of the crowd, which under ordinary circumstances would have been
centered in the queer vehicle, was not drawn toward it.  The people
were all thinking of their money.

Suddenly one of the two doors of the bank slowly opened. There was a
yell from the crowd, and a rush to get in. But the police managed to
hold the leaders back, and then Tom saw that it was Ned Newton, who
stood in the partly-opened portal. He held up his hand to indicate
silence, and a hush fell over the mob.

"The bank is open for business," Ned announced, "but there must be no
rush. The building is not large enough to accommodate you all. If you
form a line, you will be admitted in turn. The bank hopes to pay you
all."

"Hopes!" cried a woman scornfully. "We can't eat hopes, young man, nor
yet pay the rent with it. Hopes indeed!"

But Ned had said all he cared to, and, with rather a white face, he
went back inside. The one door remained open and, with a policeman on
either side, a line of anxious depositors was slowly formed. Tom
watched them crowding and surging forward, all eager to be first to get
their cash out, lest there be not enough for all. As he watched, the
young inventor was aware that some was signaling to him from the big
window of the bank. He looked more closely and saw Ned Newton beckoning
to him, and the young cashier was motioning Tom to go around to the
rear, where a door of the bank opened on a small alley. Wondering what
was wanted, Tom slowly ran his machine down the side street, and up the
alley. No one paid any attention to him.

A porter admitted the lad, and he made his way to the private offices,
where he knew his father and Mr. Damon would be. In the corridors he
could hear the murmur of the throng and the chink of money, as the
tellers paid it out.

"Well, Tom, this is bad business," remarked Mr. Swift, as he saw his
son. The lad noticed that Mr. Damon was in the telephone booth.

"Yes, Dad," admitted Tom. "It's a run, all right. What are you going to
do?"

"The best we can. Pay out all the cash we have, and hope that before
that time, the people will come to their senses. The bank is all right
if they would only wait. But I'm afraid they won't and, after we pay
out all the cash we have, we'll have to close the doors. Then there's
sure to be an unpleasant scene, and maybe some of the more hot-headed
ones will advocate violence. We have given orders to the tellers to pay
out as slowly as possible, so as to enable us to gain some time."

"And all you need is money; is that it, Dad?"

"That's it, Tom, but we have exhausted every possibility. Mr. Damon is
trying a forlorn hope now, but, even if he is successful--"

Before Mr. Swift had ceased speaking, Mr. Damon fairly burst from the
telephone booth. He was much excited.

"I've got it! I've got it!" he cried.

"What?" asked Mr. Swift and Tom in the same breath.

"The cash, or, what's just as good, the promise of it. I called up Mr.
Chase, of the Clayton National Bank, and he has agreed to take the
railroad securities I offered him as collateral, and let me have sixty
thousand dollars on them! That will give us cash enough to weather the
storm. Hurrah! We're all right now. Bless my check book!"

"The Clayton National Bank," remarked Mr. Swift, and his voice was
hopeless. "It's forty miles away, Mr. Damon, and no railroad around
here runs anywhere near it. No one could get there and back with the
cash to-day, in time to save us from ruin. It's impossible! Our last
chance is gone."

"How far did you say it was, Dad?" asked Tom quickly.

"Forty miles there, over forty, I guess, and not very good roads. We
would need to have the cash here before three o'clock to be of any
service to us. No, it's out of the question. The bank will have to
fail!"

"No!" cried the young inventor, and his voice rang out through the
room. "I'll get the cash for you!"

"How?" gasped Mr. Damon. "You can't get there and back in time?"

"Yes, I can!" cried Tom. "In my electric runabout! I can make it go a
hundred miles an hour, if necessary! Probably I'll have to run slow
over the bad roads; but I can do it! I know I can.  I'll get the sixty
thousand dollars for you!"

For a moment there was silence. Then Mr. Damon cried:

"Good! And I'll go with you and deliver the securities to Mr. Chase.
Come on, Tom Swift! Bless my collar button, but maybe we can yet save
the old bank after all!"




CHAPTER XVIII

AFTER THE CASH


Tom's proposal as a way out of the difficulty, and the prompt seconding
of it by Mr. Damon, seemed to deprive the other bank officials, Mr.
Swift included, of the power of speech for a few moments. Then, as
there came to the room where the scene had taken place, the sound of
the mob outside, clamoring for cash, Mr. Pendergast, the president,
remarked in a low voice:

"It seems to be the only way. Do you think you can do it, Tom Swift?"

"I'm sure of it, as far as my electric car is concerned," replied the
young inventor. "If we get the cash I'll have it back here on time. The
runabout is all ready for a fast trip."

"Then don't lose any time, Tom," advised his father. "Every minute
counts."

"Yes," added Mr. Damon. "Come on. I've got the securities in my valise,
and we can bring the cash back in the same satchel. Come on, Tom."

The eccentric character caught up his valise, and started from the
room. Tom followed.

"Now, my son, be careful," advised his father. "You know the need of
haste, but don't take unnecessary risks. You'd better go out the back
way, as the crowd is easily excited."

Little more was said. Mr. Swift clasped his son's hand in a firm
pressure, and the bank president nervously bade the lad good-by. Then,
slipping out of the bank, by the rear entrance, the porter closing the
door after them, Tom and Mr. Damon took their places in the electric
machine.

"Just imagine you're racing for that three-thousand-dollar prize,
offered by the Touring Club of America, Tom," observed Mr. Damon, as he
deposited the valise at his feet.

"I don't have to do that," replied the youth. "I'm trying for a bigger
prize than that. I want to save the bank, and defeat the schemes of the
Fogers--father and son."

Tom turned on the power, and the machine rolled out on the main street.
As it turned the corner, leaving the impatient crowd of depositors, now
larger than ever, behind, Mr. Damon glanced over at the new bank, and,
as he did so, he called to Tom:

"There are the Fogers now."

The young inventor looked, and saw Andy and his father on the steps of
the new institution.

At the sight of the electric car, speeding along, Andy turned and spoke
to his parent. What he said seemed to impress Mr. Foger, for he
started, and looked more intently at Tom and Mr. Damon. Then, as Tom
watched, he saw the two excitedly conversing, and a moment later Andy
ran off in the direction in which Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey lived.

"I wonder if he's up to any tricks?" thought Tom, as he turned on more
power. "Well, if he is, I'll soon be where he can't reach me."

The young inventor did not dare send his car at full speed through the
streets of the town, and it was not until several minutes had passed
that they could go at more than the ordinary rate. But once the open
country was reached Tom "opened her up full," and the song the motor
sung was one of power. The vehicle quickly gathered headway and was
soon fairly whizzing along.

"If we keep this up we'll be there and back in good time," remarked Mr.
Damon.

"Yes, but we can't do it," replied his companion. "The road to Clayton
is a poor one, and we'll soon be on it. Then we'll have to go slow. But
I'll make all the time I can until then."

So, for several miles more they crept along, at times having to reduce
to almost a walking pace, because of bad roads. Mr. Damon looked at his
watch almost every other minute.

"Eleven o'clock," he remarked, as they passed a milestone, "and we're
not half way there. Bless my gizzard, but I'm afraid we won't make it,
Tom. We left about ten, and we ought to be back by two o'clock to do
any good. That's four hours, and it will take some time to transfer the
securities, and get the cash. Every minute counts."

"I know it," answered Tom, "and I'm going to count every minute."

With eager eyes he watched every inch of the road, to steer to the best
advantage. His hands gripped the wheel until his knuckles showed white
with the strain, and, every now and then his right hand adjusted the
speed lever or the controller handle, while his foot was on the
emergency brake, ready to stop the car at the first sign of danger.

And there was danger, not infrequently, for the road was up and down
hill, over frail bridges, and along steep cliffs. It was no pleasure
tour they were on.

When a little over half the distance had been made they came to a
better road, and Tom was able to use full speed ahead. Then the
electric went so fast that, had it not been for the steel wind-shield
in front, Mr. Damon, at any rate, would have been short of breath.

"This is going some!" he cried to Tom. The lad nodded grimly, and
shoved the controller handle over to the last notch. Then came a bad
stretch and they had to slow down again. As they were about out of it
there came a little flash of fire and the motor stopped.

"Bless my overshoes!" cried Mr. Damon. "What's that; a fuse blown out?"

"No," replied Tom, with a puzzled air. "But something has gone wrong."
Hastily he got out, and made an examination. He found it was only one
of the unimportant wires which had short-circuited, and it was soon
adjusted. But they had lost five precious minutes. Tom tried to make up
for lost time, but came to a hill a little later, and this reduced
their speed.

"Do you think we can make it before twelve?" asked Mr. Damon anxiously.
"We've got to, if we're to get back before three, Tom."

"I'll try," was the calm answer, and Tom's jaw was shut still more
tightly. Once again came more favorable roads and pushing the car to
the limit the occupants were rejoiced, a little later, as they topped a
hill, to come in sight of a fairly large city.

"There's Clayton!" cried Mr. Damon.

Ten minutes later they were rolling through the main street, and as
they stopped in front of the bank, the noon whistles blew shrill and
noisily.

"You did it, Tom!" cried Mr. Damon, springing out with the valise of
securities. "Now be ready for the return trip. I'll be with you as soon
as possible."

He went up the bank steps three at a time, like some boy instead of an
elderly man. Tom looked after him for a second and then got down to oil
up his car, and make some adjustments that had rattled loose from the
rough road. Unmindful of the curious throng that gathered he crawled
under the machine with his oil-can.

He had finished his work, and was back in his seat, ready to start, but
Mr. Damon had not reappeared.

"It's taking him a good while to get that cash," thought Tom.  "Maybe
the securities were no good."

But, a few minutes later, Mr. Damon came hurrying from the bank. The
valise he carried seemed much heavier than when he went in.

"It's all right, Tom," he said. "I've got it. Now for the trip home,
and I hope we don't have any accidents. It took longer than I thought
to check over the bonds and receipt for them. But I've got the cash.
Now to save the bank!"

He took his place beside the young inventor, holding the valise between
his knees, while Tom turned on the power and sent his car dashing down
the street, and toward the road that led to Shopton.




CHAPTER XIX

STOPPED ON THE ROAD


"Did Mr. Chase make any objection to giving you the cash?" asked Tom,
as he shoved the controller over another notch, and caused the motor to
make a higher note in its song of speed.

"Oh, no, he was very nice about it," replied Mr. Damon. "He said he
hoped our bank would pull through. Said if we needed more cash we could
have it."

It was nearly one o'clock, and they had the worst part of the journey
yet to go. Thirty miles of stiff roads lay between them and Shopton,
the last five and the first five being fairly good, with, here and
there, soft spots.

Up hill and down went the electric auto. At every opportunity Tom let
out all the speed he could draw from the motor, but there were many
times when he had to slow down. He had just made the ascent of a steep
hill, and was turning into a fairly good road, skirting the edge of a
steep cliff, when there came a sharp report.

"Bless my soul! That's a fuse, I'm sure of it!" cried Mr. Damon.

"No," announced Tom, as he quickly shut off the power. "It's a
puncture. One of the inner tubes of the tire has been pierced. I was
afraid of that tube."

"What have you got to do; put on a new tire?" asked Mr. Damon.

"No, I'm going to put on a new wheel. I carry two spare ones with tires
all ready inflated. It won't take long."

But the process of changing wheels consumed more time than Tom
anticipated for the nut was stuck, and he and Mr. Damon had to exert
all their strength before they could loosen it. When the new wheel was
in place ten minutes had been lost.

"Hold on now, I'm going to speed her!" cried Tom, when they were once
more in their seats, and speed the machine he did. The road was rough,
but despite this the lad turned on almost full power. Over the bumps
they went, around curves and into rain-washed ruts careening from side
to side, and throwing Mr. Damon about, as he expressed it afterward,
"like a bean inside of a football." As for the young inventor his grasp
of the steering wheel, and the manner in which he could brace himself
against the foot pedals, held him more firmly in place. On and on they
rushed, covering mile after mile, and approaching Shopton where so much
depended on their arrival.

Good and bad stretches of the road alternated, but now that Tom had
seen of what mettle his car was made, he did not spare it as much as he
had on the first trip. He saw that his machine would stand hard knocks,
and the way the battery and motor was behaving was a joy to him. He
knew that if he could make that eighty-mile run in safety he stood a
good chance of winning the prize, for no harder test could have been
devised.

But the race was still far from won. There was a particularly unsafe
stretch of road yet to be covered, and then would come a smooth highway
into Shopton.

"Ten miles more," observed Mr. Damon, snapping shut his big gold watch.
"Ten miles more, and it's a quarter of two now. We ought to be there at
a quarter after, and that will be in good time, eh, Tom?"

"I think so, but I don't know about this piece of road we're coming to.
It seems worse than when we passed over it this morning."

As he spoke the auto began to slow up, for the wheels had struck some
heavy sand, and it was necessary to reduce the current. Tom turned back
the controller handle, but watched with eager eyes for a sign that the
roadbed was harder, so that he could increase speed.

As the car turned around a curve, passing through a lonely stretch of
country, with woods on either side of the highway, Tom glancing up,
uttered a cry of astonishment.

"What's the matter; something gone wrong?" asked his companion.

For answer Tom pointed. There, just ahead of them, was a big load of
hay, and it was evident that the driver, was in no particular hurry.

"We can't pass that without getting in over our hubs!" cried Tom. "If
we turn out the side ditches are so soft that we'll need help to pull
out, and the road is so narrow for several miles that we'll have to
trail along behind that fellow."

"Bless my check book!" cried Mr. Damon. "Are we going to lose, after
all, on account of a load of hay? No, I'll buy it from him first, at
double the market price, tip it over, set fire to it, toss it in the
ditch, and then we can go past!"

"Maybe that will answer," retorted Tom, smiling grimly.

He put on a little more speed, and was soon close up behind the load of
hay, ringing his electric bell as a warning.

"I say!" called Mr. Damon to the unseen driver, "can't you turn out and
let us pass?"

"Ha! Hum! Wa'al I guess not!" came the answer, in unmistakable farmer's
accents. "You automobile fellers is too gol-hanged smart, racin' along
th' roads. I've got just as good a right here as you fellers have, by
heck!" The driver did not show himself.

"We know that," responded Tom, as quickly as he could, for he did not
want to anger the man. "But our machine is so heavy that if we turn
into the ditch I'm afraid we'll be mired."

"Huh! So'll I," was the retort from the unseen driver.. "Think I want
t' spile my load of hay?"

"But you have wide tires on, and you wouldn't sink in far," answered
the young inventor. "Besides, it's very necessary that we get past. A
great deal depends on our speed."

"So it does on mine," was the reply. "Ef I git t' market late I'll have
t' stay all night, an' spend money on a hotel bill."

"I'll pay it! I'll pay your bill if you'll only pull out!" cried Mr.
Damon. "I'll give you a hundred dollars!"

He suddenly ceased speaking. From the bushes along the road sprang
several ragged, masked figures. Each one, aiming his weapon at Tom,
said in a low voice, that could not have been heard by the driver of
the hay wagon:

"Slow up your machine, young feller! We want to speak with you, and
don't you make a loud noise, or it won't be healthy for you!"

"Why of all the--!" began Mr. Damon, but another of the footpads
leveling his weapon at the eccentric man growled:

"Dry up, if you don't want to get shot!"

Mr. Damon subsided. Discretion was very plainly the better part of
valor. Tom had shut off the current. The load of hay continued on
ahead. Tom thought perhaps the driver of it might have been in
collusion with the thieves, to cause the auto to slow up.

"What do you want with us?" asked the young inventor, trying to speak
calmly, but finding it a hard task, with a revolver pointed at him.

"You know what we want," exclaimed the leader, in a low voice.  "We
want that cash you got from the bank, and we're going to have it! Come,
now, shell out!" and he advanced toward the automobile.




CHAPTER XX

ON TIME


Close around the electric auto crowded the members of the hold-up gang.
Their eyes seemed to glare through the holes in their black masks.
Instantly Tom thought of the other occasion when he was halted by
masked figures. Could these, by any possibility, be the same
individuals? Was this a trick of Andy Foger and his cronies?

Tom tried to pierce through the disguises. Clearly the persons were
men--not boys--and they wore the ragged clothes of tramps.  Also, there
was an air of dogged determination about them.

"Well, are you going to shell out?" asked the leader, taking a step
nearer, "or will we have to take it?"

"Bless my very existence! You don't mean to say that you're going to
take the money--I mean how do you know we have any money?" and Mr.
Damon hastily corrected himself. "What right have you to stop us in
this way? Don't you know that every minute counts? We are in a hurry."

"I know it," spoke the leading masked figure with a laugh. "I know you
have considerable money in that shebang, and I know what you hope to do
with it, prevent the run on the Shopton National Bank. But we need that
money as much as some other people and, what's more, we're going to
have it! Come on, shell out!"

"Oh, why didn't we bring a gun!" lamented Mr. Damon in a low voice to
Tom. "Isn't there anything we can do? Can't you give them an electric
shock, Tom?"

"I'm afraid not. If it wasn't for that hay wagon we could turn on the
current and make a run for it. But we'd only go into the ditch if we
tried to pass now."

The load of hay was down the road, but as Tom looked he noticed a
curious thing. It seemed to be nearer than it was when the attack of
the masked men came. The wagon actually seemed to have backed up. Once
more the thought came to the lad that possibly the load of fodder might
be one of the factors on which the thieves counted. They might have
used it to make the auto halt, and the man, or men, on it were probably
in collusion with the footpads. There was no doubt about it, the load
of hay was coming nearer, backing up instead of moving away. Tom
couldn't understand it. He gave a swift glance at the robbers. They had
not appeared to notice this, or, if they had, they gave no sign.

"Then we can't do anything," murmured Mr. Damon.

"I don't see that we can," replied the young inventor in a low voice.

"And the money we worked so hard to get won't do the bank any good,"
and Mr. Damon sighed.

"It's tough luck," agreed Tom.

"Come now, fork over that cash!" called the leader, advancing still
closer. "None of that talk between you there. If you think you can work
some trick on us you're mistaken. We're desperate men, and we're well
armed. The first show of resistance you make, and we shoot--get that,
fellows?" he added to his followers, and they nodded grimly.

"Well," remarked Mr. Damon with an air of submission, "I only want to
warn you that you are acting illegally, and that you are perpetrating a
desperate crime."

"Oh, we know that all right," answered one of the men, and Tom gave a
start. He was sure he had heard that voice before. He tried to remember
it--tried to penetrate the disguise--but he could not.

"I'll give you ten seconds more to hand over that bag of money," went
on the leader. "If you don't, we'll take it and some of you may get
hurt in the process."

There seemed nothing else to do. With a white face, but with anger
showing in his eyes Mr. Damon reached down to get the valise. Tom had
retained his grip of the steering wheel, and the starting lever. He
hoped, at the last minute, he might see a chance to dash away, and
escape, but that load of hay was in the path. He noted that it was now
quite near, but the thieves paid no attention to it.

Tom might have reversed the power, and sent his machine backward, but
he could not see to steer it if he went in that direction, and he would
soon have gone into the ditch. There was nothing to do save to hand
over the cash, it seemed.

Mr. Damon had the bag raised from the car, and the leader of the
thieves was reaching up for it, when there came a sudden interruption.

From the load of hay there sounded a fusillade of pistol shots,
cracking out with viciousness. This was instantly followed by the
appearance of three men who came running from around the load of hay,
down the road toward the thieves. Each man carried a pitchfork, and as
they ran, one of the trio shouted:

"Right at 'em, boys! Jab your hay forks clean through the scoundrels!
By Heck, I guess we'll show 'em we know how t' tackle a hold-up gang as
well as the next fellow! Right at 'em now!  Charge 'em! Stick your
forks right through 'em!"  Again there sounded a fusillade of pistol
shots.

The thieves turned as one man, and glanced at the relief so
unexpectedly approaching. They gave one look at the three determined
looking farmers, with their sharp, glittering pitchforks, and then,
without a word, they turned and fled, leaping into the bushes that
lined the roadway. The underbrush closed after them and they were
hidden from sight.

On came the three farmers, waving their effective weapons, the pistol
shots still ringing out from the load of hay. Tom could not understand
it, and could see no one firing--could detect no smoke.

"Are they gone? Did they rob ye?" asked the foremost of the trio, a
burly, grizzled farmer. "Bust my buttons, but I guess we skeered 'em
all right!"

"Bless my shoe buttons, but you certainly have!" cried Mr. Damon,
descending from the automobile, and wringing the hand of the farmer,
while Tom, thrust the bag of money under his legs and waited further
developments. The pistol shots rang out until one of the men called:

"That'll do, Bub! We've skeered 'em like Mrs. Zenoby's pet cat!  You
needn't crack that whip any more."

"Whip!" cried Tom. "Was that a whip?"

"That's what it was," explained the leading farmer. "Bub Armstrong, my
nephew, can crack it to beat th' band," and as if in proof of this
there emerged from behind the load of hay a small lad, carrying a large
whip, to which he gave a few trial cracks, like pistol shots, as if to
show his ability.

"It's all right, Bub," his uncle assured him. "We made 'em run."

"But I don't exactly understand," spoke Mr. Damon. "I thought you were
in league with those thieves, stopping us as you did with your big
load."

"So did I," admitted Tom.

"Ha! Ha!" laughed the farmer. "That's a pretty good joke.  Excuse me
for laughin'. My name's Lyon, Jethro Lyon, of Salina Township, an'
these is my two sons, Ade and Burt. You see we're on our way to
Shopton, an' my nephew, Bub, he went along. We thought you was some of
them sassy automobile fellers at first when you hollered to us you
wanted to pass. Then when we looked back, we seen them burglars goin'
t' rob you, at least that's what we suspicioned," and he paused
suggestively.

"That was it," Tom said.

"Wa'al, when we seen that, we held a sort of consultation on thet load
of hay, where they couldn't see us. It was so big you know," he
needlessly explained. "Wa'al, we calcalated we could help you, so I
jest quietly backed up, until we was near enough.  I told Bub to take
the long whip, an' crack it for all he was wuth, so's it would sound
like reinforcements approachin' with guns, an' he done it."

"He certainly done it," added Burt.

"Wa'al," resumed Mr. Lyon, "then me an my sons we jest slipped down off
the front seat, an' come a runnin' with our pitchforks.  I reckoned
them burglars would run when they see us an' heard us, an' they done
so."

"Yep, they done so," added Ade, like an echo.

"I can't tell you how much obliged we are to you," said Mr. Damon. "We
have sixty thousand dollars in this valise, and they would have had it
in another minute, and the bank would have failed."

"Sixty thousand dollars!" gasped Mr. Lyon, and his sons and nephew
echoed the words. Mr. Damon briefly explained about the money, and he
and the young inventor again thanked their rescuers, who had so
unexpectedly, and in such a novel manner, put the thieves to flight.

"An' you've got t' git t' Shopton before three o'clock with thet cash?"
asked Mr. Lyon.

"That's what we hoped to do," replied Tom "but I'm afraid we won't now.
It's half past two, and--"

"Don't say another word," interrupted Mr. Lyon. "I know what ye mean.
My hay's in the road. But don't let that worry ye none.  I'll pull out
of your road in a jiffy, an' if we do go down in th' ditch, why we can
throw off part of th' load, lighten th' wagon, an' pull out again.
You've got t' hustle if ye git t' Shopton by three o'clock."

"I can do it with a clear road," declared Tom, confidently.

"Then ye'll have th' clear road," Mr. Lyon assured him. "Come boys,
let's git th' hay t' one side."

The farmers pulled into the ditch. As they had feared the wagon went in
almost to the hubs, but they did not mind, and, even as Tom and Mr.
Damon shot past them, they fell to work tossing off part of the fodder,
to lighten the wagon. The young inventor and his companion waved a
grateful farewell to them as they fairly tore past, for Tom had turned
on almost the full current.

"Do you suppose that was the Happy Harry gang, or some members of it
who were not captured and sent to jail?" asked Mr. Damon.

"I don't believe so," answered the lad, shaking his head.  "Maybe they
didn't really want to rob us. Perhaps they only wanted to delay us so
we wouldn't get to the bank on time."

"Bless my top knot, you may be right!" cried Mr. Damon.

Further conversation became difficult, as they struck a rough part of
the road, where the vehicle swayed and jolted to an alarming degree.
But Tom never slackened pace. On and on they rushed, Mr. Damon
frequently looking at his watch.

"We've got twenty minutes left," he remarked as they came out on the
smooth stretch of road, that led directly into Shopton.

Then Tom turned all the reserve power into the motor. The machinery
almost groaned as the current surged into the wires, but it took up the
load, and the electric car, swaying more than ever, dashed ahead with
its burden of wealth.

Now they were in the town, now speeding down the street leading to the
bank. One or two policemen shouted after them, for they were violating
the speed laws, but it was no time to stop for that. On and on they
dashed.

They came in sight of the bank. A long line of persons was still in
front. They seemed more excited than in the morning, for the hour of
three was approaching, and they feared the bank would close its doors,
never to open them again.

"The run is still on," observed Mr. Damon.

"But it will soon be over," predicted Tom.

Some news of the errand of the automobile must have penetrated the
crowd, for as Tom swung past the front entrance to the bank, to go up
the rear alley, he was greeted with a cheer.

"They've got the cash!" a man cried. "I'm satisfied now. I won't draw
out my deposit."

"I want to see the cash before I'll believe it," said another.

Tom slowed up to make the turn into the alley. As he did so he glanced
across the street to the new bank. In the window stood Andy Foger and
his father. There was a look of surprise on their faces as they saw the
arrival of the powerful car, and, Tom fancied, also a look of chagrin.

Up the alley went the car, police keeping the crowd from following. The
porter was at the door. So, also, was Mr. Pendergast and Mr. Swift,
while some of the other officers were grouped behind them.

"Did you get the money?" gasped the president.

"We did," answered Tom. "Are we on time, Dad?"

"Just on time, my boy! They're paying out the last of the cash now!
You're on time, thank fortune!"




CHAPTER XXI

OFF TO THE BIG RACE


From their task of handing out money to eager depositors, the wearied
tellers looked up as Tom and Mr. Damon entered with the big valise
crammed full of money. It was opened, and the bundles of bills turned
out on a table.

"Perhaps you'd better make an announcement to the crowd, Mr.
Pendergast," suggested Mr. Swift. "Tell them we now have cash enough to
meet all demands, and that the bank will be kept open until every one
is paid."

"I will," agreed the aged president. His announcement was received with
cheers, and had exactly the effect the inventor hoped it would.

Many, learning that the bank was safe, and that they could have their
money whenever they wanted it, concluded not to withdraw it, thus
saving the interest. Scores in the waiting crowd turned out of line and
went home. Their example was contagious, and, though many still
remained to get their deposits, the run was broken. Only part of the
sixty thousand dollars Tom and Mr. Damon had brought through after a
race with time, was needed. But had it not been for the moral effect of
the cash arriving as it did, the bank would have failed.

"You have a great car, Tom Swift," complimented Mr. Pendergast, when
the excitement had somewhat cooled down, and the story of the hold-up
had been told.

"I think so myself," agreed the young inventor modestly. "I must get
ready for the races now."

"And as for those farmers, I think I'll send them a reward," went on
the president. "They deserve something for the trouble they had with
the load of hay. I certainly shall send them a reward," which he did,
and a substantial one, too.

Of course the hold-up was at once reported to the police after the run
had quieted down, but Chief Simonson surprised Tom by saying that he
had expected it.

"The gang that held you up," said the police officer, "was one that
escaped from a jail, about twenty miles away. I got a tip after you
left, that they were going to rob you, for, in some way, they learned
about the money you and Mr. Damon were to bring from the bank. The
unfortunate part of it was that the tip I got was to the effect that
the hold-up would take place just outside of Clayton. I telephoned to
the police there, just after you left, and they said they'd send out a
posse. But the gang changed their plans; and held you up near here,
where I wasn't expecting it. But I'll get 'em yet."

Chief Simonson did not arrest the gang, but some other police officers
did, and they were taken back to jail. They were not prosecuted for the
attempted robbery of Tom, as it was considered difficult to fix the
guilt on them, but they received such a long additional sentence for
breaking jail, that it will be many years before they are released.

When Tom reached home that night he found some mail from the officials
of the Touring Club of America. It was to the effect that arrangements
for the big contest had been completed, and that contesting cars must
be on the ground by September first.

"That gives me two weeks yet," thought our hero.

He read further of the regulations covering the race. Each car must
proceed from the home town or city of the owner, and go to the track
under its own power. This was a new regulation, it was stated, and was
adopted to better develop the industry of building electric autos. Two
passengers, or one in addition to the driver, must be carried, it was
stated, and this one would also be expected to be in the car during the
entire race.

Regarding the race proper it was stated that at first it had been
decided to make it a twenty-four hour endurance contest, but that for
certain reasons this was changed, as it was found that few storage
batteries could go this length of time without a number of rechargings.
Therefore the race was to be one for distance--five hundred miles, on
the new Long Island track, and the car first covering that distance
would win. Cars were allowed to change their batteries as often as they
needed to, but all time lost would count against them. There were other
rules and regulations of minor importance.

"Well," remarked Tom, as he read through the circulars, "I must get my
car in shape. It will be quite a trip to Long Island, and I think my
best plan will be to go direct to the cottage we had when we were
building the submarine, and from there proceed to the track. That will
comply with the rules, I think. But who will I get to go with me? I
suppose Mr. Damon or Mr. Sharp will be willing. I'll ask them."

He broached the matter to his two friends that night, and they both
agreed to go to Long Island in the car, though only Mr. Sharp would
accompany Tom in the race. The next two weeks were busy ones for Tom.
He worked night and day over his car, getting it in shape for the big
event.

The young inventor made some changes in his battery, and also adopted a
new gear, which would give greater speed. He also completed the
exterior of the auto, giving it several coats of purple paint and
varnish, so that when it was finished, though it was different in shape
from most autos, it was as fine an appearing car as one could wish. He
arranged to carry two extra wheels, with tires inflated, and, under the
rear seats, or tonneau, as he called it, Tom fitted up a complete
tire-repairing outfit. Mr. Sharp agreed to ride there, and in case
there was need to use more than two spare wheels during the race, the
rubber shoes or inner tubes could be mended while the car was swinging
around the track.

Mr. Damon would ride in front with Tom on the cross-country trip, and
occasionally relieve him at steering, or would help to manage the
electrical connections. Spare fuses, extra parts, wires and different
things he thought he might need, the young inventor stored in his car.
He also found means to install a small additional storage battery, to
give added power in case of emergency.

Tom learned from the racing officials that if he made a trip from
Shopton to the cottage on the coast, near the city of Atlantis, and
later traveled from there to the track, it would fulfill the conditions
of the contest.

Finally all was in readiness, and one morning, having spent the better
part of the night going over his machine, to see that he had forgotten
nothing, Tom invited Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp to enter, and prepare for
the trip to Long Island.

"Well, Tom, I certainly hope you win that race," remarked Mrs. Baggert,
as she stood in the doorway, waving a farewell.

"If I do I'll buy you a pair of diamond earrings to match the diamond
ring I gave you from the money I got from the wreck," promised the lad
with a laugh.

"An' ef yo' sees dat Andy Foger," added Eradicate Sampson, while he
rubbed the long ears of Boomerang, his mule, "ef yo' sees him, jest run
ober him once or twice fer mah sake, Mistah Swift."

"I'll do it for my own, too," agreed Tom.

The youth shook hands with his father, who wished him good luck, and
then, after a final look at his car, he climbed to his seat, and turned
on the power. There was a low hum from the motor and the electric
started off. Would it return a winner or loser of the big race?




CHAPTER XXII

IN A DITCH


Through the streets of Shopton went Tom Swift and his friends.  News of
the big contest the young inventor was about to take part in, had
circulated around town, and there were not wanting many to wish him
good luck. The lad responded smilingly to the farewells he received. As
they passed the bank, Ned Newton came out on the steps.

"Wish I was going along," he called.

"So do I," replied Tom. "How's everything? Is the bank all right since
the run?" for he had not had time to pay much attention to the
institution since his memorable race against time, to get the money.

"Stronger and better than ever," was Ned's answer, as he came to the
curb, where Tom slowed up. "I hear," he added in a whisper, "that the
other fellows are going out of business--Foger and his crowd you know.
They loaned money on unsecured notes to make a good showing, and now
they can't get it back. But we're all right. Hope you win the race."

"So do I."

"What will a certain person do while you're away?" went on Ned, with a
wink.

"I don't know what you mean," replied Tom, trying not to blush.  "Do
you mean my dad or Mrs. Baggert?"

"Neither, you old hypocrite you! I meant Miss Mary Nestor."

"Oh, hadn't you heard?" inquired Tom innocently. "She is going to Long
Island to visit some friends, and she'll be at the race."

"You lucky dog," murmured Ned with a laugh, as he went into the bank.

Once more the electric auto started off, and was soon on the quiet
country road, where Tom speeded it up moderately. He hoped to be able
to make the entire distance to the shore cottage on the single charge
of current he had put into the battery at home, and, as there was no
special need for haste, he wanted to save his power. The machine was
running smoothly, and seemed able to make a long race against time.

The travelers ate lunch that day at Pendleton, a town some distance
from Shopton. They had covered a substantial part of their trip. After
a brief rest they started on again. Tom had planned to spend two days
and one night on the road, hoping to be able to reach the shore cottage
on the evening of the second day.  There, after recharging the battery,
he would spend a night, or two, and proceed to the track, ready for the
race.

They found the roads fairly good, with bad stretches here and there,
which made it necessary for them to slow down. This delayed them, and
they found the shadows lengthening, and darkness approaching, when they
were still several miles from Burgfield, where they intended to sleep.

"Will it be all right to travel at night?" asked Mr. Damon, a bit
nervously.

"Why, are you thinking of hold-up men?" inquired Mr. Sharp.

"No, but I was wondering about the condition of the roads," replied the
eccentric man. "We don't want to run into a rock, or collide with
something."

"I guess this will light up the road far enough in advance, so that we
can see where we are going," suggested Tom, as he switched on the
powerful electric search-light. Though it was not dark enough to
illuminate the highway to the best advantage, the powerful gleam shone
dazzlingly in front of the swiftly moving auto.

"I guess that will show up every pebble in the road," commented the
balloonist. "It's very powerful."

Tom turned off the light, as, until it was darker, he could see to
better advantage unaided by it. He slowed down the speed somewhat, but
was still going at a good rate.

"There's a bridge somewhere about here," remarked the lad, when they
had gone on a mile further. "I remember seeing it on my road map. It's
not very strong, and we'll have to run slow over it."

"Bless my gizzard, I hope we don't go through it!" cried Mr. Damon. "Is
your car very heavy, Tom?"

"Not heavy enough to break the bridge. Ah, there it is. Guess I'll turn
on the light so we can see what we're doing."

Just ahead of them loomed up the super-structure of a bridge, and Tom
turned the searchlight switch. At the instant he did so, whether he did
not keep a steady hand on the steering wheel, or whether the auto went
into a rut from which it could not be turned, did not immediately
develop, but the car suddenly shot from the straight road, and swerved
to one side. There was a lurch, and the front wheels sank down.

"Look out! We're going into the river!" yelled Mr. Damon.

Tom jammed on the brakes and shut off the current. The auto came to a
sudden stop. The young inventor turned the searchlight downward, to
illuminate the ground directly in front of the car.

"Are we in the river?" asked Mr. Sharp.

"No," replied Tom in great chagrin. "We're in a muddy ditch.  One at
the side of the road. Wheels in over the hubs! There should have been a
guard rail here. We're stuck for fair!"




CHAPTER XXIII

THE POWER GONE


"Bless my overshoes!" cried Mr. Damon. "Stuck in the mud, eh?"

"Hard and fast," added Tom, in disgust.

"What's to be done?" inquired Mr. Sharp.

"I should say we'll have to stay here until daylight, and wait for some
other auto to come along and pull us out," was Mr. Damon's opinion.
"It's might unpleasant, too, for there doesn't seem to be any place
around here where we can spend the night in any kind of comfort. If we
had the submarine or the airship, now, it wouldn't so much matter."

"No, and this won't matter a great deal," remarked the young inventor
quickly. "We'll soon be out of this, but it will be hard work."

"What do you mean?" asked Mr. Sharp.

"I mean that we've got to pull ourselves out of this mud hole,"
explained the lad, as he prepared to descend. "I was afraid something
like this would happen, so I came prepared for it. I've got ropes and
pulleys with me, in the car. We'll fasten the rope to the machine,
attach one pulley to the bridge, another to the car, and I guess we can
get out of the mud. We'll try, anyhow."

"Well, I must say you looked pretty far ahead," complimented Mr. Damon.

From a box under the tonneau Tom took out a thin but strong rope and
two compound pulleys, which would enable considerable force to be
applied. Mr. Sharp detached one of the powerful oil lamps, and the
three travelers took a look at the auto. It was indeed deep in the mud
and it seemed like a hopeless task to try to get it out unaided. But
Tom insisted that they could do it, and the rope was soon attached, the
hook of one pulley being slipped around one of the braces of the bridge.

"Now, all together!" cried the lad, as he and his friends grasped the
long rope. They gave a great heave. At first it seemed like pulling on
a stone wall. The rope strained and the pulleys creaked.

"I--guess--we--will--pull--the--bridge--over!" gasped Mr. Sharp.

"Something's got to give way!" puffed Tom. "Now, once more! All
together!"

Suddenly they felt the rope moving. The pulleys creaked still more and,
by the light of the lamp, they could see that the auto was slowly being
pulled backward, out of the mud, and onto the hard road. In a few
minutes it was ready to proceed again.

The rope and pulleys were put away, and, after Tom had made an
examination of the car to see that it had sustained no damage, they
were off again, making good time to the hotel in Burgfield, where they
spent the night. They had an early breakfast, and, as Tom went out to
the barn to look at his car, he saw it surrounded by a curious throng
of men and boys. One of the boys was turning some of the handles and
levers.

"Here! Quit that!" yelled Tom, and the meddlesome lad leaped down in
fright. "Do you want to start the car and have it smash into
something?" demanded the young inventor.

"Aw, nothin' happened," retorted the lad. "I pulled every handle on it,
an' it didn't move."

"Good reason," murmured Tom, for he had taken the precaution to remove
a connecting plug, without which the machine could not be started.

The three were soon under way again, and covered many miles over the
fine country roads, the weather conditions being delightful. On inquiry
they found that by taking an infrequently used highway, they could save
several miles. It was over an unoccupied part of country, rather wild
and desolate, but they did not mind that.

They were whizzing along, talking of Tom's chances for winning the race
when, after climbing a slight grade, the auto came to a sudden stop on
the summit.

"What's the matter?" asked Mr. Sharp. "Why are you stopping here, Tom?"

"I didn't stop," was the surprising answer, and the lad shoved the
starting lever back and forth.

But there was no response. There was no hum from the motor. The machine
was "dead."

"That's queer," murmured the young inventor.

"Maybe a fuse blew out," suggested Mr. Damon, that seeming to be his
favorite form of trouble.

"If it had you'd have known it," remarked Mr. Sharp.

"There's plenty of current in the battery, according to the registering
gauge," murmured the lad. "I can't understand it."  He reversed the
current, thinking the wires might have become crossed, but the machine
would move neither backward nor forward, yet the dial indicated that
there was enough power stored away to send it a hundred miles or more.

"Perhaps the dial hand has become caught," suggested Mr. Sharp.  "That
sometimes happens on a steam gauge, and indicates a high pressure when
there isn't any. Hit it slightly, and see if the hand swings back."

Tom did so. At once the hand fell to zero, indicating that there was
not an ampere of current left. The battery was exhausted, but this fact
had not been indicated on the gauge.

"I see now!" cried Tom. "It was those fellows at the hotel barn! They
monkeyed with the mechanism, short circuited the battery, and jammed
the gauge so I couldn't tell when my power was gone. If I had known
there wasn't enough to carry us I could have recharged the battery at
the hotel. But I figured that I had enough current for the entire trip,
and so there would have been, if it hadn't leaked away. Now we're in a
pretty pickle."

"Bless my hat band!" cried Mr. Damon. "Does that mean we can't move?"

"Guess that's about it," answered Mr. Sharp, and Tom nodded.

"Well, why can't we go on to some place where they sell electricity,
and get enough to take us where we want to go?" asked the odd
character, whose ideas of machinery were somewhat hazy.

"The only trouble is we can't carry the heavy car with us," replied
Tom. "It's too big to pick up and take to a charging station."

"Then we've got to wait until some one comes along with a team of
horses, and tows us in," commented Mr. Sharp. "And that will be some
time, on this lonely road."

Tom shook his head despondently. He went all over the car again, but
was forced to the first conclusion, that the reserve current had leaked
away, in consequence of the meddling prank of the youth at the hotel.
The situation was far from pleasant, and the delay would seriously
interfere with their plans.

Suddenly, as Tom was pacing up and down the road, he heard from afar, a
peculiar humming sound. He paused to listen.

"Trolley car," observed Mr. Sharp. "Maybe one of us could go somewhere
on the trolley and get help. There it is," and he pointed to the
electric vehicle, moving along about half a mile away, at the foot of a
gentle slope.

At the sight of the car Tom uttered a cry. "I have it!" he exclaimed.
"None of us need go for help! It's right at hand!" His companions
looked curiously, as the young inventor pointed triumphantly to the
fast disappearing electric.




CHAPTER XXIV

ON THE TRACK


"What do you mean?" asked Mr. Damon. "Will the electric trolley pull us
to a charging station?"

"No, we'll not need to go to a station," answered the youth.  "If we
can get my car to the trolley tracks I can charge my battery from
there. And I think we can push the auto near enough.  It's down hill,
and I've got a long wire so we won't have to go too close."

"Good!" cried Mr. Sharp. "But attach the rope to the front of the car,
Tom. Mr. Damon and I will pull it. You'll have to ride in it to steer
it."

"We can take turns at riding," was Tom's answer, for he did not want
his companions to do all the work.

"Nonsense! You ride," said Mr. Damon. "You're lighter than we are, and
can steer better. It won't be any trouble at all to pull this car down
hill."

It proved to be an easy task, and in a short time the "dead" auto was
near enough to the electric line to permit Tom to run his charging wire
over to it.

"Why bless my soul!" exclaimed Mr. Damon, looking up. "There's no
overhead trolley wire. The car must run on storage batteries."

"Third rail, more likely," was the opinion of Mr. Sharp and so it
proved.

"I can charge from either the third rail or the trolley wire," declared
Tom, who was insulating his hands in rubber gloves, and getting his
wires ready. In a short time he had the proper connections made, and
the much-needed current was soon flowing into the depleted battery, or
batteries, for there were several sets, though the whole source of
motive power was usually referred to as a "storage battery."

"How long will it take?" asked Mr. Damon.

"About two hours," answered the lad. "We'll probably have to disconnect
our wires several times, whenever a trolley car comes past. By my
system I can recharge the battery very quickly.

"Do you suppose the owners of the road will make any objection?" asked
the balloonist.

"I'm going to pay for the current I use," explained the young inventor.
"I have a meter which tells how much I take."

The hum of an approaching car was heard, and Tom took the wires from
the third rail. The car came to a stop opposite the automobile, the
passengers, as well as the crew, looking curiously at the queer racing
machine. Tom explained to the conductor what was going on, and asked
the fare-collector to notify those in charge of the power station that
all current used would be paid for. The conductor said this would be
satisfactory, he was sure, and the car proceeded, Tom resuming the
charging of his battery.

Allowing plenty of reserve power to accumulate, and making sure that
the gauge would not stick again, and deceive him, the owner of the
speedy electric was soon ready to proceed again. They had been delayed
a little over three hours, for they had to make several shifts, as the
cars came past.

They reached their shore cottage late that night, and, after seeing
that the runabout was safely locked in the big shed where the submarine
had been built, they all went to bed, for they were very tired.

Tom sent word, the next day, to the managers of the race, that he would
be on hand at the time stipulated, and announced that he had made part
of the trip, as required, under the power of the auto itself.

The next day was spent in overhauling the machinery, tightening up some
loose bearings, oiling different parts, and further charging the
battery. Tires were looked to, and the ones on the spare wheels were
gone over to prepare for any emergency that might arise when the race
was started.

On the third day, Tom, Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon, leaving the cottage
completed the trip to Havenford, Long Island, where the new track had
been constructed.

They reached the place shortly before noon, and, if they had been
unaware of the location they could not have missed it, for there were
many autos speeding along the road toward the scene of the race, which
would take place the following day.

Several electric cars passed Tom and his friends, whizzing swiftly by,
but the young inventor was not going to show off his speed until the
time came. Besides, he did not want to run any risks of an accident.
But some of the contestants seemed anxious for impromptu "brushes," and
more than one called to our hero to "speed up and let's see what she
can do." But Tom smiled, and shook his head.

There were many gasolene and some steam autos going out to the new
track, which was considered a remarkable piece of engineering. It was
in the shape of an octagon, and the turns were considered very safe. It
was a five mile track, and to complete the race it would be necessary
to make a hundred circuits.

Through scores of autos Tom and his friends threaded their way, the
young inventor keeping a watchful eye on the various types of machine
with which he would soon have to compete.

There were many kinds. Some were larger and some smaller than his. Many
obviously carried very large batteries, but whether they had the speed
or not was another question. Some, in spurts, seemed to Tom, to be
fully as fast as his own, and he began to have some doubts whether he
would win the race.

"But I'm not going to give up until the five hundredth mile is
finished," he thought, grimly.

They were now in sight of the track, and noted many machines speeding
around it.

"Go on in and try your car, Tom," urged Mr. Sharp.

"Yes, do," added Mr. Damon. "Let's see how it travels."

"I will, after I notify the proper officials that I have arrived,"
decided the lad.

The formalities were soon complied with. Tom received his entry card,
after paying the fee, made affidavit that he had completed the entire
trip from home under his own power, save for the little stretch when
the car was pulled, which did not count against him, and was soon ready
to go on the track. Only electric cars were allowed there.

As the young inventor guided his latest effort in the machine line onto
the big track there were murmurs of surprise from the throngs.

"That's a queer machine," said one.

"Yes, but it looks speedy," was another's opinion.

"There's the car for my money," added a third, pointing to a big red
electric which was certainly whizzing around the track.  Tom noted the
red car. Behind it was a green one, also moving at a fast rate of speed.

"Those will be my nearest rivals," thought the lad, as he guided his
car onto the track. A moment later he was sending the auto ahead at
moderate speed, while the other contestants looked at the new arrival,
as if trying to discover whether in it they would have a dangerous
competitor.




CHAPTER XXV

WINNING THE PRIZE


After making two circuits of the track at moderate speed, Tom turned on
more power, deciding to see how the machine would behave on the turns,
going at a fast speed. As it happened he forged ahead just as the big
red car was coming up behind him.  The driver of it took this for a
challenge and threw his controller handle forward.

"Come on!" he cried to our hero, when even with him.

Tom did not want to decline the invitation, and the impromptu race was
under way. Soon the green car came rushing up, and for two miles the
three kept almost in line. It was evident that neither the green nor
the red car drivers wanted to "open out," until they saw Tom do so.

He was willing to oblige them, and suddenly increased his speed. They
did the same, and went ahead of him. Then Tom turned on a little more
juice and got the lead, but the two men were right after him, and they
see-sawed like this for two more miles.  Then, with a cry the man in
the red car, with a sudden burst of speed, left Tom and the green car
behind. The green car was soon up to its rival, but Tom decided he
would not spurt.

The lad and his friends spent the early part of the night in making a
final inspection of the machinery, finding it in good order. Then, with
his head filled with visions of the race on the morrow Tom went to bed.
He had made inquiries, by telephone, of the friends of Miss Nestor, and
learned that she had not arrived.  Tom felt a distinct sense of
disappointment.

The day of the race could not have been better. It was ideal weather,
and conditions at the track were just right. Tom was up early, and went
over every inch of his car with a nervous dread that he might find
something the matter.

The final details of the race were completed, and the entrants given
their numbers and places. Tom drew a good position, not the best, but
he had no reason to complain. Half an hour before the start he again
telephoned to see if Miss Nestor had arrived, but she had not, and it
was with rather gloomy thoughts that the lad entered his car, in which
Mr. Sharp had already taken his place.  Mr. Damon went to the
grandstand to watch the race.

"I wanted Mary to see me win," thought our hero, for he had grimly set
his mind on coming in ahead.

There was a great crowd in the grandstand and scattered about the big
track, which took in a large extent of territory. In spite of its
size--five  miles  around--it  seemed  solidly packed for the entire
length with autos, containing gay parties who had come to see the
electric contest. There was a band playing gay airs, as Tom guided his
machine through the entrance gate, and onto the track.

The judges made their final inspection. There were twenty cars entered,
but it was obvious that some of them would not last long, as their
battery capacity was not large enough. Their owners might have relied
on recharging, but how they could do this under the usual slow system,
and hope to win, Tom could not see. He hoped to run the entire distance
on the single charge, but, if by some accident part of his current
should leak away, his battery could be charged in a short time, by
means of his new system, to run for a considerable distance, or he
could install a new one already charged, for he had two sets on hand.
Tom glanced over the cars of his competitors. They were to be sent away
in batches, the affair being a handicap one, with time allowance for
the smaller powered cars. Tom noted that his car and the red and the
green ones were in the same bunch. Tom's car was purple.

"Are you all ready?" asked the starter of the first group of races.

"Ready," was the low-voiced response.

"Crack!" went the pistol, and there followed the hum of the motors as
the current set the mechanism to work. Forward went the cars, amid the
crash of the band and the cheers of the crowd. The big race was under
way.

"Do you feel nervous, Tom?" asked Mr. Sharp.

"Not a bit," replied the lad.

Around and around the track flew the speedy electrics. It was evident
that the holding of a meet solely for cars of this character had
brought out many new ideas that would be to the benefit of the
industry. Some cars were "freaks" and others, like Tom's, showed a
distinct advance over previous styles of construction.

A five-hundred mile race around a track is rather a monotonous affair,
except for what happens, and things very soon began to happen at this
race.

As Tom had expected, several of the machines were forced to withdraw.
Tire troubles beset some, and others found that they were hopelessly
out of it because of low power, or lack of battery capacity.

Tom determined not to let the red or the green car gain any advantage
over him, and so he watched those two vehicles narrowly. On the other
hand, the red and the green electrics were evidently afraid of one
another and of Tom.

They all three kept pretty much together for the first thirty miles. By
this time the race had settled down into a steady grind. There was some
excitement when the steering gear of one car broke, and it crashed into
the fence, injuring the driver, but the race went on.

The young inventor was holding his own with his two chief rivals, and
was feeling rather proud of his car, when there came from it a report
like a pistol shot.

"Blow out!" yelled Tom desperately, steering to one of the several
repair stations on the inner side of the track. "Be ready with the
extra wheel, Mr. Sharp!"

"Right you are!" cried the balloonist. The car was scarcely stopped
when he had leaped out, and had the lifting jack under the left rear
wheel, where the tire had gone to the bad. He and Tom labored like
Trojans to take off the wheel, and put on the other. They lost five
minutes, and when they got under way again the red and the green cars
were three quarters of a lap ahead.

"You've got to catch them!" declared Sharp firmly.

But the red and the green car drivers saw their advantage, and were
determined to hold it. Tom could not catch them without going his
limit, and he did not want to do this just yet.  However, he had his
opportunity when about two hundred miles had been covered. Both the red
and the green cars had tire troubles, but the red one was delayed
scarcely two minutes as there was a corps of mechanics on hand to take
off the defective wheel and put on another. Still Tom regained his lost
ground, and once more the race between those three cars was even.

In the rear of Tom's car Mr. Sharp was mending the blown-out tire,
though there was still one spare wheel on reserve. Tom, in front,
peered eagerly at the track. Nearly side by side raced the red and the
green cars, the latter somewhat to the rear.

It was at the three hundred and fiftieth mile that Tom had another
blow-out. This time it took a little longer to change the wheel, and
the red and green cars gained a full lap on him. The track was now so
dusty that it was difficult to see the contesting cars. Many had
dropped out, and more were on the verge of giving up.

With the odds against him, Tom started in to regain the lost ground.
Narrowly he watched his electric power. Slowly he saw it dropping.
Would he have enough left to finish out the race? He feared not. The
hours were passing. Still there was a hundred miles yet to go twenty
circuits of the track. Some of the spectators were getting weary and
leaving. The band played spasmodically.

Suddenly Tom saw the red car shoot to one side of the track, toward a
charging station; The green car followed.

"That's our cue!" cried the young inventor "We need a little more
'juice' and now is the time to get it."

The lad ran to the shed where his charging wires were, and they were
connected in a trice. He allowed twenty-five minutes for the charging,
as he knew with his improved battery he could get enough current in
that time to finish the contest. Before the red and green car drivers
had finished installing new batteries, for they could not recharge as
quickly as could our hero, Tom was on the track again. But, in a little
while, his two rivals were after him.

It was now a spectacular race. Around and around swept the three big
cars. All the others were practically out of it. The crowd became
lively airs. Mile after mile was reeled off. The day was passing. Tired
and covered with dust from the track, Tom still sat at the steering
wheel.

"Two laps more!" cried Mr. Sharp, as the starter's pistol gave this
warning. "Can you get away from 'em, Tom?"

The red and the green cars were following closely. The young inventor
looked back and nodded. He turned on more power, almost to the
limit--that he was saving for the final spurt. But after him still came
the two big cars. Suddenly the red car shot ahead, just as the last lap
was beginning. The green tried to follow, but there was a flash of
fire, a loud report, and Tom knew a fuse had blown out. There was no
time for his rival to put in a new one. The race was now between Tom
and the red car. Could the lad catch and pass it?

They were now only a mile from the finish. The red car was three
lengths ahead. With a quick motion Tom turned on the last bit of power.
There seemed to come a roar from his motor and his car shot ahead. It
was on even terms with the red car when what Tom had been fearing for
the last five minutes happened: his fuse blew out.

"Too bad! It's all up with us!" cried Mr. Sharp.

"No!" cried Tom in a ringing voice. "I've got an emergency fuse ready!"
He snapped a switch in place, putting into commission another fuse. The
motor that had lost speed began to pick it up again. Tom had pulled
back the controller handle, but he now shoved it forward again, notch
by notch, until it was at the limit. He had fallen back from the red
car, and the occupants of that, with a yell of triumph, prepared to
cross the line a winner.

But, like a race horse that nerves himself for the last desperate
spurt, Tom's machine fairly leaped ahead. With his hands gripping the
rim of the steering wheel, until it seemed that the bones of his
fingers would protrude, Tom sent his car straight for the finishing
tape. There was a yell from the spectators. Men were standing up,
waving their hats and shouting.  Women were fairly screaming. Mr. Damon
was blessing everything within sight. Mr. Sharp, in his excitement, was
pushing on the back of the front seats as if to shove the car ahead.

Then, as the pistol announced the close of the race, Tom's car, with
what seemed a mighty leap, like a hunter clearing a ditch, forged
ahead, and crossed the line a length in advance of the red car. Tom
Swift had Won.

Amid the cheers of the crowd the lad slowed up, and, at the direction
of the judges, wheeled back to the stand, to receive the prize. A
certified check for three thousand dollars was handed him, and he
received the congratulations of the racing officials. The driver of the
red car also generously praised him.

"You won fair and square," he said, shaking hands with Tom.

The young inventor and his friends drove their car to their shed. As
Tom was descending, weary and begrimed with dust he heard a voice
asking:

"Mayn't I congratulate you also?"

He wheeled around, to confront Mary Nestor, immaculate in a summer gown.

"Why--why," he stammered. "I--I thought you didn't come."

"Oh, yes I did," she answered, laughing. "I wouldn't have missed it for
anything. I arrived late, but I saw the whole race.  Wasn't it
glorious. I'm so glad you won!"  Tom was too, now, but he shrank back
when Miss Nestor held out both daintily gloved hands to him. His hands
were covered with oil and dirt.

"As if I cared for my gloves!" she cried, and she took possession of
his hands, a proceeding to which Tom was nothing loath. "Are you going
to race any more?" she asked, as he walked along by her side, away from
the gathering crowd.

"I don't know," he replied. "My car is speedier than I thought it was.
Perhaps I may enter it in other contests."

But what Tom Swift did later on will be told in another volume, to be
called, "Tom Swift and His Wireless Message; or, The Castaways of
Earthquake Island"--a strange tale of ship-wreck and mystery.

The run back home was made without incident, save for a broken chain,
easily repaired, the day following the race, and Tom later received a
number of invitations to give exhibitions of speed.  Several automobile
manufacturers wanted to secure the rights to his machine, but he said
he desired to consider the matter before acting. He did not forget his
promise to Mrs. Baggert, regarding the diamond earrings, and bought her
the finest pair he could find.

"Come on, Mr. Sharp," proposed Tom, a week or so after the big race,
"let's go for a spin in the airship. I want to see how it feels to be
among the clouds once more," and they were soon soaring aloft.

The new bank, started by Mr. Foger, did not flourish long. It closed
its doors in less than six months, but the old institution was stronger
than ever. Mr. Berg disappeared, and Tom never learned whether the
agent really was the man he had chased, and whose watch charm he tore
loose, though he always had his suspicions. Nor did it ever develop who
crossed the electric wires, so that Tom was so nearly fatally shocked.
Andy Foger disliked our hero more than ever, and on several occasions
caused him not a little trouble, but Tom was able to look after himself.

CHAPTER I

AN APPEAL FOR AID


Tom Swift stepped from the door of the machine shop, where he was at
work making some adjustments to the motor of his airship, and
glanced down the road. He saw a cloud of dust, which effectually
concealed whatever was causing it.

"Some one must be in a hurry this morning," the lad remarked, "Looks
like a motor speeding along. MY! but we certainly do need rain," he
added, as he looked up toward the sky. "It's very dusty. Well, I may
as well get back to work. I'll take the airship out for a flight
this afternoon, if the wind dies down a bit."

The young inventor, for Tom Swift himself had built the airship, as
well as several other crafts for swift locomotion, turned to
re-enter the shop.

Something about the approaching cloud of dust, however, held his
attention. He glanced more intently at it.

"If it's an automobile coming along," he murmured, "it's moving very
slowly, to make so much fuss. And I never saw a motor-cycle that
would kick up as much sand, and not speed along more. It ought to be
here by now. I wonder what it can be?"

The cloud of highway dirt rolled along, making some progress toward
Tom's house and the group of shops and other buildings surrounding
it. But, as the lad had said, the dust did not move at all quickly
in comparison to any of the speedy machines that might be causing
it. And the cloud seemed momentarily to grow thicker and thicker.

"I wonder if it could be a miniature tornado, or a cyclone or
whirlwind?" and Tom spoke aloud, a habit of his when he was
thinking, and had no one to talk to. "Yet it can hardly be that." he
went on. "Guess I'll watch and see what it is."

Nearer and nearer came the dust cloud. Tom peered anxiously ahead, a
puzzled look on his face. A few seconds later there came from the
midst of the obscuring cloud a voice, exclaiming:

"G'lang there now, Boomerang! Keep to' feet a-movin' an' we sho'
will make a record. 'Tain't laik we was a autermobiler, er a
electricity car, but we sho' hab been goin' sence we started. Yo'
sho' done yo'se'f proud t'day, Boomerang, an' I'se gwine t' keep mah
promise an' gib yo' de bestest oats I kin find. Ah reckon Massa Tom
Swift will done say we brought dis yeah message t' him as quick as
anybody could."

Then there followed the sound of hoofbeats on the dusty road, and
the rattle of some many-jointed vehicle, with loose springs and
looser wheels.

"Eradicate Sampson!" exclaimed Tom. "But who would ever think that
the colored man's mule could get up such speed as that cloud of dust
indicates. His mule's feet must be working overtime, but he goes
backward about as often as he moves forward. That accounts for it.
There's lots of dust, but not much motion."

Once more, from the midst of the ball-like cloud of dirt came the
voice of the colored man:

"Now behave yo'se'f, Boomerang. We'm almost dere an' den yo' kin sit
down an' rest if yo' laik. Jest keep it up a little longer, an'
we'll gib Massa Tom his telephone. G'lang now, Boomerang."

The tattoo of hoofbeats was slowing up now, and the cloud of dust
was not so heavy. It was gradually blowing away. Tom Swift walked
down to the fence that separated the house, grounds and shops from
the road. As he got there the sounds of the mule's progress, and the
rattle of the wagon, suddenly ceased.

"G'lang! G'lang! Don't yo' dare t' stop now, when we am most dere!"
cried Eradicate Sampson. "Keep a-movin', Boomerang!"

"It's all right, Eradicate. I'm here," called Tom, and when the last
of the dust had blown away, the lad waved his hand to an aged
colored man, who sat upon the seat of perhaps the most dilapidated
wagon that was ever dignified by such a name. It was held together
with bits of wire, rope and strings, and each of the four wheels
leaned out at a different angle. It was drawn by a big mule, whose
bones seemed protruding through his skin, but that fact evidently
worried him but little, for now the animal was placidly sleeping,
while standing up, his long ears moving slowly to and fro.

"Am dat yo', Massa Tom?" asked Eradicate, ceasing his task of
jerking on the lines, to which operation the mule paid not the least
attention.

"Yes, I'm here, Rad," replied Tom, smiling. "I came out of my shop
to see what all the excitement was about. How did you ever get your
mule to make so much dust?"

"I done promise him an extra helpin' ob oats ef he make good time,"
said the colored man. "An' he done it, too. Did yo' see de dust we
made?"

"I sure did, but you didn't do much else. And you didn't make very
good time. I watched you, and you came along like an ice wagon after
a day's work on the Fourth of July. You were going fast, but moving
slow."

"I 'spects we was, Massa Tom," was the colored man's answer. "But
Boomerang done better dan I 'spected he would. I done tole him yo'd
be in a hurry t' git yo' telephone, an' he sho' did trot along."

"My telephone?" repeated Tom, wonderingly. "What have you and your
mule Boomerang to do with my telephone? That's up in the house."

"No, it ain't! it's right yeah in mah pocket," chuckled Eradicate,
opening a ragged coat, and reaching for something. "I got yo'
telephone right yeah." he went on. "De agent at de station see me
dribin' ober dis way, an' he done ast he t' deliber it. He said as
how he ain't got no messenger boy now, 'cause de one he done hab
went on a strike fo' five cents mo' a day. So I done took de
telephone," and with that the colored man pulled out a crumpled
yellow envelope.

"Oh, you mean a telegram," said Tom, with a laugh, as he took the
message from the odd colored man.

"Well, maybe it's telegraf, but I done understood de agent t' say
telephone. Anyhow, dere it is. An' I s'pects we'd better git along,
Boomerang."

The mule never moved, though Eradicate yanked on the reins, and used
a splintered whip with energy.

"I said as how we'd better git along, Boomerang," went on the
darkey, raising his voice, "Dinnah am mos' ready, an' I'm goin' t'
giv yo' an extra helpin' ob oats."

The effect of these words seemed magical. The mule suddenly came to
life, and was about to start off.

"I done thought dat would cotch yo', Boomerang," chuckled Eradicate.

"Wait a minute, Rad," called Tom, who was tearing open the envelope
of the telegram. "I might want to send an answer back by you. I
wonder who is wiring me now?"

He read the message slowly, and Eradicate remarked:

"'Taint no kind ob use, Massa Tom, fo' t' send a message back wif
me."

"Why not?" asked the young inventor, looking up from the sheet of
yellow paper.

"'Case as how I done promised Boomerang his airman, an' he won't do
nothin' till he has it. Ef I started him back t' town now he would
jest lay down in de road. I'll take de answer back fo' you dis
arternoon."

"All right, perhaps that will do," assented Tom. "I haven't quite
got the hang of this yet. Drop around this afternoon, Rad," and as
the colored man, who, with his mule Boomerang, did odd jobs around
the village, started off down the highway, in another cloud of dust,
Tom Swift resumed the reading of the message.

"Hum, this is rather queer," he mused, when having read it once, he
began at it again. "It must have cost him something to send all this
over the wire. He could just as well have written it. So he wants my
help, eh? Well, I never heard of him, and he may be all right, but I
had other plans, and I don't know whether I can spare the time to go
to Philadelphia or not. I'll have to think it over. An electric
airship, eh? He's sort of following along the lines of my
inventions. Wants my aid--hum--well, I don't know--"

Tom's musings were suddenly cut short by the approach of an elderly
gentleman, who was walking slowly down the path that led from the
house to the country highway which ran in front of it.

"A telegram, Tom?" asked the newcomer.

"Yes, dad," was the reply. "I was just coming in to ask your advice
about it. Eradicate brought it to me."

"What, with his mule, Boomerang?" and the gentleman seemed much
amused. "How did he ever get up speed enough to deliver a telegram?"

"Oh, Eradicate has some special means he uses on his mule when he's
in a hurry. But listen to this message, dad. It's from a Mr. Hosmer
Fenwick, of Philadelphia. He says:"

"'Tom Swift--Can you come on to Philadelphia at once and aid me in
perfecting my new electric airship? I want to get it ready for a
flight before some government experts who have promised to purchase
several if it works well. I am in trouble, and I can't get it to
rise off the ground. I need help. I have heard about your airship,
and the other inventions you and your father have perfected, and I
am sure you can aid me. I am stuck. Can you hurry to the Quaker
City? I will pay you well. Answer at once!'"

"Well?" remarked Mr. Swift, questioningly, as his son finished
reading the telegram. "What are you going to do about it, Tom?"

"I don't exactly know, dad. I was going to ask your advice. What
would you do? Who is this Mr. Fenwick?"

"Well, he is an inventor of some note, but he has had many failures.
I have not heard of him in some years until now. He is a gentleman
of wealth, and can be relied upon to do just as he says. We are
slightly acquainted. Perhaps it would be well to aid him, if you can
spare the time. Not that you need the money, but inventors should be
mutually helpful. If you feel like going to Philadelphia, and aiding
him in getting his electric airship in shape, you have my
permission."

"I don't know," answered Tom, doubtfully. "I was just getting my
monoplane in shape for a little flight. It was nothing particular,
though. Dad, I think I WILL take a run to Philadelphia, and see if I
can help Mr. Fenwick. I'll wire him that I am coming, to-morrow or
next day."

"Very well," assented Mr. Swift, and then he and his son went into
one of the shops, talking of a new invention which they were about
to patent.

Tom little knew what a strange series of adventures were to follow
his decision to go to the Quaker City, nor the danger involved in
aiding Mr. Fenwick to operate his electric airship.




CHAPTER II

MISS NESTOR'S NEWS


"When do you think you will go to Philadelphia, Tom?" asked Mr.
Swift, a little later, as the aged inventor and his son were looking
over some blueprints which Garret Jackson, an engineer employed by
them, had spread out on a table.

"I don't exactly know," was the answer. "It's quite a little run
from Shopton, because I can't get a through train. But I think I'll
start tomorrow."

"Why do you go by train?" asked Mr. Jackson.

"Why--er--because--" was Tom's rather hesitating reply. "How else
would I go?"

"Your monoplane would be a good deal quicker, and you wouldn't have
to change cars," said the engineer. "That is if you don't want to
take out the big airship. Why don't you go in the monoplane?"

"By Jove! I believe I will!" exclaimed Tom. "I never thought of
that, though it's a wonder I didn't. I'll not take the RED CLOUD, as
she's too hard to handle alone. But the BUTTERFLY will be just the
thing," and Tom looked over to where a new monoplane rested on the
three bicycle wheels which formed part of its landing frame. "I
haven't had it out since I mended the left wing tip," he went on,
"and it will also be a good chance to test my new rudder. I believe
I WILL go to Philadelphia by the BUTTERFLY."

"Well, as long as that's settled, suppose you give us your views on
this new form of storage battery," suggested Mr. Swift, with a fond
glance at his son, for Tom's opinion was considered valuable in
matters electrical, as those of you, who have read the previous
books in this series, well know.

The little group in the machine shop was soon deep in the discussion
of ohms, amperes, volts and currents, and, for a time, Tom almost
forgot the message calling him to Philadelphia.

Taking advantage of the momentary lull in the activities of the
young inventor, I will tell my readers something about him, so that
those who have no previous introduction to him may feel that he is a
friend.

Tom Swift lived with his father, Barton Swift, a widower, in the
village of Shopton, New York. There was also in the household Mrs.
Baggert, the aged housekeeper, who looked after Tom almost like a
mother. Garret Jackson, an engineer and general helper, also lived
with the Swifts.

Eradicate Sampson might also be called a retainer of the family, for
though the aged colored man and his mule Boomerang did odd work
about the village, they were more often employed by Tom and his
father than by any one else. Eradicate was so called because, as he
said, he "eradicated" the dirt. He did whitewashing, made gardens,
and did anything else that was needed. Boomerang was thus named by
his owner, because, as Eradicate said, "yo' nebber know jest what
dat mule am goin' t' do next. He may go forward or he may go
backward, jest laik them Australian boomerangs."

There was another valued friend of the family, Wakefield Damon by
name, to whom the reader will be introduced in due course. And then
there was Mary Nestor, about whom I prefer to let Tom tell you
himself, for he might be jealous if I talked too much about her.

In the first book of this series, called "Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle,"
there was told how he became possessed of the machine, after
it had nearly killed Mr. Damon, who was learning to ride it. Mr.
Damon, who had a habit of "blessing" everything from his collar
button to his shoe laces, did not "bless" the motor-cycle after it
tried to climb a tree with him; and he sold it to Tom very cheaply.
Tom repaired it, invented some new attachments for it, and had a
number of adventures on it. Not the least of these was trailing
after a gang of scoundrels who tried to get possession of a valuable
patent model belonging to Mr. Swift.

Our second book, called "Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat," related some
exciting times following the acquisition by the young inventor of a
speedy craft which the thieves of the patent model had stolen. In
the boat Tom raced with Andy Foger, a town bully, and beat him. Tom
also took out on pleasure trips his chum, Ned Newton, who worked in
a Shopton bank, and the two had fine times together. Need I also say
that Mary Nestor also had trips in the motor-boat? Besides some other
stirring adventures in his speedy craft Tom rescued, from a burning
balloon that fell into the lake, the aeronaut, John Sharp. Later Mr.
Sharp and Tom built an airship, called the RED CLOUD, in which they
had some strenuous times.

Their adventures in this craft of the air form the basis for the
third book of the series, entitled "Tom Swift and His Airship." In
the RED CLOUD, Tom and his friends, including Mr. Damon, started to
make a record flight. They left Shopton the night when the bank
vault was blown open, and seventy-five thousand dollars stolen.

Because of evidence given by Andy Foger, and his father, suspicion
pointed to Tom and his friends as the robbers, and they were
pursued. But they turned the tables by capturing the real burglars,
and defeating the mean plans of the Fogers.

Not satisfied with having mastered the air Tom and his father turned
their attention to the water. Mr. Swift perfected a new type of
craft, and in the fourth book of the series, called "Tom Swift and
His Submarine," you may read how he went after a sunken treasure.
The party had many adventures, and were in no little danger from
their enemies before they reached the wreck with its store of gold.

The fifth book of the series, named "Tom Swift and His Electrical
Runabout," told how Tom built the speediest car on the road, and won
a prize with it, and also saved a bank from ruin.

Tom had to struggle against odds, not only in his inventive work,
but because of the meanness of jealous enemies, including Andy
Foger, who seemed to bear our hero a grudge of long standing. Even
though Tom had, more than once, thrashed Andy well, the bully was
always seeking a chance to play some mean trick on the young
inventor. Sometimes he succeeded, but more often the tables were
effectually turned.

It was now some time since Tom had won the prize in his electric car
and, in the meanwhile he had built himself a smaller airship, or,
rather, monoplane, named the BUTTERFLY. In it he made several
successful trips about the country, and gave exhibitions at numerous
aviation meets; once winning a valuable prize for an altitude
flight. In one trip he had met with a slight accident, and the
monoplane had only just been repaired after this when he received
the message summoning him to Philadelphia.

"Well, Tom," remarked his father that afternoon, "if you are going
to the Quaker City, to see Mr. Fenwick to-morrow, you'd better be
getting ready. Have you wired him that you will come?"

"No, I haven't, dad," was the reply. "I'll get a message ready at
once, and when Eradicate comes back I'll have him take it to the
telegraph office."

"I wouldn't do that, Tom."

"Do what?"

"Trust it to Eradicate. He means all right, but there's no telling
when that mule of his may lie down in the road, and go to sleep.
Then your message won't get off, and Mr. Fenwick may be anxiously
waiting for it. I wouldn't like to offend him, for, though he and I
have not met in some years, yet I would be glad if you could do him
a favor. Why not take the message yourself?"

"Guess I will, dad. I'll run over to Mansburg in my electric car,
and send the message from there. It will go quicker, and, besides, I
want to get some piano wire to strengthen the wings of my
monoplane."

"All right, Tom, and when you telegraph to Mr. Fenwick, give him my
regards, and say that I hope his airship will be a success. So it's
an electric one, eh? I wonder how it works? But you can tell me when
you come back."

"I will, dad. Mr. Jackson, will you help me charge the batteries of
my car? I think they need replenishing. Then I'll get right along to
Mansburg."

Mansburg was a good-sized city some miles from the village of
Shopton, and Tom and his father had frequent business there.

The young inventor and the engineer soon had the electric car in
readiness for a swift run, for the charging of the batteries could
be done in much less than the time usual for such an operation,
owing to a new system perfected by Tom. The latter was soon speeding
along the road, wondering what sort of an airship Mr. Fenwick would
prove to have, and whether or not it could be made to fly.

"It's easy enough to build an airship," mused Tom, "but the
difficulty is to get them off the ground, and keep them there." He
knew, for there had been several failures with his monoplane before
it rose like a bird and sailed over the tree-tops.

The lad was just entering the town, and had turned around a corner,
twisting about to pass a milk wagon, when he suddenly saw, darting
out directly in the path of his car, a young lady.

"Look out!" yelled Tom, ringing his electric gong, at the same time
shutting off the current, and jamming on the powerful brakes.

There was a momentary scream of terror from the girl, and then, as
she looked at Tom, she exclaimed:

"Why, Tom Swift! What are you trying to do? Run me down?"

"Mary--Miss Nestor!" ejaculated our hero, in some confusion.

He had brought his car to a stop, and had thrown open the door,
alighting on the crossing, while a little knot of curious people
gathered about.

"I didn't see you," went on the lad. "I came from behind the milk
wagon, and--"

"It was my fault," Miss Nestor hastened to add. "I, too, was waiting
for the milk wagon to pass, and when it got out of my way, I darted
around the end of it, without looking to see if anything else was
coming. I should have been more careful, but I'm so excited that I
hardly know what I'm doing."

"Excited? What's the matter?" asked Tom, for he saw that his friend
was not her usual calm self. "Has anything happened, Mary?"

"Oh, I've such news to tell you!" she exclaimed.

"Then get in here, and we'll go on." advised Tom. "We are collecting
a crowd. Come and take a ride; that is if you have time."

"Of course I have," the girl said, with a little blush, which Tom
thought made her look all the prettier. "Then we can talk. But where
are you going?"

"To send a message to a gentleman in Philadelphia, saying that I
will help him out of some difficulties with his new electric
airship. I'm going to take a run down there in my monoplane,
BUTTERFLY, to-morrow, and--"

"My! to hear you tell it, one would think it wasn't any more to make
an airship flight than it was to go shopping," interrupted Mary, as
she entered the electric car, followed by Tom, who quickly sent the
vehicle down the street.

"Oh, I'm getting used to the upper air," he said. "But what is the
news you were to tell me?"

"Did you know mamma and papa had gone to the West Indies?" asked the
girl.

"No! I should say that WAS news. When did they go? I didn't know
they intended to make a trip."

"Neither did they; nor I, either. It was very sudden. They sailed
from New York yesterday. Mr. George Hosbrook, a business friend of
papa's, offered to take them on his steam yacht, RESOLUTE. He is
making a little pleasure trip, with a party of friends, and he
thought papa and mamma might like to go."

"He wired to them, they got ready in a rush, caught the express to
New York, and went off in such a hurry that I can hardly realize it
yet. I'm left all alone, and I'm in such trouble!"

"Well, I should say that was news," spoke Tom.

"Oh, you haven't heard the worst yet," went on Mary. "I don't call
the fact that papa and mamma went off so suddenly much news. But the
cook just left unexpectedly, and I have invited a lot of girl
friends to come and stay with me, while mamma and papa are away; and
now what shall I do without a cook? I was on my way down to an
intelligence office, to get another servant, when you nearly ran me
down! Now, isn't that news?"

"I should say it was--two kinds," admitted Tom, with a smile. "Well,
I'll help you all I can. I'll take you to the intelligence office,
and if you can get a cook, by hook or by crook, I'll bundle her into
this car, and get her to your house before she can change her mind.
And so your people have gone to the West Indies?"

"Yes, and I wish I had the chance to go."

"So do I," spoke Tom, little realizing how soon his wish might be
granted. "But is there any particular intelligence office you wish
to visit?"

"There's not much choice," replied Mary Nestor, with a smile, "as
there's only one in town. Oh. I do hope I can get a cook! It would
be dreadful to have nothing to eat, after I'd asked the girls to
spend a month with me; wouldn't it?"

Tom agreed that it certainly would, and they soon after arrived at
the intelligence office.




CHAPTER III

TOM KNOCKS OUT ANDY


"Do you want me to come in and help you?" asked the young inventor,
of Miss Nestor.

"Do you know anything about hiring a cook?" she inquired, with an
arch smile.

"I'm afraid I don't," the lad was obliged to confess.

"Then I'm a little doubtful of your ability to help me. But I'm ever
so much obliged to you. I'll see if I can engage one. The cook who
just left went away because I asked her to make some apple
turnovers. Some of the girls who are coming are very fond of them."

"So am I," spoke Tom, with a smile.

"Are you, indeed? Then, if the cook I hope to get now will make
them, I'll invite you over to have some, and--also meet my friends."

"I'd rather come when just you, and the turnovers and the cook are
there," declared Tom, boldly, and Mary, with a blush, made ready to
leave the electric car.

"Thank you," she said, in a low voice.

"If I can't help you select a cook," went on Tom, "at least let me
call and take you home when you have engaged one."

"Oh, it will be too much trouble," protested Miss Nestor.

"Not at all. I have only to send a message, and get some piano wire,
and then I'll call back here for you. I'll take you and the new cook
back home flying."

"All right, but don't fly so fast. The cook may get frightened, and
leave before she has a chance to make an apple turnover."

"I'll go slower. I'll be back in fifteen minutes," called Tom, as he
swung the car out away from the curb, while Mary Nestor went into
the intelligence office.

Tom wrote and sent this message to Mr. Hostner Fenwick, of
Philadelphia:

"Will come on to-morrow in my aeroplane, and aid you all I can. Will
not promise to make your electric airship fly, though. Father sends
regards."

"Just rush that, please," he said to the telegraph agent, and the
latter, after reading it over, remarked:

"It'll rush itself, I reckon, being all about airships, and things
like that," and he laughed as Tom paid him.

Selecting several sizes of piano wire of great strength, to use as
extra guy-braces on the Butterfly, Tom re-entered his electric car,
and hastened back to the intelligence office, where he had left his
friend. He saw her standing at the front door, and before he could
alight, and go to her, Miss Nestor came out to meet him.

"Oh, Tom!" she exclaimed, with a little tragic gesture, "what do you
think?"

"I don't know," he answered good-naturedly. "Does the new cook
refuse to come unless you do away with apple turnovers?"

"No, it isn't that. I have engaged a real treasure, I'm sure, but as
soon as I mentioned that you would take us home in the electric
automobile, she flatly refused to come. She said walking was the
only way she would go. She hasn't been in this country long. But the
worst of it is that a rich woman has just telephoned in for a cook,
and if I don't get this one away, the rich lady may induce her to
come to her house, and I'll be without one! Oh, what shall I do?"
and poor Mary looked quite distressed.

"Humph! So she's afraid of electric autos; eh?" mused Tom. "That's
queer. Leave it to me, Mary, and perhaps I can fix it. You want to
get her away from here in a hurry; don't you?"

"Yes, because servants are so scarce, that they are engaged almost
as soon as they register at the intelligence office. I know the one
I have hired is suspicious of me, since I have mentioned your car,
and she'll surely go with Mrs. Duy Puyster when she comes. I'm sorry
I spoke of the automobile."

"Well, don't worry. It's partly my fault, and perhaps I can make
amends. I'll talk to the new cook," decided the young inventor.

"Oh, Tom, I don't believe it will do any good. She won't come, and
all my girl friends will arrive shortly." Miss Nestor was quite
distressed.

"Leave it to me," suggested the lad, with an assumed confidence he
did not feel. He left the car, and walked toward the office.
Entering it, with Miss Nestor in his wake, he saw a pleasant-faced
Irish girl, sitting on a bench, with a bundle beside her.

"And so you don't want to ride in an auto?" began Tom.

"No, an' it's no use of the likes of you askin' me, either,"
answered the girl, but not impudently. "I am afeered of thim things,
an' I won't work in a family that owns one."

"But we don't own one," said Mary.

The girl only sniffed.

"It is the very latest means of traveling," Tom went on, "and there
is absolutely no danger. I will drive slowly."

"No!" snapped the new cook.

Tom was rather at his wits' ends. At that moment the telephone rang,
and Tom and Mary, listening, could hear the proprietress of the
intelligence office talking to Mrs. Duy Puyster over the wire.

"We must get her away soon," whispered Mary, with a nod at the Irish
girl, "or we'll lose her."

Tom was thinking rapidly, but no plan seemed to come to him. A
moment later one of the assistants of the office led out from a rear
room another Irish girl,--who, it seems, had just engaged herself to
work in the country.

"Good-by, Bridget," said this girl, to the one Mary Nestor had
hired. "I'm off now. The carriage has just come for me. I'm goin'
away in style."

"Good luck, Sarah," wished Bridget.

Tom looked out of the window. A dilapidated farm wagon, drawn by two
rusty-looking horses, just drawing up at the curb.

"There is your employer, Sarah," said the proprietress of the
office. "You will have a nice ride to the country and I hope you
will like the place."

A typical country farmer alighted from the wagon, leaving a woman,
evidently his wife, or the seat. He called out:

"I'll git th' servant-gal, 'Mandy, an' we'll drive right out hum.
Then you won't have such hard work any more."

"An' so that's the style you was tellin' me of; eh, Sarah?" asked
the cook whom Miss Nestor had engaged. "That's queer style, Sarah."

Sarah was blushing from shame and mortification. Tom was quick to
seize the advantage thus offered.

"Bridget, if YOU appreciate style," he said, "you will come in the
automobile. I have one of the very latest models, and it is very
safe. But perhaps you prefer a farm wagon."

"Indade an' I don't!" was the ready response. "I'll go wid you now
if only to show Sarah Malloy thot I have more style than her! She
was boastin' of the fine place she had, an' th' illigant carriage
that was comin' t' take her to the counthry. If that's it I want
none of it! I'll go wid you an' th' young gintleman. Style indade!"
and, gathering up her bundle she followed Tom and Mary to the
waiting auto.

They entered it and started off, just as Mrs. Duy Puyster drove up
in her elegantly appointed carriage, while Sarah, with tears of
mortification in her eyes, climbed up beside the farmer and his
wife.

"You saved the day for me, Tom," whispered Miss Nestor, as the young
inventor increased the speed of his car. "It was only just in time."

"Don't forget the apple turnovers," he whispered back.

Once she had made the plunge, the new cook seemed to lose her fears
of the auto, and enjoyed the ride. In a short time she had been
safely delivered at Miss Nestor's home, while that young lady
repeated her thanks to Tom, and renewed her invitation for him to
come and sample the apple turnovers, which Tom promised faithfully
to do, saying he would call on his return from Philadelphia.

Musing on the amusing feature of his trip, Tom was urging his auto
along at moderate speed, when, as he turned down a country road,
leading to his home, he saw, coming toward him, a carriage, drawn by
a slow-moving, white horse, and containing a solitary figure.

"Why, that looks like Andy Foger," spoke Tom, half aloud. "I wonder
what he's doing out driving? His auto must be out of commission. But
that's not strange, considering the way he abuses the machine. It's
in the repair shop half the time."

He slowed down still more, for he did not know but that Andy's horse
might be skittish. He need have no fears, however, for the animal
did not seem to have much more life than did Eradicate's mule,
Boomerang.

As Tom came nearer the carriage, he was surprised to see Andy
deliberately swing his horse across the road, blocking the highway
by means of the carriage and steed.

"Well, Andy Foger, what does that mean?" cried Tom, indignantly, as
he brought his car to a sudden stop. "Why do you block the road?"

"Because I want to," snarled the bully, taking out a notebook and
pencil, and pretending to make some notes about the property in
front of which he had halted. "I'm in the real estate business now,"
went on Andy, "and I'm getting descriptions of the property I'm
going to sell. Guess I've got a right to stop in the road if I want
to!"

"But not to block it up," retorted Tom. "That's against the law.
Pull over and let me pass!"

"Suppose I don't do it?"

"Then I'll make you!"

"Huh! I'd like to see you try it!" snapped Andy. "If you make
trouble for me, it will be the worse for you."

"If you pull to one side, so I can pass, there'll be no trouble,"
said Tom, seeing that Andy wished to pick a quarrel.

"Well, I'm not going to pull aside until I finish putting down this
description," and the bully continued to write with tantalizing
slowness.

"Look here!" exclaimed Tom Swift, with sudden energy. "I'm not going
to stand for this! Either you pull to one side and let me pass, or--"

"Well, what will you do?" demanded the bully.

"I'll shove you to one side, and you can take the consequences!"

"You won't dare to!"

"I won't, eh? Just you watch."

Tom threw forward the lever of his car. There was a hum of the
motor, and the electric moved ahead. Andy had continued to write in
the book, but at this sound he glanced up.

"Don't you dare to bunk into me!" yelled Andy. "If you do I'll sue
you for damages!"

"Get out of the way, or I'll shove you off the road!" threatened
Tom, calmly.

"I'll not go until I get ready."

"Oh, yes you will," responded our hero quietly. He sent his car
ahead slowly but surely. It was within a few feet of the carriage
containing Andy. The bully had dropped his notebook, and was shaking
his fist at Tom.

As for the young inventor he had his plans made. He saw that the
horse was a quiet, sleepy one, that would not run away, no matter
what happened, and Tom only intended to gently push the carriage to
one side, and pass on.

The front of his auto came up against the other vehicle.

"Here, you stop!" cried Andy, savagely.

"It's too late now," answered Tom, grimly.

Andy reached for the horsewhip. Tom put on a little more power, and
the carriage began to slide across the road, but the old horse never
opened his eyes.

"Take that!" cried Andy, raising his whip, with the intention of
slashing Tom across the face, for the front of the auto was open.
But the blow never fell, for, the next instant, the carriage gave a
lurch as one of the wheels slid against a stone, and, as Andy was
standing up, and leaning forward, he was pitched head first out into
the road.

"By Jove! I hope I haven't hurt him!" gasped Tom, as he leaped from
his auto, which he had brought to a stop.

The young inventor bent over the bully. There was a little cut on
Andy's forehead, and his face was white. He had been most
effectually knocked out entirely by his own meanness and fault, but,
none the less, Tom was frightened. He raised up Andy's head on his
arm, and brushed back his hair. Andy was unconscious.




CHAPTER IV

MR. DAMON WILL GO ALONG


At first Tom was greatly frightened at the sight of Andy's pale
face. He feared lest the bully might be seriously hurt. But when he
realized that the fall from the carriage, which was a low one, was
not hard, and that Andy had landed on his outstretched hands before
his head came in contact with the earth, our hero was somewhat
reassured.

"I wish I had some water, with which to bathe his head," Tom
murmured, and he looked about in vain for some. But it was not
needed, for, a moment later, Andy opened his eyes, and, when he saw
Tom bending over, and holding him, the bully exclaimed:

"Here! You let me go! Don't you hit me again, Tom Swift, or I'll
punch you!"

"I didn't hit you," declared Tom, while Andy tore himself away, and
struggled to his feet.

"Yes, you did, too, hit me!"

"I did not! You tried to strike me with your whip, as I was shoving
your carriage out of the way, which I had a perfect right to do, as
you were blockading the highway. You lost your balance and fell. It
was your own fault."

"Well, you'll suffer for it, just the same, snarled Andy, and then,
putting his hand to his head, and bringing it away, with some drops
of blood on it, he cried out:"

"Oh, I'm hurt! I'm injured! Get a doctor, or maybe I'll bleed to
death!" He began blubbering, for Andy, like all bullies, was a
coward.

"You're not hurt," asserted Tom, trying not to laugh. "It's only a
scratch. Next time don't try to blockade the whole street, and you
won't get into trouble. Are you able to drive home; or shall I take
you in my car?"

"I wouldn't ride in your car!" snapped the ugly lad. "You go on, and
mind your business now, and I'll pay you back for this, some day. I
could have you arrested!"

"And so could I have you locked up for obstructing traffic. But I'll
not. Your rig isn't damaged, and you'd better drive home."

The old white horse had not moved, and was evidently glad of the
rest. A glance satisfied Tom that the carriage had not been damaged,
and, getting into his car, while Andy was brushing the dust from his
clothes, our hero started the motor.

There was now room enough to pass around the obstructing carriage,
and soon Tom was humming down the road, leaving a much discomfited
bully behind him.

"Tom Swift is too smart--thinking he can run everybody, and
everything, to suit himself," growled Andy, as he finished dusting
off his clothes, and wiping the blood from his face. As Tom had
said, the wound was but a scratch, though the bully's head ached,
and he felt a little dizzy. "I wish I'd hit him with the horsewhip,"
he went on, vindictively. "I'll get square with him some day."

Andy had said this many times, but he had never yet succeeded in
permanently getting the best of Tom. Pondering on some scheme of
revenge the rich lad--for Mr. Foger, his father, was quite
wealthy--drove on.

Meanwhile Tom, rather wishing the little encounter had not taken
place, but refusing to blame himself for what had occurred, was
speeding toward home.

"Let's see," he murmured, as he drove along in his powerful car.
"I've got quite a lot to do if I make an early start for
Philadelphia, in my airship, to-morrow. I want to tighten the
propeller on the shaft a trifle, and give the engine a good try-out.
Then, too, I think I'd better make the landing springs a little
stiffer. The last time I made a descent the frame was pretty well
jarred up. Yes, if I make that air trip to-morrow I'll have to do
some tall hustling when I get home."

The electric runabout swung into the yard of the Swift house, and
Tom brought it to a stop opposite the side door. He looked about for
a sight of his father, Mrs. Baggert or Garret Jackson. The only
person visible was Eradicate Sampson, working in the garden.

"Hello, Rad," called Tom. "Anybody home?"

"Yais, Massa Tom," answered the colored man. "Yo' dad an' anodder
gen'mans hab jest gone in de house."

"Who's the other gentleman, Rad?" asked Tom, and the negro, glad of
an excuse to cease the weeding of the onion bed, came shuffling
forward.

"It's de gen'mans what is allers saying his prayers," he answered.

"Saying his prayers?" repeated Tom.

"Yep. Yo' knows what I means, Massa Tom. He's allers askin' a
blessin' on his shoes, or his rubbers, or his necktie."

"Oh, you mean Mr. Wakefield Damon."

"Yais, sah, dat's who I done means. Mr. Wakefull Lemon--dat's sho'
him."

At that moment there sounded, within the house, the voices of Mr.
Swift, and some one else in conversation.

"And so Tom has decided to make a run to the Quaker City in the
BUTTERFLY, to-morrow," Mr. Swift was saying, "and he's going to see
if he can be of any service to this Mr. Fenwick."

"Bless my watch chain!" exclaimed the other voice. "You don't say
so! Why I know Mr. Fenwick very well--he and I used to go to school
together, but bless my multiplication tables--I never thought he'd
amount to anything! And so he's built an airship; and Tom is going
to help him with it? Why, bless my collar button, I've a good notion
to go along and see what happens. Bless my very existence, but I
think I will!"

"That's Mr. Damon all right," observed Tom, with a smile, as he
advanced toward the dining-room, whence the voices proceeded.

"Dat's what I done tole you!" said Eradicate, and, with slow and
lagging steps he went back to weed the onion bed.

"How are you, Mr. Damon," called our hero, as he mounted the steps
of the porch.

"Why, it's Tom--he's back!" exclaimed the eccentric man. "Why, bless
my shoe laces, Tom! how are you? I'm real glad to see you. Bless my
eyeglasses, but I am! I just returned from a little western trip,
and I thought I'd rUn over and see how you are. I came in my car--had
two blowouts on the way, too. Bless my spark plug, but the kind
of tires one gets now-a-days are a disgrace! However, I'm here, and
your father has just told me about you going to Philadelphia in your
monoplane, to help a fellow-inventor with his airship. It's real
kind of you. Bless my topknot if it isn't! Do you know what I was
just saying?"

"I heard you mention that you knew Mr. Fenwick," replied Tom, with a
smile, as he shook hands with Mr. Damon.

"So I do, and, what's more, I'd like to see his airship. Will your
BUTTERFLY carry two passengers?"

"Easily, Mr. Damon."

"Then I'll tell you what I'm going to do. If you'll let me I'll take
that run to Philadelphia with you!"

"Glad to have you come along," responded Tom, heartily.

"Then I'll go, and, what's more, if Fenwick's ship will rise, I'll
go with you in that--bless my deflection rudder if I don't, Tom!"
and puffing up his cheeks, as he exploded these words, Mr. Damon
fairly raised himself on his tiptoes, and shook Tom's hand again.




CHAPTER V

VOL-PLANING TO EARTH


For a moment after Mr. Damon's announcement Tom did not reply. Mr.
Swift, too, seemed a little at a loss for something to say. They did
not quite know how to take their eccentric friend at times.

"Of course I'll be glad of your company, Mr. Damon," said Tom: "but
you must remember that my BUTTERFLY is not like the RED CLOUD. There
is more danger riding in the monoplane than there is in the airship.
In the latter, if the engine happens to stop, the sustaining gas
will prevent us from falling. But it isn't so in an aeroplane. When
your engine stops there--"

"Well, what happens?" asked Mr. Damon, impatiently, for Tom
hesitated.

"You have to vol-plane back to earth."

"Vol-plane?" and there was a questioning note in Mr. Damon's voice.

"Yes, glide down from whatever height you are at when the engine
stalls. Come down in a series of dips from the upper currents.
Vol-planing, the French call it, and I guess it's as good a word as
any."

"Have you ever done it?" asked the odd character.

"Oh, yes, several times."

"Then, bless my fur overcoat! I can do it, too, Tom. When will you
be ready to start?"

"To-morrow morning. Now you are sure you won't get nervous and want
to jump, if the engine happens to break down?"

"Not a bit of it. I'll vol-plane whenever you are ready," and Mr.
Damon laughed.

"Well, we'll hope we won't have to," went on Tom. "And I'll be very
glad of your company. Mr. Fenwick will, no doubt, be pleased to see
you. I've never met him, and it will be nice to have some one to
introduce me. Suppose you come out and see what sort of a craft you
are doomed to travel in to-morrow, Mr. Damon. I believe you never
saw my new monoplane."

"That's right, I haven't, but I'd be glad to. I declare, I'm getting
to be quite an aviator," and Mr. Damon chuckled. A little later,
Tom, having informed his father of the sending of the message, took
his eccentric friend out to the shop, and exhibited the BUTTERFLY.

As many of you have seen the ordinary monoplane, either on
exhibition or in flight, I will not take much space to describe
Tom's. Sufficient to say it was modeled after the one in which
Bleriot made his first flight across the English channel.

The body was not unlike that of a butterfly or dragon fly, long and
slender, consisting of a rectangular frame with canvas stretched
over it, and a seat for two just aft of the engine and controlling
levers. Back of the seat stretched out a long framework, and at the
end was a curved plane, set at right angles to it. The ends of the
plane terminated in flexible wings, to permit of their being bent up
or down, so as to preserve the horizontal equilibrium of the craft.

At the extreme end was the vertical rudder, which sent the monoplane
to left or right.

Forward, almost exactly like the front set of wings of the dragon
fly, was the large, main plane, with the concave turn toward the
ground. There was the usual propeller in front, operated by a four
cylinder motor, the cylinders being air cooled, and set like the
spokes of a wheel around the motor box. The big gasolene tank, and
other mechanism was in front of the right-hand operator's seat,
where Tom always rode. He had seldom taken a passenger up with him,
though the machine would easily carry two, and he was a little
nervous about the outcome of the trip with Mr. Damon.

"How do you like the looks of it?" asked the young inventor, as he
wheeled the BUTTERFLY out of the shed, and began pumping up the
tires of the bicycle wheels on which it ran over the ground, to get
impetus enough with which to rise.

"It looks a little frail, compared to the big RED CLOUD, Tom,"
answered the eccentric man, "but I'm going up in her just the same;
bless my buttons if I'm not."

Tom could not but admire the grit of his friend.

The rest of the day was busily spent making various adjustments to
the monoplane, putting on new wire stays, changing the rudder
cables, and tuning up the motor. The propeller was tightened on the
shaft, and toward evening Tom announced that all was in readiness
for a trial flight.

"Want to come, Mr. Damon?" he asked.

"I'll wait, and see how it acts with you aboard," was the answer.
"Not that I'm afraid, for I'm going to make the trip in the morning,
but perhaps it won't work just right now."

"Oh, I guess it will," ventured Tom, and in order to be able to know
just how his BUTTERFLY was going to behave, with a passenger of Mr.
Damon's weight, the young inventor placed a bag of sand on the extra
seat.

The monoplane was then wheeled to the end of the starting ground.
Tom took his place in the seat, and Mr. Jackson started the
propeller. At first the engine failed to respond, but suddenly with
a burst of smoke, and a spluttering of fire the cylinders began
exploding. The hat of Mr. Damon, who was standing back of the
machine, was blown off by the wind created by the propeller.

"Bless my gaiters!" he exclaimed, "I never thought it was as strong
as that!"

"Let go!" cried Tom to Mr. Jackson and Eradicate, who were holding
back the monoplane from gliding over the ground.

"All right," answered the engineer.

An instant later the explosions almost doubled, for Tom turned on
more gasolene. Then, like some live thing, the BUTTERFLY rushed
across the starting ground. Faster and faster it went, until the
young inventor, knowing that he had motion enough, tilted his planes
to catch the wind.

Up he went from earth, like some graceful bird, higher and higher,
and then, in a big spiral, he began ascending until he was five
hundred feet in the air. Up there he traveled back and forth, in
circles, and in figure eights, desiring to test the machine in
various capacities.

Suddenly the engine stopped, and to those below, anxiously watching,
the silence became almost oppressive, for Tom had somewhat
descended, and the explosions had been plainly heard by those
observing him. But now they ceased!

"His engine's stalled!" cried Garret Jackson.

Mr. Swift heard the words, and looked anxiously up at his son.

"Is he in any danger?" gasped Mr. Damon.

No one answered him. Like some great bird, disabled in mid flight,
the monoplane swooped downward. A moment later a hearty shout from
Tom reassured them.

"He shut off the engine on purpose," said Mr. Jackson. "He is
vol-planing back to earth!"

Nearer and nearer came the BUTTERFLY. It would shoot downward, and
then, as Tom tilted the planes, would rise a bit, losing some of the
great momentum. In a series of maneuvers like this, the young
inventor reached the earth, not far from where his father and the
others stood. Down came the BUTTERFLY, the springs of the wheel
frame taking the shock wonderfully well.

"She's all right--regular bird!" cried Tom, in enthusiasm, when the
machine had come to a stop after rolling over the ground, and he had
leaped out. "We'll make a good flight to-morrow, Mr. Damon, if the
weather holds out this way."

"Good!" cried the eccentric man. "I shall be delighted."

They made the start early the next morning, there being hardly a
breath of wind. There was not a trace of nervousness noticeable
about Mr. Damon, as he took his place in the seat beside Tom. The
lad had gone carefully over the entire apparatus, and had seen to it
that, as far as he could tell, it was in perfect running order.

"When will you be back, Tom?" asked his father.

"To-night, perhaps, or to-morrow morning. I don't know just what Mr.
Fenwick wants me to do. But if it is anything that requires a long
stay, I'll come back, and let you know, and then run down to
Philadelphia again. I may need some of my special tools to work
with. I'll be back to-night perhaps."

"Shall I keep supper for you?" asked Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper.

"I don't know," answered Tom, with a laugh. "Perhaps I'll drop down
at Miss Nestor's, and have some apple turnovers," for he had told
them or the incident of hiring the new cook. "Well," he went on to
Mr. Damon, "are you all ready?"

"As ready as I ever shall be. Do you think we'll have to do any
vol-planing, Tom?"

"Hard to say, but it's not dangerous when there's no wind. All
right, Garret. Start her off."

The engineer whirled the big wooden, built-up propeller, and with a
rattle and roar of the motor, effectually drowning any but the
loudest shouts, the BUTTERFLY was ready for her flight. Tom let the
engine warm up a bit before calling to his friends to let go, and
then, when he had thrown the gasolene lever forward, he shouted a
good-by and cried:

"All right! Let go!"

Forward, like a hound from the leash, sprang the little monoplane.
It ran perhaps for five hundred feet, and then, with a tilting of
the wings, to set the air currents against them, it sprang into the
air.

"We're off!" cried Mr. Damon, waving his hand to those on the ground
below.

"Yes, we're off," murmured Tom. "Now for the Quaker City!"

He had mapped out a route for himself the night before, and now,
picking out the land-marks, he laid as straight a course as possible
for Philadelphia.

The sensation of flying along, two thousand feet high, in a machine
almost as frail as a canoe, was not new to Tom. It was, in a degree,
to Mr. Damon, for, though the latter had made frequent trips in the
large airship, this mode of locomotion, as if he was on the back of
some bird, was much different. Still, after the first surprise, he
got used to it.

"Bless my finger ring!" he exclaimed, "I like it!"

"I thought you would," said Tom, in a shout, and he adjusted the oil
feed to send more lubricant into the cylinders.

The earth stretched out below them, like some vari-colored relief
map, but they could not stop to admire any particular spot long, for
they were flying fast, and were beyond a scene almost as quickly as
they had a glimpse of it.

"How long will it take us?" yelled Mr. Damon into Tom's ear.

"I hope to do it in three hours," shouted back the young inventor.

"What! Why it takes the train over five hours."

"Yes, I know, but we're going direct, and it's only about two
hundred and fifty miles. That's only about eighty an hour. We're
doing seventy-five now, and I haven't let her out yet."

"She goes faster than the RED CLOUD," cried Mr. Damon.

Tom nodded. It was hard work to talk in that rush of air. For an
hour they shot along, their speed gradually increasing. Tom called
out the names of the larger places they passed over. He was now
doing better than eighty an hour as the gage showed. The trip was a
glorious one, and the eyes of the young inventor and his friend
sparkled in delight as they rushed forward. Two hours passed.

"Going to make it?" fairly howled Mr. Damon.

Tom nodded again.

"Be there in time for dinner," he announced in a shout.

It lacked forty minutes of the three hours when Tom, pointing with
one hand down below, while with the other he gripped the lever of
the rudder, called:

"North Philadelphia!"

"So soon?" gasped Mr. Damon. "Well, we certainly made speed! Where
are you going to land?"

"I don't know," answered the young inventor, "I'll have to pick out
the best place I see. It's no fun landing in a city. No room to run
along, after you're down."

"What's the matter with Franklin Field?" cried Mr. Damon. "Out where
they play football."

"Good! The very thing!" shouted Tom.

"Mr. Fenwick lives near there," went on Mr. Damon, and Tom nodded
comprehendingly.

They were now over North Philadelphia, and, in a few minutes more
were above the Quaker City itself. They were flying rather low, and
as the people in the streets became aware of their presence there
was intense excitement. Tom steered for the big athletic field, and
soon saw it in the distance.

With a suddenness that was startling the motor ceased its terrific
racket. The monoplane gave a sickening dip, and Tom had to adjust
the wing tips and rudder quickly to prevent it slewing around at a
dangerous angle.

"What's the matter?" cried Mr. Damon, "Did you shut it off on
purpose?"

"No!" shouted Tom, "Something's gone wrong!"

"Gone wrong! Bless my overshoes! Is there any danger?"

"We'll have to vol-plane to earth," answered Tom, and there was a
grim look on his face. He had never executed this feat with a
passenger aboard. He was wondering how the BUTTERFLY would behave.
But he would know very soon, for already the tiny monoplane was
shooting rapidly toward the big field, which was now swarming with a
curious crowd.




CHAPTER VI

THE NEW AIRSHIP


For a brief instant after the stopping of the motor, and the
consequent sudden dropping toward the earth of the monoplane, Tom
glanced at Mr. Damon. The latter's face was rather pale, but he
seemed calm and collected. His lips moved slightly, and Tom, even in
those tense moments, wondered if the odd gentleman was blessing
anything in particular, or everything in general.

Tom threw up the tilting plane, to catch more air beneath it, and
bring the BUTTERFLY in a more parallel position to the earth. This,
in a manner, checked the downward flight, and they glided along
horizontally for a hundred feet or more.

"Is--is there any great danger, Tom?" asked Mr. Damon.

"I think not," answered the young inventor, confidently. "I have
done this same thing before, and from greater heights. The only
thing that bothers me is that there are several cross-currents of
air up here, which make it difficult to manage the planes and wing
tips. But I think we'll make a good landing."

"Bless my overcoat!" exclaimed Mr. Damon "I certainly hope so."

Conversation was more easily carried on now, as the motor was not
spitting fire and throbbing like a battery of Gatling guns. Tom
thought perhaps it might start on the spark, as the propeller was
slowly swinging from the force of air against it. He tried, but
there was no explosion. He had scarcely hoped for it, as he realized
that some part of the mechanism must have broken.

Down they glided, coming nearer and nearer to the earth. The crowd
in the big athletic field grew larger. Shouts of wonder and fear
could be heard, and people could be seen running excitedly about. To
Tom and Mr. Damon they looked like dolls.

Reaching the limit of the parallel glide the monoplane once more
shot down on an incline toward the earth with terrible speed. The
ground seemed to rush up to meet Mr. Damon.

"Look out!" he cried to Tom. "We're going to hit something!"

"Not yet," was the calm answer "I'm going to try a new stunt. Hold
fast!"

"What are you going to do?"

"Some spirals. I think that will let us down easier, but the craft
is likely to tilt a bit, so hold on."

The young inventor shifted the movable planes and rudder, and, a
moment later, the BUTTERFLY swung violently around, like a polo pony
taking a sudden turn after the ball. Mr. Damon slid to one side of
his seat, and made a frantic grab for one of the upright supports.

"I made too short a turn!" cried Tom, easing off the craft, which
righted itself in an instant. "The air currents fooled me."

Under his skillful guidance, the monoplane was soon slowly
approaching the earth in a series of graceful curves. It was under
perfect control, and a smile of relief came on the face of the young
inventor. Seeing it Mr. Damon took courage, and his hands, which had
grasped the uprights with such firmness that his knuckles showed
white with the strain, were now removed. He sat easily in his seat.

"We're all right now," declared Tom. "I'll take a couple of forward
glides now, and we'll land."

He sent the machine straight ahead. It gathered speed in an instant.
Then, with an upward tilt it was slackened, almost as if brakes had
been applied. Once more it shot toward the earth, and once more it
was checked by an up-tilted plane.

Then with a thud which shook up the occupants of the two seats, the
BUTTERFLY came to the ground, and ran along on the three bicycle
wheels. Swiftly it slid over the level ground. A more ideal landing
place would have been hard to find. Scores of willing hands reached
out, and checked the momentum of the little monoplane, and Tom and
Mr. Damon climbed from their seats.

The crowd set up a cheer, and hundreds pressed around the aviators.
Several sought to reach, and touch the machine, for they had
probably never been so close to one before, though airship flights
are getting more and more common.

"Where did you come from?"

"Are you trying for a record?"

"How high did you get?"

"Did you fall, or come down on purpose?"

"Can't you start your motor in mid-air?"

These, and scores of other questions were fairly volleyed at Tom and
Mr. Damon. The young inventor good-naturedly answered them as best
he could.

"We were coming down anyhow," he explained, "but we did not
calculate on vol-planing. The motor was stalled, and I had to glide.
Please keep away from the machine. You might damage it."

The arrival of several policemen, who were attracted by the crowd,
served to keep the curious ones back away from the BUTTERFLY, or the
men, boys and women (for there were a number of the latter in the
throng) might have caused serious trouble.

Tom made a hasty examination of the motor, and, having satisfied
himself that only a minor difficulty had caused it to stop, he
decided to put the monoplane in some safe place, and proceed to Mr.
Fenwick's house.

The lad was just asking one of the officers if the air craft could
not be put in one of the grandstands which surrounded the field,
when a voice on the outskirts of the crowd excitedly exclaimed:

"Let me pass, please. I want to see that airship. I'm building one
myself, and I need all the experience I can get. Let me in, please."

A man pushed his way into the crowd, and wormed his way to where Tom
and Mr. Damon stood. At the sight of him, the eccentric individual
cried out:

"Why bless my pocket-knife! If it isn't Mr. Fenwick!"

"Mr. Fenwick?" gasped Tom.

"Yes. The inventor we came to see!"

At the same moment the newcomer cried out:

"Wakefield Damon!"

"That's who I am," answered Tom's friend, "and let me introduce you
to Mr. Swift, the inventor of more machines than I can count. He and
I were coming to see you, when we had a slight accident, and we
landed here. But that didn't matter, for we intended to land here
anyhow, as I knew it was near your house. Only we had to vol-plane
back to earth, and I can't say that I'd care for that, as a steady
diet. Bless my radiator, but I'm glad we've arrived safely."

"Did you come all the way from your home in that?" asked Mr. Fenwick
of Tom, as he shook hands with him, and nodded at the monoplane.

"Oh, yes. It's not much of a trip."

"Well, I hope my airship will do as well. But something seems to be
wrong with it, and I have hopes that you can help me discover what
it is, I know your father, and I have heard much of your ability.
That is why I requested your aid."

"I'm afraid I've been much overrated," spoke Tom, modestly, "but
I'll do all I can for you. I must now leave my monoplane in a safe
place, however."

"I'll attend to that," Mr. Fenwick hastened to assure him. "Leave it
to me."

By this time a lieutenant of police, in charge of several reserve
officers, had arrived on the scene, for the crowd was now very
large, and, as Mr. Fenwick knew this official, he requested that
Tom's machine be protected from damage. It was arranged that it
could be stored in a large, empty shed, and a policeman would be
left on guard. Then, seeing that it was all right, Tom, Mr. Damon
and Mr. Fenwick started for the latter's house.

"I am very anxious to show you the WHIZZER," said Mr. Fenwick, as
they walked along.

"The WHIZZER?" repeated Tom, wonderingly.

"Yes, that's what I call my electric airship. It hasn't 'whizzed'
any to speak of yet, but I have hopes that it will, now that you are
here to help me. We will take one of these taxicabs, and soon be at
my house. I was out for a stroll, when I saw your monoplane coming
down, and I hastened to Franklin Field to see it."

The three entered an automobile, and were soon being driven to the
inventor's home. A little later he led them out to a big shed which
occupied nearly all of a large lot, in back of Mr. Fenwick's house.

"Does it take up all that room?" asked Tom.

"Oh, yes, the WHIZZER is pretty good size. There she is!" cried Mr.
Fenwick proudly, as he threw open the doors of the shed, and Tom and
Mr. Damon, looking in, saw a large triplane, with a good-sized gas
bag hovering over it, and a strange collection of rudders, wings and
planes sticking out from either side. Amidships was an enclosed car,
or cabin, and a glimpse into it served to disclose to the young
inventor a mass of machinery.

"There she is! That's the WHIZZER!" cried Mr. Fenwick, with pride in
his voice. "What do you think of her, Tom Swift?"

Tom did not immediately answer. He looked dubiously at the electric
airship and shrugged his shoulders. It seemed to him, at first
glance, that, it would never sail.




CHAPTER VII

MAKING SOME CHANGES


"Well, what do you think of it?" asked Mr. Fenwick again, as Tom
walked all about the electric airship, still without speaking.

"It's big, certainly," remarked the lad.

"Bless my shoe horn! I should say it was!" burst out Mr. Damon.
"It's larger than your RED CLOUD, Tom."

"But will it go? That's what I want to know," insisted the inventor.
"Do you think it will fly, Tom? I haven't dared to try it yet,
though a small model which I made floated in the air for some time.
But it wouldn't move, except as the wind blew it."

"It would be hard to say, without a careful examination, whether
this large one will fly or not," answered Tom.

"Then give it a careful examination," suggested Mr. Fenwick. "I'll
pay you well for your time and trouble."

"Oh if I can help a fellow inventor, and assist in making a new
model of airship fly, I'm only too glad to do it without pay,"
retorted Tom, quickly. "I didn't come here for that. Suppose we go
in the cabin, and look at the motor. That's the most important
point, if your airship is to navigate."

There was certainly plenty of machinery in the cabin of the WHIZZER.
Most of it was electrical, for on that power Mr. Fenwick intended to
depend to sail through space. There was a new type of gasolene
engine, small but very powerful, and this served to operate a
dynamo. In turn, the dynamo operated an electrical motor, as Mr.
Fenwick had an idea that better, and more uniform, power could be
obtained in this way, than from a gasolene motor direct. One
advantage which Tom noticed at once, was that the WHIZZER had a
large electric storage battery.

This was intended to operate the electric motor in case of a break
to the main machinery, and it seemed a good idea. There were various
other apparatuses, machines, and appliances, the nature of which Tom
could not readily gather from a mere casual view.

"Well, what's your opinion, now that you have seen the motor?" asked
Mr. Fenwick, anxiously.

"I'd have to see it in operation," said Tom.

"And you shall, right after dinner," declared the inventor. "I'd
like to start it now, and hear what you have to say, but I'm not so
selfish as that. I know you must be hungry after your trip from
Shopton, as they say aeroplaning gives one an appetite."

"I don't know whether it's that or not," answered Tom with a laugh,
"but I am certainly hungry."

"Then we'll postpone the trial until after dinner. It must be ready
by this time, I think," said Mr. Fenwick, as he led the way back to
the house. It was magnificently furnished, for the inventor was a
man of wealth, and only took up aeroplaning as a "fad." An excellent
dinner was served, and then the three returned once more to the shed
where the WHIZZER was kept.

"Shall I start the motor in here?" asked Mr. Fenwick, when he had
summoned several of the machinists whom he employed, to aid himself
and the young inventor.

"It would be better if we could take it outside," suggested Tom,
"yet a crowd is sure to gather, and I don't like to work in a mob of
people."

"Oh, we can easily get around that," said Mr. Fenwick. "I have two
openings to my aeroplane shed. We can take the WHIZZER out of the
rear door, into a field enclosed by a high fence. That is where I
made all my trials, and the crowd couldn't get in, though some boys
did find knot-holes and use them. But I don't mind that. The only
thing that bothers me is that I can't make the WHIZZER go up, and if
it won't go up, it certainly won't sail. That's my difficulty, and I
hope you can remedy it, Tom Swift."

"I'll do the best I can. But let's get the airship outside."

This was soon accomplished, and in the open lot Tom made a thorough
and careful examination of the mechanism. The motor was started, and
the propellers, for there were two, whirled around at rapid speed.

Tom made some tests and calculations, at which he was an expert, and
applied the brake test, to see how much horse power the motor would
deliver.

"I think there is one trouble that we will have to get over," he
finally said to Mr. Fenwick.

"What is that?"

"The motor is not quite powerful enough because of the way in which
you have it geared up. I think by changing some of the cogs, and
getting rid of the off-set shaft, also by increasing the number of
revolutions, and perhaps by using a new style of carburetor, we can
get more speed and power."

"Then we'll do it!" cried Mr. Fenwick, with enthusiasm. "I knew I
hadn't got everything just right. Do you think it will work after
that?"

"Well," remarked Tom, hesitatingly, "I think the arrangement of the
planes will also have to be changed. It will take quite some work,
but perhaps, after a bit, we can get the WHIZZER up in the air."

"Can you begin work at once?" asked the inventor, eagerly.

Tom shook his head.

"I can't stay long enough on this trip," he said. "I promised father
I would be back by to-morrow at the latest, but I will come over
here again, and arrange to stay until I have done all I can. I need
to get some of my special tools, and then, too, you will require
some other supplies, of which I will give you a list. I hope you
don't mind me speaking in this way, Mr. Fenwick, as though I knew
more about it than you do," added Tom, modestly.

"Not a bit of it!" cried the inventor heartily. "I want the benefit
of your advice and experience, and I'll do just as you say. I hope
you can come back soon."

"I'll return the first of the week," promised Tom, "and then we'll
see what can be done. Now I'll go over the whole ship once more, and
see what I need. I also want to test the lifting capacity of your
gas bag."

The rest of the day was a busy one for our hero. With the aid of Mr.
Damon and the owner of the WHIZZER, he went over every point
carefully. Then, as it was too late to attempt the return flight to
Shopton, he telegraphed his father, and he and Mr. Damon remained
over night with Mr. Fenwick.

In the morning, having written out a list of the things that would
be needed, Tom went out to Franklin Field, and repaired his own
monoplane. It was found that one of the electric wires connected
with the motor had broken, thus cutting off the spark. It was soon
repaired, and, in the presence of a large crowd, Tom and Mr. Damon
started on their return flight.

"Do you think you can make the WHIZZER work, Tom?" asked Mr. Damon,
as they were flying high over Philadelphia.

"I'm a little dubious about it," was the reply. "But after I make some
changes I may have a different opinion. The whole affair is too big
and clumsy, that's the trouble; though the electrical part of it is
very good."

Shopton was reached without incident, in about three hours, and
there was no necessity, this time, of vol-planing back to earth.
After a short rest, Tom began getting together a number of special
tools and appliances, which he proposed taking back to Philadelphia
with him.

The young inventor made another trip to Mr. Fenwick's house the
first of the following week. He went by train this time, as he had
to ship his tools, and Mr. Damon did not accompany him. Then, with
the assistance of the inventor of the WHIZZER, and several of his
mechanics, Tom began making the changes on the airship.

"Do you think you can make it fly?" asked Mr. Fenwick, anxiously,
after several days of labor.

"I hope so," replied our hero, and there was more confidence in his
tone than there had been before. As the work progressed, he began to
be more hopeful. "I'll make a trial flight, anyhow, in a few days,"
he added.

"Then I must send word to Mr. Damon," decided Mr. Fenwick. "He wants
to be on hand to see it, and, if possible, go up; so he told me."

"All right," assented Tom. "I only hope it does go up," he
concluded, in a low tone.




CHAPTER VIII

ANDY FOGER'S REVENGE


During the following week, Tom was kept busy over the airship. He
made many important changes, and one of these was to use a new kind
of gas in the balloon bag. He wanted a gas with a greater lifting
power than that of the ordinary illuminating vapor which Mr. Fenwick
had used.

"Well," remarked Tom, as he came from the airship shed one
afternoon, "I think we can give it a try-out, Mr. Fenwick, in a few
days more. I shall have to go back to Shopton to get some articles I
need, and when I come back I will bring Mr. Damon with me, and we
will see what the WHIZZER can do."

"Do you mean we will make a trial flight?"

"Yes."

"For how long a distance?"

"It all depends on how she behaves," answered Tom, with a smile. "If
possible, we'll make a long flight."

"Then I'll tell you what I'm going to do," went on the inventor,
"I'm going to put aboard a stock of provisions, and some other
supplies and stores, in case we are two or three days in the air."

"It might not be a bad plan," agreed Tom, "though I hardly think we
will be gone as long as that."

"Well, being out in the air always makes me hungry," proceeded Mr.
Fenwick, "so I'm going to take plenty of food along."

The time was to come, and that very soon, when this decision of the
inventor of the WHIZZER stood the adventurers in good stead.

Tom returned to Shopton the next day, and sent word to have Mr.
Damon join him in time to go back to the Quaker City two days later.

"But why don't you start right back to Philadelphia to-morrow,"
asked Mr. Swift of his son.

"Because," answered Tom, and that was all the reason he would give,
though had any one seen him reading a certain note a few minutes
before that, which note was awaiting him on his arrival from the
Quaker City, they would not have wondered at his decision.

The note was brief. It merely said:

"Won't you come, and have some apple turnovers? The new cook is a
treasure, and the girls are anxious to meet you."

It was signed: Mary Nestor.

"I think I could enjoy some apple turnovers," remarked Tom, with a
smile.

Having gotten ready the few special appliances he wished to take
back to Philadelphia with him, Tom went, that evening, to call on
Miss Nestor. True to her promise, the girl had a big plate full of
apple turnovers, which she gaily offered our hero on his arrival,
and, on his laughing declination to partake of so many, she ushered
him into a room full of pretty girls, saying:

"They'll help you eat them, Tom. Girls, here is Mr. Swift, who
doesn't mind going up in the air or under the ocean, or even
catching runaway horses," by which last she referred to the time Tom
saved her life, and first made her acquaintance.

As for the young inventor, he gave a gasp, almost as if he had
plunged into a bath of icy water, at the sight of so many pretty
faces staring at him. He said afterward that he would rather have
vol-planed back to earth from a seven-mile height, than again face
such a battery of sparkling eyes.

But our hero soon recovered himself, and entered into the merriment
of the evening, and, before he knew it he was telling Miss Nestor
and her attractive guests something of his exploits.

"But I'm talking altogether too much about myself." he said,
finally. "How is the new cook Miss Nestor; and have you heard from
your father and mother since they sailed on the RESOLUTE for the
West Indies?"

"As to the new cook, she is a jewel of the first water," answered
Miss Nestor. "We all like her, and she is anxious for another ride
in a taxicab, as she calls your auto."

"She shall have it," declared Tom, "for those are the best apple
turnovers I ever ate."

"I'll tell her so," declared Mary. "She'll appreciate it coming from
an inventor of your ability."

"Have you heard from your parents?" asked Tom, anxious to change the
subject.

"Oh, yes. I had a wire to-day. They stopped at St. Augustine to let
me know they were having a glorious time aboard the yacht. Mr.
Hosbrook, the owner, is an ideal host, mamma said. They are
proceeding directly to the West Indies, now. I do hope they will
arrive safely. They say there are bad storms down there at this time
of year."

"Perhaps, if they are shipwrecked, Mr. Swift will go to their rescue
in one of his airships, or a submarine," suggested Mabel Jackson,
one of the several pretty girls.

"Oh, I hope he doesn't have to!" exclaimed Mary. "Don't speak of
shipwrecks! It makes me shudder," and she seemed unduly alarmed.

"Of course they won't have any trouble," asserted Tom, confidently,
more to reassure Miss Nestor, than from any knowledge he possessed;
"but if they do get cast away on a desert island, I'll certainly go
to their rescue," he added.

It was late when Tom started for home that night, for the society of
Miss Nestor and her friends made the time pass quickly. He promised
to call again, and try some more samples of the new cook's culinary
art, as soon as he had gotten Mr. Fenwick's airship in shape for
flying.

As, later that night, the young inventor came in sight of his home,
and the various buildings and shops surrounding it, his first glance
was toward the shed which contained his monoplane, BUTTERFLY. That
little craft was Tom's pet. It had not cost him anything like as
much as had his other inventions, either in time or money, but he
cared more for it than for his big airship, RED CLOUD. This was
principally because the BUTTERFLY was so light and airy, and could
be gotten ready so quickly for a flight across country. It was
capable of long endurance, too, for an extra large supply of
gasolene and oil was carried aboard.

So it was with rather a start of surprise that Tom saw a light in
the structure where the BUTTERFLY was housed.

"I wonder if dad or Mr. Jackson can be out there?" he mused. "Yet, I
don't see why they should be. They wouldn't be going for a flight at
night. Or perhaps Mr. Damon arrived, and is out looking it over."

A moment's reflection, however, told Tom that this last surmise
could not be true, since the eccentric man had telegraphed, saying
he would not arrive until the next day.

"Somebody's out there, however," went on Tom, "and I'm going to see
who it is. I hope it isn't Eradicate monkeying with the monoplane.
He's very curious, and he might get it out of order."

Tom increased his pace, and moved swiftly but softly toward the
shed. If there was an intruder inside he wanted to surprise him.
There were large windows to the place, and they would give a good
view of the interior. As Tom approached, the light within flickered,
and moved to and fro.

Tom reached one of the casements, and peered in. He caught a glimpse
of a moving figure, and he heard a peculiar ripping sound. Then, as
he sprang toward the front door, the light suddenly went out, and
the young inventor could hear some one running from the shop.

"They've seen me, and are trying to get away," thought the lad. "I
must catch them!"

He fairly leaped toward the portal, and, just as he reached it, a
figure sprang out. So close was Tom that the unknown collided with
him, and our hero went over on his back. The other person was tossed
back by the force of the impact, but quickly recovered himself, and
dashed away.

Not before, however, Tom had had a chance to glance at his face,
and, to the chagrin of the young inventor, he recognized, by the dim
light of a crescent moon, the countenance of Andy Foger! If
additional evidence was needed Tom fully recognized the form as that
of the town bully.

"Hold on there, Andy Foger!" shouted the young inventor. "What are
you doing in my shed? What right have you in there? What did you
do?"

Back came the answer through the night:

"I told you I'd get square with you, and I've done it," and then
Andy's footsteps died away, while a mocking laugh floated back to
Tom. What was Andy's revenge?




CHAPTER IX

THE WHIZZER FLIES


For a moment, Tom gazed after the fleeting figure of the cowardly
bully. He was half-minded to give pursuit, and then, realizing that
he could find Andy later if he wanted him, the young inventor
decided his best plan would be to see what damage had been done. For
that damage would follow Andy's secret visit to the shop, Tom was
certain.

Nor was his surmise wrong. Stepping into the building, the lad
switched on the lights, and he could not repress an exclamation of
chagrin as he looked toward his trim little monoplane, the
BUTTERFLY.

Now it was a BUTTERFLY with broken wings, for Andy had slashed the
canvas of the planes in a score of places.

"The scoundrel!" growled Tom. "I'll make him suffer for this! He's
all but ruined my aeroplane."

Tom walked around his pet machine. As he came in front, and saw the
propeller, he gave another exclamation. The fine wooden blades of
several layers, gracefully curved, which had cost him so much in
time and labor to build up, and then fashion to the right shape, had
been hacked, and cut with an axe. The propeller was useless!

"More of Andy's work," murmured Tom. "This is about the worst yet!"

There came over him a feeling of great despondency, which was
succeeded by a justifiable rage. He wanted to take after the bully,
and give him a merciless beating. Then a calmer mood came over Tom.

"After all, what's the use?" he reasoned. "Whipping Andy wouldn't
mend the BUTTERFLY. She's in bad shape, but I can repair her, when I
get time. Luckily, he didn't meddle with the engine. That's all
right." A hasty examination had shown this. "I guess I won't do
anything now," went on Tom. "I'll have my hands full getting Mr.
Fenwick's airship to run. After that I can come back here and fix up
my own. It's a good thing I don't have to depend on her for making
the trip to Philadelphia. Poor BUTTERFLY! you sure are in a bad
way," and Tom felt almost as if he was talking to some living
creature, so wrapped up was he in his trim little monoplane.

After another disheartening look at his air craft, the young
inventor started to leave the shop. He looked at a door, the
fastening of which Andy had broken to gain admittance.

"I should have had the burglar alarm working, and this would never
have happened," reasoned Tom. All the buildings were arranged so
that if any one entered them after a certain hour, an alarm would
ring in the house. But of late, the alarm had not been set, as Tom
and his father were not working on any special inventions that
needed guarding. It was due to this oversight that Andy was able to
get in undetected.

"But it won't happen again," declared Tom, and he at once began
connecting the burglar-apparatus. He went into the house, and told
his father and the engineer what had occurred. They were both
indignant, and the engineer declared that he would sleep with one
eye open all night, ready to respond to the first alarm.

"Oh, there's no danger of Andy coming back right away," said Tom.
"He's too frightened. I wouldn't be surprised if he disappeared for
a time. He'll be thinking that I'm after him."

This proved true, as Andy had left town next morning, and to all
inquiries his mother said he had gone to visit relatives. She was
not aware of her son's meanness, and Tom did not tell her.

Mr. Damon arrived from his home in Waterfield that day, and, with
many "blessings," wanted to know if Tom was ready for the trial of
the electrical airship.

"Yes, we'll leave for Philadelphia to-morrow," was the answer.

"Are we going in the BUTTERFLY? Bless my watch chain, but I like
that little machine!"

"It will be some time before you again have a flight in her," said
Tom, sorrowfully, as he told of Andy's act of vandalism.

"Why, bless my individuality!" cried Mr. Damon, indignantly. "I
never heard of such a thing! Never!"

It did little good to talk of it, however, and Tom wanted to forget
about it. He wished he had time to repair the monoplane before he
left home, but there was much to do to get ready for the trial of
the WHIZZER.

"When will you be back, Tom?" asked Mr. Swift, as his son and Mr.
Damon departed for the Quaker City the following morning.

"Hard to say, dad. If I can make a long flight in the WHIZZER I'll
do so. I may even drop down here and pay you a visit. But if I find
there are many more changes to make in her construction, which is
more than likely, I can't say when I'll return. I'll keep you
posted, however, by writing."

"Can't you arrange to send me some wireless messages?" asked the
older inventor, with a smile.

"I could, if I had thought to rig up the apparatus on Mr. Fenwick's
airship," was the reply. "I'll hardly have time to do it now,
though."

"Send wireless messages from an aeroplane?" gasped Mr. Damon. "Bless
my gizzard! I never heard of such a thing!"

"Oh, it can be done," Tom assured him. And this was a fact. Tom had
installed a wireless apparatus on his RED CLOUD recently, and it is
well known that several of the modern biplanes can send wireless
messages. The crossing and bracing wires of the frame are used for
sending wires, and in place of ground conductors there are trailers
which hang below the aeroplane. The current is derived directly from
the engine, and the remaining things needed are a small step-up
transformer, a key and a few other small parts. Tom had gone a step
farther than this, and had also arranged to receive wireless
messages, though few modern aeroplanes are thus equipped as yet.

But, of course, there was no time now to install a wireless
apparatus on Mr. Fenwick's craft. Tom thought he would be lucky if
he got the WHIZZER to make even a short flight.

"Well, let me hear from you when you can," requested Mr. Swift, and
Tom promised. It was some time after that, and many strange things
happened before Tom Swift again communicated with his father, at any
length.

The young inventor had bidden farewell to Miss Nestor the night
previous. She stated that she had a message that day from her
parents aboard the RESOLUTE, which spoke a passing steamer. Mr. and
Mrs. Nestor, and the other guests of Mr. Hosbrook were well, and
anticipated a fine time on reaching the West Indies.

Tom now said good-by to his father, the housekeeper and Mr. Jackson,
not forgetting, of course, Eradicate Sampson.

"Don't let Andy Foger come sneaking around here, Rad," cautioned the
young inventor.

"'Deed an' I won't!" exclaimed the colored man. "Ef he do, I'll hab
Boomerang kick him t' pieces, an' den I'll whitewash him so his own
folks won't know him! Oh, don't you worry, Massa Tom. Dat Andy won't
do no funny business when I'm around!"

Tom laughed, and started for the station with Mr. Damon. They
arrived in Philadelphia that afternoon, the trip being very slow, as
compared with the one made by the monoplane. They found Mr. Fenwick
anxiously awaiting them, and Tom at once started work on the
airship.

He kept at it until late that night, and resumed early the next
morning. Many more changes and adjustments were made, and that
afternoon, the young inventor said:

"I think we'll give it a try-out, Mr. Fenwick."

"Do you mean make a flight?"

"Yes, if she'll take it; but only a short one. I want to get her up
in the air, and see how she behaves."

"Well, if you find out, after you're up, that she does well, you may
want to take a long flight," suggested Mr. Fenwick. "If you do, why
I have everything aboard necessary for a long voyage. The WHIZZER is
well stocked with provisions."

An hour later, the big electric machine was wheeled out into the
yard, for, in spite of her size, four men could easily move the
craft about, so well was she balanced. Aside from a few personal
friends of the inventor, himself, his machinists, Tom and Mr. Damon,
no one was present at the try-out.

Tom, Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick climbed into the car which was
suspended below the gas bag, and between the wing-like planes on
either side. The young inventor had decided to make the WHIZZER rise
by scudding her across the ground on the bicycle wheels, with which
she was equipped, and then by using the tilting planes to endeavor
to lift her off the earth. He wanted to see if she would go up that
way, without the use of the gas bag.

All was in readiness. The motor was started and the machinery began
to hum and throb. The propellers gained speed with every revolution.
The airship had been made fast by a rope, to which was attached a
strong spring balance, as it was desired to see how much pull the
engine would give.

"Eight hundred pounds," announced one of the machinists.

"A thousand would be better, but we'll try it," murmured Tom. "Cast
off!"

The rope was loosened, and, increasing the speed of the engine, Tom
signalled to the men to give a little momentum to the craft. She
began running over the smooth ground. There was a cheer from the few
spectators. Certainly the WHIZZER made good time on the earth.

Tom was anxiously watching the gages and other instruments. He
wanted a little more speed, but could not seem to get it. He ran the
motor to the utmost, and then, seeing the necessity of making an
attempt to get up into the air, before the end of the speeding
ground was reached, he pulled the elevating plane lever.

The front of the WHIZZER rose, and then settled down. Tom quickly
shut off the power, and jammed on the brake, an arrangement of
spikes that dug into the earth, for the high board fence loomed up
before him.

"What's the matter?" cried Mr. Fenwick, anxiously.

"Couldn't get up speed enough," answered the young inventor. "We
must have more momentum to make her rise."

"Can it be gotten?"

"I think so. I'll gear the motor higher."

It took an hour to do this. Once more the scale test was applied. It
registered a pull of fifteen hundred pounds now.

"We'll go up," said Tom, grimly.

Once more the motors spit out fire, and the propellers whirled so
that they looked like mere circles of light. Once more the WHIZZER
shot over the ground, but this time, as she neared the fence, she
rose up like a bird, cleared it like a trick horse, and soared off
into the air!

The WHIZZER was flying!




CHAPTER X

OVER THE OCEAN


"Hurrah!" cried Mr. Fenwick in delight. "My machine is really flying
at last!"

"Yes," answered Tom, as he adjusted various levers and gears, "she
is going. It's not as high as I'd like, but it is doing very well,
considering the weight of the craft, and the fact that we have not
used the gas bag. I'm going to let that fill now, and we'll go up.
Don't you want to steer, Mr. Fenwick?"

"No, you manage it, Tom, until it's in good running shape. I don't
want to 'hoodoo' it. I worked as hard as I could, and never got more
than two feet off the ground. Now I'm really sailing. It's great!"

He was very enthusiastic, and Tom himself was not a little pleased
at his own success, for certainly the airship had looked to be a
very dubious proposition at first.

"Bless my gaiters! But we are doing pretty well," remarked Mr.
Damon, looking down on the field where Mr. Fenwick's friends and the
machinists were gathered, cheering and waving their hands.

"We'll do better," declared Tom.

He had already set the gas machine in operation, and was now looking
over the electric apparatus, to see that it was working well. It
needed some adjustments, which he made.

All this while the WHIZZER was moving about in a big circle, for the
rudder had been automatically set to so swing the craft. It was
about two hundred feet high, but soon after the gas began to enter
the bag it rose until it was nearly five thousand feet high. This
satisfied Tom that the airship could do better than he expected, and
he decided to return nearer earth.

In going down, he put the craft through a number of evolutions
designed to test her ability to answer the rudders promptly. The lad
saw opportunity for making a number of changes, and suggested them
to Mr. Fenwick.

"Are you going any farther?" asked the owner of the WHIZZER, as he
saw that his craft was slowly settling.

"No, I think we've done enough for the first day," said Tom, "But
I'd like you to handle her now, Mr. Fenwick. You can make the
landing, while I watch the motor and other machines."

"Yes. I guess I can make a landing all right," assented the
inventor. "I'm better at coming down than going up."

He did make a good descent, and received the congratulation of his
friends as he stepped from the airship. Tom was also given much
praise for his success in making the craft go at all, for Mr.
Fenwick and his acquaintances had about given up hope that she ever
would rise.

"Well, what do you think of her?" Mr. Fenwick wanted to know of the
young inventor, who replied that, as soon as some further changes
had been made, they would attempt a long flight.

This promise was kept two days later. They were busy days for Tom,
Mr. Fenwick and the latter's assistants. Tom sent a short note to
his father telling of the proposed long flight, and intimated that
he might make a call in Shopton if all went well. He also sent a
wire to Miss Nestor, hinting that she might have some apple
turnovers ready for him.

But Tom never called for that particular pastry, though it was
gotten ready for him when the girl received his message.

All was in readiness for the long flight, and a preliminary test had
demonstrated that the WHIZZER had been wonderfully improved by the
changes Tom made. The young inventor looked over the supply of food
Mr. Fenwick had placed aboard, glanced at the other stores, and
asked:

"How long do you expect to be gone, Mr. Fenwick?"

"Why, don't you think we can stay out a week?"

"That's quite a while," responded Tom. "We may be glad to return in
two days, or less. But I think we're all ready to start. Are any of
your friends going?"

"I've tried to pursuade some of them to accompany me, but they are a
bit timid," said the inventor. "I guess we three will make up the
party this time, though if our trip is a successful one I'll be
overwhelmed with requests for rides, I suppose."

As before, a little crowd gathered to see the start. The day was
warm, but there was a slight haziness which Tom did not like. He
hoped, though, that it would pass over before they had gone far.

"Do you wish to head for any particular spot, Mr. Fenwick?" asked
Tom, as they were entering the cabin.

"Yes, I would like to go down and circle Cape May, New Jersey, if we
could. I have a friend who has a summer cottage there, and he was
always laughing at my airship. I'd just like to drop down in front
of his place now, and pay him a call."

"We'll try it," assented Tom, with a smile.

An auspicious start was made, the WHIZZER taking the air after a
short flight across the ground, and then, with the lifting gas
aiding in pulling the craft upward, the airship started to sail high
over the city of Philadelphia.

So swiftly did it rise that the cheers of the little crowd of Mr.
Fenwick's friends were scarcely heard. Up and up it went, and then a
little later, to the astonishment of the crowds in the streets, Tom
put the airship twice in a circle around the statue of William Penn,
on the top of the City Hall.

"Now you steer," the lad invited Mr. Fenwick. "Take her straight
across the Delaware River, and over Camden, New Jersey, and then
head south, for Cape May. We ought to make it in an hour, for we are
getting up good speed."

Leaving the owner in charge of his craft, to that gentleman's no
small delight, Tom and Mr. Damon began an inspection of the
electrical and other machinery. There was much that needed
attention, but Tom soon had the automatic apparatus in working
order, and then less attention need be given to it.

Several times the young investor looked out of the windows with
which the cabin was fitted. Mr. Damon noticed this.

"Bless my shoe laces, Tom," he said. "What's the matter?"

"I don't like the looks of the weather," was the answer. "I think
we're in for a storm."

"Then let's put back."

"No, it would be too bad to disappoint Mr. Fenwick, now that we have
made such a good start. He wants to make a long flight, and I can't
blame him," spoke Tom, in a low voice.

"But if there's danger--"

"Oh, well, we can soon be at Cape May, and start back. The wind is
freshening rather suddenly, though," and Tom looked at the
anemometer, which showed a speed of twenty miles an hour. However,
it was in their favor, aiding them to make faster time.

The speed of the WHIZZER was now about forty miles an hour, not fast
for an air craft, but sufficiently speedy in trying out a new
machine. Tom looked at the barograph, and noted that they had
attained an altitude of seven thousand five hundred feet.

"That's better than millionaire Daxtel's distance of seven thousand
one hundred and five feet," remarked the lad, with a smile, "and it
breaks Jackson's climb of seven thousand three hundred and three
feet, which is pretty good for your machine, Mr. Fenwick."

"Do you really think so?" asked the pleased inventor.

"Yes. And we'll do better than that in time, but it's best to go
slow at first, until we see how she is standing the strain. This is
high and fast enough for the present."

They kept on, and as Tom saw that the machinery was working well, he
let it out a little, The WHIZZER at once leaped forward, and, a
little later they came within sight of Cape May, the Jersey coast
resort.

"Now to drop down and visit my friend," said Mr. Fenwick, with a
smile. "Won't he be surprised!"

"I don't think we'd better do it," said Tom.

"Why not?"

"Well, the wind is getting stronger every minute and it will be
against us on the way back. If we descend, and try to make another
ascension we may fail. We're up in the air now, and it may be easy
to turn around and go back. Then, again, it may not, but it
certainly will be easier to shift around up here than down on the
ground. So I'd rather not descend--that is, not entirely to the
ground."

"Well, just as you say, though I wanted my friend to know I could
build a successful airship."

"Oh, we can get around that. I'll take her down as low as is safe,
and fly over his house, if you'll point it out, and you can drop him
a message in one of the pasteboard tubes we carry for that purpose."

"That's a good idea," assented Mr. Fenwick. "I'll do it."

Tom sent the WHIZZER down until the hotels and cottages could be
made out quite plainly. After looking with a pair of opera glasses,
Mr. Fenwick picked out the residence of his friend, and Tom prepared
to circle about the roof.

By this time the presence of the airship had become known to
hundreds, and crowds were eagerly watching it.

"There he is! There's my friend who didn't believe I would ever
succeed!" exclaimed Mr. Fenwick, pointing to a man who stood in the
street in front of a large, white house. "I'll drop him a message!"

One was in readiness in a weighted pasteboard cylinder, and soon it
was falling downward. The airship was moving slowly, as it was
beating against the wind.

Leaning out of the cabin window, Mr. Fenwick shouted to his friend:

"Hey, Will! I thought you said my airship would never go! I'll come
and give you a ride, some day!"

Whether the gentleman understood what Mr. Fenwick shouted at him is
doubtful, but he saw the inventor waving his hand, and he saw the
falling cylinder, and a look of astonishment spread over his face,
as he ran to pick up the message.

"We're going up now, and will try to head for home," said Tom, a
moment later, as he shifted the rudder.

"Bless my storage battery!" cried Mr. Damon. "But we have had a fine
trip."

"A much better one than we'll have going back," observed Tom, in a
low voice.

"Why; what's the matter?" asked the eccentric man.

"The wind has increased to a gale, and will be dead against us,"
answered Tom.

Mr. Fenwick was busy writing another message to drop, and he paid
little attention to the young inventor. Tom sent the craft well up
into the air, and then tried to turn it about, and head back for
Philadelphia. No sooner had he done so than the airship was met by
the full force of the wind, which was now almost a hurricane. It had
steadily increased, but, as long as they were moving with it, they
did not notice it so much. Once they attempted to stem its fury they
found themselves almost helpless.

Tom quickly realized this, and, giving up his intention of beating
up against the wind, he turned the craft around, and let it fly
before the gale, the propellers aiding to get up a speed of seventy
miles an hour.

Mr. Fenwick, who had dropped the last of his messages, came from his
small private cabin, to where Mr. Damon and Tom were in a low-voiced
conversation near the engines. The owner of the WHIZZER, happened to
look down through a plate-glass window in the floor of car. What he
saw caused him to give a gasp of astonishment.

"Why--why!" he exclaimed. "We--we're over the ocean."

"Yes," answered Tom, quietly, as he gazed down on the tumbling
billows below them. They had quickly passed over Cape May, across
the sandy beach, and were now well out over the Atlantic.

"Why--why are we out here?" asked Mr. Fenwick. "Isn't it dangerous--in
an airship that hasn't been thoroughly tried yet?"

"Dangerous? Yes, somewhat," replied Tom, slowly. "But we can't help
ourselves, Mr. Fenwick. We can't turn around and go back in this
gale, and we can't descend."

"Then what's to be done?"

"Nothing, except to keep on until the gale blows itself out."

"And how long will that be?"

"I don't know--a week, maybe."

"Bless my coffee pot, I'm glad we've got plenty on board to eat!"
exclaimed Mr. Damon.




CHAPTER XI

A NIGHT OF TERROR


After the first shock of Tom's announcement, the two men, who were
traveling with him in the airship, showed no signs of fear. Yet it
was alarming to know that one was speeding over the mighty ocean,
before a terrific gale, with nothing more substantial under one that
a comparatively frail airship.

Still Mr. Damon knew Tom of old, and had confidence in his ability,
and, while Mr. Fenwick was not so well acquainted with our hero, he
had heard much about him, and put faith in his skill to carry them
out of their present difficulty.

"Are you sure you can't turn around and go back?" asked Mr. Fenwick.
His knowledge of air-currents was rather limited.

"It is out of the question," replied Tom, simply. "We would surely
rip this craft to pieces if we attempted to buffet this storm."

"Is it so bad, then?" asked Mr. Damon, forgetting to bless anything
in the tense excitement of the moment.

"It might be worse," was the reply of the young inventor. "The wind
is blowing about eighty miles an hour at times, and to try to turn
now would mean that we would tear the planes loose from the ship.
True, we could still keep up by means of the gas bag, but even that
might be injured. Going as we are, in the same direction as that in
which the wind is blowing, we do not feel the full effect of it."

"But, perhaps, if we went lower down, or higher up, we could get in
a different current of air," suggested Mr. Fenwick, who had made
some study of aeronautics.

"I'll try," assented Tom, simply. He shifted the elevating rudder,
and the WHIZZER began to go up, slowly, for there was great lateral
pressure on her large surface. But Tom knew his business, and urged
the craft steadily. The powerful electric engines, which were the
invention of Mr. Fenwick, stood them in good stead, and the
barograph soon showed that they were steadily mounting.

"Is the wind pressure any less?" inquired Mr. Damon, anxiously.

"On the contrary, it seems to be increasing," replied Tom, with a
glance at the anemometer. "It's nearly ninety miles an hour now."

"Then, aided by the propellers, we must be making over a hundred
miles an hour." said the inventor.

"We are,--a hundred and thirty," assented Tom.

"We'll be blown across the ocean at this rate," exclaimed Mr. Damon.
"Bless my soul! I didn't count on that."

"Perhaps we had better go down," suggested Mr. Fenwick. "I don't
believe we can get above the gale."

"I'm afraid not," came from Tom. "It may be a bit better down
below."

Accordingly, the rudder was changed, and the WHIZZER pointed her
nose downward. None of the lifting gas was let out, as it was
desired to save that for emergencies.

Down, down, down, went the great airship, until the adventurers
within, by gazing through the plate glass window in the floor of the
cabin, could see the heaving, white-capped billows, tossing and
tumbling below them.

"Look out, or we'll be into them!" shouted Mr. Damon.

"I guess we may as well go back to the level where we were,"
declared Tom. "The wind, both above and below that particular strata
is stronger, and we will be safer up above. Our only chance is to
scud before it, until it has blown itself out. And I hope it will be
soon."

"Why?" asked Mr. Damon, in a low voice.

"Because we may be blown so far that we can not get back while our
power holds out, and then--" Tom did not finish, but Mr. Damon knew
what he meant--death in the tossing ocean, far from land, when the
WHIZZER, unable to float in the air any longer, should drop into the
storm-enraged Atlantic.

They were again on a level, where the gale blew less furiously than
either above or below, but this was not much relief. It seemed as if
the airship would go to pieces, so much was it swayed and tossed
about. But Mr. Fenwick, if he had done nothing else, had made a
staunch craft, which stood the travelers in good stead.

All the rest of that day they swept on, at about the same speed.
There was nothing for them to do, save watch the machinery,
occasionally replenishing the oil tanks, or making minor
adjustments.

"Well," finally remarked Mr. Damon, when the afternoon was waning
away, "if there's nothing else to do, suppose we eat. Bless my
appetite, but I'm hungry! and I believe you said, Mr. Fenwick, that
you had plenty of food aboard."

"So we have, but the excitement of being blown out to sea on our
first real trip, made me forget all about it. I'll get dinner at
once, if you can put up with an amateur's cooking."

"And I'll help," offered Mr. Damon. "Tom can attend to the airship,
and we'll serve the meals. It will take our minds off our troubles."

There was a well equipped kitchen aboard the WHIZZER and soon savory
odors were coming from it. In spite of the terror of their
situation, and it was not to be denied that they were in peril, they
all made a good meal, though it was difficult to drink coffee and
other liquids, owing to the sudden lurches which the airship gave
from time to time as the gale tossed her to and fro.

Night came, and, as the blackness settled down, the gale seemed to
increase in fury. It howled through the slender wire rigging of the
WHIZZER, and sent the craft careening from side to side, and
sometimes thrust her down into a cavern of the air, only to lift her
high again, almost like a ship on the heaving ocean below them.

As darkness settled in blacker and blacker, Tom had a glimpse below
him, of tossing lights on the water.

"We just passed over some vessel," he announced. "I hope they are in
no worse plight than we are." Then, there suddenly came to him a
thought of the parents of Mary Nestor, who were somewhere on the
ocean, in the yacht RESOLUTE bound for the West Indies.

"I wonder if they're out in this storm, too?" mused Tom. "If they
are, unless the vessel is a staunch one, they may be in danger."

The thought of the parents of the girl he cared so much for being in
peril, was not reassuring to Tom, and he began to busy himself about
the machinery of the airship, to take his mind from the presentiment
that something might happen to the RESOLUTE.

"We'll have our own troubles before morning," the lad mused, "if
this wind doesn't die down."

There was no indication that this was going to be the case, for the
gale increased rather than diminished. Tom looked at their speed
gage. They were making a good ninety miles an hour, for it had been
decided that it was best to keep the engine and propellers going, as
they steadied the ship.

"Ninety miles an hour," murmured Tom. "And we've been going at that
rate for ten hours now. That's nearly a thousand miles. We are quite
a distance out to sea."

He looked at a compass, and noted that, instead of being headed
directly across the Atlantic they were bearing in a southerly
direction.

"At this rate, we won't come far from getting to the West Indies
ourselves," reasoned the young inventor. "But I think the gale will
die away before morning."

The storm did not, however. More fiercely it blew through the hours
of darkness. It was a night of terror, for they dared not go to
sleep, not knowing at what moment the ship might turn turtle, or
even rend apart, and plunge with them into the depths of the sea.

So they sat up, occasionally attending to the machinery, and noting
the various gages. Mr. Damon made hot coffee, which they drank from
time to time, and it served to refresh them.

There came a sudden burst of fury from the storm, and the airship
rocked as if she was going over.

"Bless my heart!" cried Mr. Damon, springing up. "That was a close
call!"

Tom said nothing. Mr. Fenwick looked pale and alarmed.

The hours passed. They were swept ever onward, at about the same
speed, sometimes being whirled downward, and again tossed upward at
the will of the wind. The airship was well-nigh helpless, and Tom,
as he realized their position, could not repress a fear in his heart
as he thought of the parents of the girl he loved being tossed about
on the swirling ocean, in a frail pleasure yacht.




CHAPTER XII

A DOWNWARD GLIDE


They sat in the cabin of the airship, staring helplessly at each
other. Occasionally Tom rose to attend to one of the machines, or
Mr. Fenwick did the same. Occasionally, Mr. Damon uttered a remark.
Then there was silence, broken only by the howl of the gale.

It seemed impossible for the WHIZZER to travel any faster, yet when
Tom glanced at the speed gage he noted, with a feeling of surprise,
akin to horror, that they were making close to one hundred and fifty
miles an hour. Only an aeroplane could have done it, and then only
when urged on by a terrific wind which added to the speed produced
by the propellers.

The whole craft swayed and trembled, partly from the vibration of
the electrical machinery, and partly from the awful wind. Mr.
Fenwick came close to Tom, and exclaimed:

"Do you think it would be any use to try once more to go above or
below the path of the storm?"

Tom's first impulse was to say that it would be useless, but he
recollected that the craft belonged to Fenwick, and surely that
gentleman had a right to make a suggestion. The young inventor
nodded.

"We'll try to go up," he said. "If that doesn't work, I'll see if I
can force her down. It will be hard work, though. The wind is too
stiff."

Tom shifted the levers and rudders. His eyes were on the barograph--that
delicate instrument, the trembling hand of which registered
their height. Tom had tilted the deflection rudder to send them up,
but as he watched the needle he saw it stationary. They were not
ascending, though the great airship was straining to mount to an
upper current where there might be calm.

It was useless, however, and Tom, seeing the futility of it, shifted
the rudder to send them downward. This was more easily accomplished,
but it was a change for the worse, since, the nearer to the ocean
they went, the fiercer blew the wind.

"Back! Go back up higher!" cried Mr. Damon,

"We can't!" yelled Tom. "We've got to stay here now!"

"Oh, but this is awful!" exclaimed Mr. Fenwick. "We can never stand
this!"

The airship swaged more than ever, and the occupants were tossed
about in the cabin, from side to side. Indeed, it did seem that
human beings never could come alive out of that fearful ordeal.

As Tom looked from one of the windows of the cabin, he noted a pale,
grayish sort of light outside. At first he could not understand what
it was, then, as he observed the sickly gleams of the incandescent
electric lamps, he knew that the hour of dawn was at hand.

"See!" he exclaimed to his companions, pointing to the window.
"Morning is coming."

"Morning!" gasped Mr. Damon. "Is the night over? Now, perhaps we
shall get rid of the storm."

"I'm afraid not," answered Tom, as he noted the anemometer and felt
the shudderings of the WHIZZER as she careened on through the gale.
"It hasn't blown out yet!"

The pale light increased. The electrics seemed to dim and fade. Tom
looked to the engines. Some of the apparatus was in need of oil, and
he supplied it. When he came back to the main cabin, where stood Mr.
Damon and Mr. Fenwick, it was much lighter outside.

"Less than a day since we left Philadelphia," murmured the owner of
the WHIZZER, as he glanced at a distance indicator, "yet we have
come nearly sixteen hundred miles. We certainly did travel top
speed. I wonder where we are?"

"Still over the ocean," replied Mr. Damon, as he looked down at the
heaving billows rolling amid crests of foam far below them. "Though
what part of it would be hard to say. We'll have to reckon out our
position when it gets calmer."

Tom came from the engine room. His face wore a troubled look, and he
said, addressing the older inventor:

"Mr. Fenwick, I wish you'd come and look at the gas generating
apparatus. It doesn't seem to be working properly."

"Anything wrong?" asked Mr. Damon, suspiciously.

"I hope not," replied Tom, with all the confidence he could muster.
"It may need adjusting. I am not so familiar with it as I am with
the one on the RED CLOUD. The gas seems to be escaping from the bag,
and we may have to descend, for some distance."

"But the aeroplanes will keep us up," said Mr. Daman.

"Yes--they will," and Tom hesitated. "That is, unless something
happens to them. They are rather frail to stand alone the brunt of
the gale, and I wish--"

Tom did not complete the sentence. Instead, he paused suddenly and
seemed to be intently listening.

From without there came a rending, tearing, crashing sound. The
airship quivered from end to end, and seemed to make a sudden dive
downward. Then it appeared to recover, and once more glided forward.

Tom, followed by Mr. Fenwick, made a rush for the compartment where
the machine was installed. They had no sooner reached it than there
sounded an explosion, and the airship recoiled as if it had hit a
stone wall.

"Bless my shaving brush! What's that?" cried Mr. Damon. "Has
anything happened?"

"I'm rather afraid there has," answered Tom, solemnly. "It sounded
as though the gas bag went up. And I'm worried over the strength of
the planes. We must make an investigation!"

"We're falling!" almost screamed Mr. Fenwick, as he glanced at the
barograph, the delicate needle of which was swinging to and fro,
registering different altitudes.

"Bless my feather bed! So we are!" shouted Mr. Damon. "Let's jump,
and avoid being caught under the airship!"

He darted for a large window, opening from the main cabin, and was
endeavoring to raise it when Tom caught his hand.

"What are you trying to do," asked the lad, hoarsely.

"Save my life! I want to get out of this as soon as I can. I'm going
to jump!"

"Don't think of it! You'd be instantly killed. We're too high for a
jump, even into the ocean."

"The ocean! Oh, is that still below us? Is there any chance of being
saved? What can be done?" Mr. Damon hesitated.

"We must first find out how badly we are damaged," said Tom,
quietly. "We must keep our heads, and be calm, no matter what
happens. I need your help, Mr. Damon."

This served to recall the rather excited man to his senses. He came
back to the centre of the cabin, which was no easy task, for the
floor of it was tilted at first one angle, and then another. He
stood at Tom's side.

"What can I do to help you?" he asked. Mr. Fenwick was darting here
and there, examining the different machines. None of them seemed to
be damaged.

"If you will look and see what has happened to our main wing planes,
I will see how much gas we have left in the bag," suggested Tom.
"Then we can decide what is best to be done. We are still quite
high, and it will take some time to complete our fall, as, even if
everything is gone, the material of the bag will act as a sort of
parachute."

Mr. Damon darted to a window in the rear of the cabin, where he
could obtain a glimpse of the main wing planes. He gave a cry of
terror and astonishment.

"Two of the planes are gone!" he reported. "They are torn and are
hanging loose."

"I feared as much," retorted Tom, quietly, "The gale was too much
for them."

"What of the lifting gas?" asked Mr. Fenwick, quickly.

"It has nearly all flowed out of the retaining bag."

"Then we must make more at once. I will start the generating
machine."

He darted toward it.

"It will be useless," spoke Tom, quietly.

"Why?"

"Because there is no bag left to hold it. The silk and rubber
envelope has been torn to pieces by the gale. The wind is even
stronger than it was last night."

"Then what's to be done?" demanded Mr. Damon, with a return of his
alarmed and nervous manner. "Bless my fingernails! What's to be
done?"

For an instant Tom did not answer. It was constantly getting
lighter, though there was no sun, for it was obscured by scudding
clouds. The young inventor looked critically at the various gages
and indicators.

"Is--is there any chance for us?" asked Mr. Fenwick, quietly.

"I think so," answered Tom, with a hopeful smile. "We have about two
thousand feet to descend, for we have fallen nearly that distance
since the accident."

"Two thousand feet to fall!" gasped Mr. Damon. "We can never do it
and live!"

"I think so," spoke Tom.

"Bless my gizzard! How?" fairly exploded Mr. Damon.

"By vol-planing down!"

"But, even if we do, we will fall into the ocean!" cried Mr.
Fenwick. "We will be drowned!"

"No," and Tom spoke more quietly than before. "We are over a large
island." he went on, "and I propose to let the disabled airship
vol-plane down to it. That is our only chance."

"Over an island!" cried Mr. Damon. He looked down through the floor
observation window. Tom had spoken truly. At that moment they were
over a large island, which had suddenly loomed up in the wild and
desolate waste of the ocean. They had reached its vicinity just in
time.

Tom stepped to the steering and rudder levers, and took charge. He
was going to attempt a most difficult feat--that of guiding a
disabled airship back to earth in the midst of a hurricane, and
landing her on an unknown island. Could he do it?

There was but one answer. He must try. It was the only chance of
saving their lives, and a slim one at best.

Down shot the damaged WHIZZER like some giant bird with broken
wings, but Tom Swift was in charge, and it seemed as if the craft
knew it, as she began that earthward glide.




CHAPTER XIII

ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND


Mingled feelings possessed the three adventurers within the airship.
Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick had crowded to the window, as Tom spoke,
to get a glimpse of the unknown island toward which they were
shooting. They could see it more plainly now, from the forward
casement, as well as from the one in the bottom of the craft. A
long, narrow, rugged piece of land it was, in the midst of the
heaving ocean, for the storm still raged and lashed the waves to
foam.

"Can you make it?" asked Mr. Damon, in a low voice.

"I think so," answered Tom, more cheerfully.

"Shall I shut down the motor?" inquired the older inventor.

"Yes, you might as well. We don't need the propellers now, and I may
be better able to make the glide without them."

The buzzing and purring electrical apparatus was shut down. Silence
reigned in the airship, but the wind still howled outside. As Tom
had hoped, the ship became a little more steady with the stopping of
the big curved blades, though had the craft been undamaged they
would have served to keep her on an even keel.

With skillful hand he so tilted the elevating planes that, after a
swift downward glide, the head of the WHIZZER would be thrown up, so
to speak, and she would sail along in a plane parallel to the
island. This had the effect of checking her momentum, just as the
aviator checks the downward rush of his monoplane or biplane when he
is making a landing.

Tom repeated this maneuver several times, until a glance at his
barograph showed that they had but a scant sixty feet to go. There
was time but for one more upward throwing of the WHIZZER's nose, and
Tom held to that position as long as possible. They could now make
out the topography of the island plainly, for it was much lighter.
Tom saw a stretch of sandy beach, and steered for that.

Downward shot the airship, inert and lifeless. It was not like
gliding his little BUTTERFLY to earth after a flight, but Tom hoped
he could make it. They were now within ten feet of the earth,
skimming forward. Tom tried another upward tilt, but the forward
planes would not respond. They could get no grip on the air.

With a crash that could have been heard some distance the WHIZZER
settled to the sand. It ran along a slight distance, and then, as
the bicycle wheels collapsed under the pressure, the airship seemed
to go together in a shapeless mass.

At the first impact with the earth, Tom had leaped away from the
steering wheel and levers, for he did not want to be crushed against
them. Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick, in pursuance of a plan adopted when
they found that they were falling, had piled a lot of seat cushions
around them. They had also provided some as buffers for Tom, and our
hero, at the instant of the crash, had thrown himself behind and
upon them.

It seemed as if the whole ship went to pieces. The top of the main
cabin crashed down, as the side supports gave way, but, fortunately,
there were strong main braces, and the roof did not fall completely
upon our friends.

The whole bottom of the craft was forced upward and had it not been
for the protecting cushions, there might have been serious injuries
for all concerned. As it was they were badly bruised and shaken up.

After the first crash, and succeeding it an instant later, there
came a second smash, followed by a slight explosion, and a shower of
sparks could be seen in the engine room.

"That's the electrical apparatus smashing through the floor!" called
Tom. "Come, let's get out of here before the gasolene sets anything
on fire. Are you all right, Mr. Damon, and you, Mr. Fenwick?"

"Yes, I guess so," answered the inventor. "Oh, what a terrible
crash! My airship is ruined!"

"You may be glad we are alive," said Mr. Damon. "Bless my top knot,
I feel--"

He did not finish the sentence. At that moment a piece of wood,
broken from the ceiling, where it had hung by a strip of canvas came
crashing down, and hit Mr. Damon on the head.

The eccentric man toppled over on his pile of cushions, from which
he was arising when he was struck.

"Oh, is he killed?" gasped Mr. Fenwick.

"I hope not!" cried Tom. "We must get him out of here, at all
events. There may be a fire."

They both sprang to Mr. Damon's aid, and succeeded in lifting him
out. There was no difficulty in emerging from the airship as there
were big, broken gaps, on all sides of what was left of the cabin.
Once in the outer air Mr. Damon revived, and opened his eyes.

"Much hurt?" asked Tom, feeling of his friend's head.

"No--no, I--I guess not," was the slow answer. "I was stunned for a
moment. I'm all right now. Nothing broken, I guess," and his hand
went to his head.

"No, nothing broken," added Tom, cheerfully, "but you've got a lump
there as big as an ostrich egg. Can you walk?"

"Oh, I'm all right. Bless my stars, what a wreck!"

Mr. Damon looked at the remains of the airship. It certainly was a
wreck! The bent and twisted planes were wrapped about the afterpart,
the gas bag was but a shred, the frame was splintered and twisted,
and the under part, where the starting wheels were placed, resembled
a lot of broken bicycles. The cabin looked like a shack that had
sustained an explosion of dynamite.

"It's a wonder we came out alive," said Mr. Fenwick, in a low voice.

"Indeed it is," agreed Tom, as he came back with a tin can full of
sea water, with which to bathe Mr. Damon's head. The lad had picked
up the can from where it had rolled from the wreck, and they had
landed right on the beach.

"It doesn't seem to blow so hard," observed Mr. Damon, as he was
tenderly sopping his head with a handkerchief wet in the salt water.

"No, the wind is dying out, but it happened too late to do us any
good," remarked Tom, sorrowfully. "Though if it hadn't blown us this
far, we might have come to grief over the ocean, and be floundering
in that, instead of on dry land."

"That's so," agreed Mr. Fenwick, who was carefully feeling of some
bruises on his legs. "I wonder where we are, anyhow?"

"I haven't the least idea," responded Tom. "It's an island, but
which one, or where it is I don't know. We were blown nearly two
thousand miles, I judge."

He walked over and surveyed the wreck. Now that the excitement was
over he was beginning to be aware of numerous bruises and
contusions, His legs felt rather queer, and on rolling up his
trousers he found there was a deep cut in the right shin, just below
his knee. It was bleeding, but he bandaged it with a spare
handkerchief, and walked on.

Peering about, he saw that nearly the whole of the machinery in the
engine room, including most of the electrical apparatus, had fallen
bodily through the floor, and now rested on the sand.

"That looks to be in pretty good shape." mused Tom, "but it's a
question whether it will ever be any good to us. We can't rebuild
the airship here, that's certain."

He walked about the wreck, and then returned to his friends. Mr.
Damon was more like himself, and Mr. Fenwick had discovered that he
had only minor bruises.

"Bless my coffee cup!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "I declare, I feel
hungry. I wonder if there's anything left to eat in the wreck?"

"Plenty," spoke Tom, cheerfully. "I'll get it out. I can eat a
sandwich or too myself, and perhaps I can set up the gasolene stove,
and cook something."

As the young inventor was returning to the wreck, he was halted
halfway by a curious trembling feeling. At first he thought it was a
weakness of his legs, caused by his cut, but a moment later he
realized with a curious, sickening sensation that it was the ground--the
island itself--that was shaking and trembling.

The lad turned back. Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick were staring after
him with fear showing on their faces.

"What was that?" cried the inventor.

"Bless my gizzard! Did you feel that, Tom?" cried Mr. Damon. "The
whole place is shaking!"

Indeed, there was a stronger tremor now, and it was accompanied by a
low, rumbling sound, like distant thunder. The adventurers were
swaying to and fro.

Suddenly they were tossed to the ground by a swaying motion, and not
far off a great crack opened in the earth. The roaring, rumbling
sound increased in volume.

"An earthquake! It's an earthquake!" cried Tom. "We're in the midst
of an earthquake!"




CHAPTER XIV

A NIGHT IN CAMP


The rumbling and roaring continued for perhaps two minutes, during
which time the castaways found it impossible to stand, for the
island was shaking under their feet with a sickening motion. Off to
one side there was a great fissure in the earth, and, frightened as
he was, Tom looked to see if it was extending in their direction.

If it was, or if a crack opened near them, they might be
precipitated into some bottomless abyss, or into the depths of the
sea. But the fissure did not increase in length or breadth, and,
presently the rumbling, roaring sound subsided. The island grew
quiet and the airship travelers rose to their feet.

"Bless my very existence! What happened?" cried Mr. Damon.

"It was an earthquake; wasn't it, Tom?" asked Mr. Fenwick.

"It sure was," agreed the young inventor. "Rather a hard one, too. I
hope we don't have any more."

"Do you think there is any likelihood of it?" demanded Mr. Damon.
"Bless my pocketbook! If I thought so I'd leave at once."

"Where would you go?" inquired Tom, looking out across the tumbling
ocean, which had hardly had a chance to subside from the gale, ere
it was again set in a turmoil by the earth-tremor.

"That's so--there isn't a place to escape to," went on the eccentric
man, with something like a groan. "We are in a bad place--do you
think there'll be more quakes, Tom?"

"It's hard to say. I don't know where we are, and this island may be
something like Japan, subject to quakes, or it may be that this one
is merely a spasmodic tremor. Perhaps the great storm which brought
us here was part of the disturbance of nature which ended up with
the earthquake. We may have no more."

"And there may be one at any time," added Mr. Fenwick.

"Yes," assented Tom.

"Then let's get ready for it," proposed Mr. Damon. "Let's take all
the precautions possible."

"There aren't any to take," declared Tom. "All we can do is to wait
until the shocks come--if any more do come, which I hope won't
happen, and then we must do the best we can."

"Oh, dear me! Bless my fingernails!" cried Mr. Damon, wringing his
hands. "This is worse than falling in an airship! There you do have
SOME chance. Here you haven't any."

"Oh, it may not be so bad," Tom cried to reassure him. "This may
have been the first shock in a hundred years, and there may never be
another."

But, as he looked around on the island, he noted evidences that it
was of volcanic origin, and his heart misgave him, for he knew that
such islands, created suddenly by a submarine upheaval, might just
as suddenly be destroyed by an earthquake, or by sinking into the
ocean. It was not a pleasant thought--it was like living over a
mine, that might explode at any moment. But there was no help for
it.

Tom tried to assume a cheerfulness he did not feel. He realized
that, in spite of his youth, both Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick rather
depended on him, for Tom was a lad of no ordinary attainments, and
had a fund of scientific knowledge. He resolved to do his best to
avoid making his two companions worry.

"Let's get it off our minds," suggested the lad, after a while. "We
were going to get something to eat. Suppose we carry out that
program. My appetite wasn't spoiled by the shock."

"I declare mine wasn't either," said Mr. Damon, "but I can't forget
it easily. It's the first earthquake I was ever in."

He watched Tom as the latter advanced once more toward the wreck of
the airship, and noticed that the lad limped, for his right leg had
been cut when the WHIZZER had fallen to earth.

"What's the matter, Tom; were you hurt in the quake?" asked the
eccentric man.

"No--no," Tom hastened to assure him. "I just got a bump in the
fall--that's all. It isn't anything. If you and Mr. Fenwick want to
get out some food from the wrecked store room I'll see if I can haul
out the gasolene stove from the airship. Perhaps we can use it to
make some coffee."

By delving in about the wreck, Tom was able to get out the gasolene
stove. It was broken, but two of the five burners were in
commission, and could be used. Water, and gasolene for use in the
airship, was carried in steel tanks. Some of these had been split
open by the crash, but there was one cask of water left, and three
of gasolene, insuring plenty of the liquid fuel. As for the water,
Tom hoped to be able to find a spring on the island.

In the meanwhile, Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick had been investigating
the contents of the storeroom. There was a large supply of food,
much larger than would have been needed, even on a two weeks' trip
in the air, and the inventor of the WHIZZER hardly knew why he had
put so much aboard.

"But if we have to stay here long, it may come in handy," observed
Tom, with a grim smile.

"Why; do you think we WILL be here long?" asked Mr. Damon.

The young inventor shrugged his shoulders.

"There is no telling," he said. "If a passing steamer happens to see
us, we may be taken off to-day or to-morrow. If not we may be here a
week, or--" Tom did not finish. He stood in a listening attitude.

There was a rumbling sound, and the earth seemed again to tremble.
Then there came a great splash in the water at the foot of a tall,
rugged cliff about a quarter of a mile away. A great piece of the
precipice had fallen into the ocean.

"I thought that was another earthquake coming," said Mr. Damon, with
an air of relief.

"So did I," admitted Mr. Fenwick.

"It was probably loosened by the shock, and so fell into the sea,"
spoke Tom.

Their momentary fright over, the castaways proceeded to get their
breakfast. Tom soon had water boiling on the gasolene stove, for he
had rescued a tea-kettle and a coffee pot from the wreck of the
kitchen of the airship. Shortly afterward, the aroma of coffee
filled the air, and a little later there was mingled with it the
appetizing odor of sizzling bacon and eggs, for Mr. Fenwick, who was
very fond of the latter, had brought along a supply, carefully
packed in sawdust carriers, so that the shock had broken only a few
of them.

"Well, I call this a fine breakfast," exclaimed Mr. Damon, munching
his bacon and eggs, and dipping into his coffee the hard pilot
biscuit, which they had instead of bread. "We're mighty lucky to be
eating at all, I suppose."

"Indeed we are," chimed in Mr. Fenwick.

"I'm awfully sorry the airship is wrecked, though," spoke Tom. "I
suppose it's my fault. I should have turned back before we got over
the ocean, and while the storm was not at its height. I saw that the
wind was freshening, but I never supposed it would grow to a gale so
suddenly. The poor old WHIZZER--there's not much left of her!"

"Now don't distress yourself in the least," insisted Mr. Fenwick.
"I'm proud to have built a ship that could navigate at all. I see
where I made lots of mistakes, and as soon as I get back to
Philadelphia, I'm going to build a better one, if you'll help me,
Tom Swift."

"I certainly will," promised the young inventor.

"And I'll take a voyage with you!" cried Mr. Damon. "Bless my
teaspoon, Tom, but will you kindly pass the bacon and eggs again!"

There was a jolly laugh at the eccentric man, in which he himself
joined, and the little party felt better. They were seated on bits
of broken boxes taken from the wreck, forming a little circle about
the gasolene stove, which Tom had set up on the beach. The wind had
almost entirely died away, though the sea was still heaving in great
billows, and masses of surf.

They had no exact idea of the time, for all their watches had
stopped when the shock of the wreck came, but presently the sun
peeped out from the clouds, and, from knowing the time when they had
begun to fall, they judged it was about ten o'clock, and accordingly
set their timepieces.

"Well," observed Tom, as he collected the dishes, which they had
also secured from the wreck, "we must begin to think about a place
to spend the night. I think we can rig up a shelter from some of the
canvas of the wing-planes, and from what is left of the cabin. It
doesn't need to be very heavy, for from the warmth of the
atmosphere, I should say we were pretty well south."

It was quite warm, now that the storm was over, and, as they looked
at the vegetation of the island, they saw that it was almost wholly
tropical.

"I shouldn't be surprised if we were on one of the smaller of the
West Indian islands," said Tom. "We certainly came far enough,
flying a hundred miles or more an hour, to have reached them. But
this one doesn't appear to be inhabited."

"We haven't been all over it yet," said Mr. Damon. "We may find
cannibals on the other side."

"Cannibals don't live in this part of the world," Tom assured him.
"No, I think this island is practically unknown. The storm brought
us here, and it might have landed us in a worse place."

As he spoke he thought of the yacht RESOLUTE, and he wondered how
her passengers, including the parents of Mary Nestor, had fared
during the terrible blow.

"I hope they weren't wrecked, as we were," mused Tom.

But there was little time for idle thoughts. If they were going to
build a shelter, they knew that they must speedily get at it.
Accordingly, with a feeling of thankfulness that their lives had
been spared, they set to work taking apart such of the wreck as
could the more easily be got at.

Boards, sticks, and planks were scattered about, and, with the
pieces of canvas from the wing-planes, and some spare material which
was carried on board, they soon had a fairly good shack, which would
be protection enough in that warm climate.

Next they got out the food and supplies, their spare clothing and
other belongings, few of which had been harmed in the fall from the
clouds. These things were piled under another rude shelter which
they constructed.

By this time it was three o'clock, and they ate again. Then they
prepared to spend the night in their hastily made camp. They
collected driftwood, with which to make a fire, and, after supper,
which was prepared on the gasolene stove, they sat about the
cheerful blaze, discussing their adventures.

"To-morrow we will explore the island," said Tom, as he rolled
himself up in his blankets and turned over to sleep. The others
followed his example, for it was decided that no watch need be kept.
Thus passed several hours in comparative quiet.

It must have been about midnight that Tom was suddenly awakened by a
feeling as if someone was shaking him. He sat up quickly and called
out:

"What's the matter?"

"Eh? What's that? Bless my soul! What's going on?" shouted Mr.
Damon.

"Did you shake me?" inquired Tom.

"I? No. What--?"

Then they realized that another earth-tremor was making the whole
island tremble.

Tom leaped from his blankets, followed by Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick,
and rushed outside the shack. They felt the earth shaking, but it
was over in a few seconds. The shock was a slight one, nothing like
as severe as the one in the morning. But it set their nerves on
edge.

"Another earthquake!" groaned Mr. Damon. "How often are we to have
them?"

"I don't know," answered Tom, soberly.

They passed the remainder of the night sleeping in blankets on the
warm sands, near the fire, for they feared lest a shock might bring
the shack down about their heads. However, the night passed with no
more terrors.




CHAPTER XV

THE OTHER CASTAWAYS


"Well, we're all alive, at any rate," announced Tom, when the bright
sun, shining into his eyes, had awakened him. He sat up, tossed
aside his blankets, and stood up. The day was a fine one, and the
violence of the sea had greatly subsided during the night, their
shack had suffered not at all from the slight shock in the darkness.

"Now for a dip in old Briney," the lad added, as he walked down to
the surf, "I think it will make me feel better."

"I'm with you," added Mr. Fenwick, and Mr. Damon also joined the
bathers. They came up from the waves, tingling with health, and
their bruises and bumps, including Tom's cut leg, felt much better.

"You did get quite a gash; didn't you," observed Mr. Fenwick, as he
noticed Tom's leg. "Better put something on it. I have antiseptic
dressings and bandages in the airship, if we can find them."

"I'll look for them, after breakfast," Tom promised, and following a
fairly substantial meal, considering the exigencies under which it
was prepared, he got out the medicine chest, of which part remained
in the wreck of the WHIZZER, and dressed his wound. He felt much
better after that.

"Well, what's our program for to-day?" Mr. Damon wanted to know, as
they sat about, after they had washed up what few dishes they used.

"Let's make a better house to stay in," proposed Mr. Fenwick. "We
may have to remain here for some time, and I'd like a more
substantial residence."

"I think the one we now have will do," suggested Tom. "I was going
to propose making it even less substantial."

"Why so?"

"Because, in the event of an earthquake, while we are sleeping in
it, we will not be injured. Made of light pieces of wood and canvas
it can't harm us very much if it falls on us."

"That's right," agreed Mr. Damon. "In earthquake countries all the
houses are low, and built of light materials."

"Ha! So I recollect now," spoke Mr. Fenwick. "I used to read that in
my geography, but I never thought it would apply to me. But do you
think we will be subject to the quakes?"

"I'm afraid so," was Tom's reply. "We've had two, now, within a
short time, and there is no way of telling when the next will come.
We will hope there won't be any more, but--"

He did not finish his sentence, but the others knew what he meant.
Thereupon they fell to work, and soon had made a shelter that, while
very light and frail, would afford them all the protection needed in
that mild climate, and, at the same time, there would be no danger
should an earthquake collapse it, and bring it down about their
heads while they were sleeping in it.

For they decided that they needed some shelter from the night dews,
as it was exceedingly uncomfortable to rest on the sands even
wrapped in blankets, and with a driftwood fire burning nearby.

It was noon when they had their shack rebuilt to their liking, and
they stopped for dinner. There was quite a variety of stores in the
airship, enough for a much larger party than that of our three
friends, and they varied their meals as much as possible. Of course
all the stuff they had was canned, though there are some salted and
smoked meats. But canned food can be had in a variety of forms
now-a-days, so the castaways did not lack much.

"What do you say to an exploring expedition this afternoon?" asked
Tom, as they sat about after dinner. "We ought to find out what kind
of an island we're on."

"I agree with you," came from Mr. Fenwick. "Perhaps on the other
side we will stand a much better chance of speaking some passing
vessel. I have been watching the horizon for some time, now, but I
haven't seen the sign of a ship."

"All right, then we'll explore, and see what sort of an island we
have taken possession of," went on Tom.

"And see if it isn't already in possession of natives--or
cannibals," suggested Mr. Damon. "Bless my frying pan! but I should
hate to be captured by cannibals at my time of life."

"Don't worry; there are none here," Tom assured him again.

They set out on their journey around the island. They agreed that it
would be best to follow the beach around, as it was easier walking
that way, since the interior of the place consisted of rugged rocks
in a sort of miniature mountain chain.

"We will make a circuit of the place," proposed Tom, "and then, if
we can discover nothing, we'll go inland. The centre of the island
is quite high, and we ought to be able to see in any direction for a
great distance from the topmost peak. We may be able to signal a
vessel."

"I hope so!" cried Mr. Damon. "I want to send word home that I am
all right. My wife will worry when she learns that the airship, in
which I set out, has disappeared."

"I fancy we all would like to send word home," added Mr. Fenwick.
"My wife never wanted me to build this airship, and, now that I have
sailed in it, and have been wrecked, I know she'll say 'I told you
so,' as soon as I get back to Philadelphia."

Tom said nothing, but he thought to himself that it might be some
time before Mrs. Fenwick would have a chance to utter those
significant words to her husband.

Following the beach line, they walked for several miles. The island
was larger than they had supposed, and it soon became evident that
it would take at least a day to get all around it.

"In which case we will need some lunch with us." said Tom. "I think
the best thing we can do now is to return to camp, and get ready for
a longer expedition to-morrow."

Mr. Fenwick was of the same mind, but Mr. Damon called out:

"Let's go just beyond that cliff, and see what sort of a view is to
be had from there. Then we'll turn back."

To oblige him they followed. They had not gone more than a hundred
yards toward the cliff, than there came the preliminary rumbling and
roaring that they had come to associate with an earthquake. At the
same time, the ground began to shiver and shake.

"Here comes another one!" cried Tom, reeling about. He saw Mr. Damon
and Mr. Fenwick topple to the beach. The roaring increased, and the
rumbling was like thunder, close at hand. The island seemed to rock
to its very centre.

Suddenly the whole cliff toward which they had been walking,
appeared to shake itself loose. In another instant it was flung
outward and into the sea, a great mass of rock and stone.

The island ceased trembling, and the roaring stopped. Tom rose to
his feet, followed by his companions. He looked toward the place
where the cliff had been. Its removal by the earthquake gave them a
view of a part of the beach that had hitherto been hidden from them.

And what Tom saw caused him to cry out in astonishment. For he
beheld, gathered around a little fire on the sand, a party of men
and women. Some were standing, clinging to one another in terror.
Some were prostrate on the ground. Others were running to and fro in
bewilderment.

"More castaways!" cried Tom. "More castaways," and, he added under
his breath, "more unfortunates on earthquake island!"




CHAPTER XVI

AN ALARMING THEORY


For a few seconds, following Tom's announcement to his two
companions, neither Mr. Damon nor Mr. Fenwick spoke. They had arisen
from the beach, where the shock of the earthquake had thrown them,
and were now staring toward the other band of castaways, who, in
turn were gazing toward our three friends. There was a violent
agitation in the sea, caused by the fall of the great cliff, and
immense waves rushed up on shore, but all the islanders were beyond
the reach of the rollers.

"Is it--do I really--am I dreaming or not?" at length gasped Mr.
Damon.

"Is this a mirage, or do we really see people, Tom?" inquired Mr.
Fenwick.

"They are real enough people," replied the lad, himself somewhat
dazed by the unexpected appearance of the other castaways.

"But how--why--how did they get here?" went on the inventor of the
WHIZZER.

"As long as they're not cannibals, we're all right," murmured Mr.
Damon. "They seem to be persons like ourselves, Tom."

"They are," agreed the lad, "and they appear to be in the same sort
of trouble as ourselves. Let's go forward, and meet them."

The tremor of the earthquake had now subsided, and the little band
that was gathered about a big fire of driftwood was calmer. Those
who had fallen, or who had thrown themselves on the sand, arose, and
began feeling of their arms and legs to see if they had sustained
any injuries. Others advanced toward our friends.

"Nine of them," murmured Tom, as he counted the little band of
castaways, "and they don't seem to have been able to save much from
the wreck of their craft, whatever it was." The beach all about them
was bare, save for a boat drawn up out of reach of high water.

"Do you suppose they are a party from some disabled airship, Tom,"
asked Mr. Fenwick.

"Not from an airship," answered the lad. "Probably from some vessel
that was wrecked in the gale. But we will soon find out who they
are."

Tom led the way for his two friends. The fall of the cliff had made
a rugged path around the base of it, over rocks, to where the other
people stood. Tom scrambled in and out among the boulders, in spite
of the pain it caused his wounded leg. He was anxious to know who
the other castaways were, and how they had come there.

Several of the larger party were now advancing to meet the lad and
his friends. Tom could see two women and seven men.

A moment later, when the lad had a good view of one of the ladies
and a gentleman, he could not repress a cry of astonishment. Then he
rubbed his eyes to make sure it was not some blur or defect of
vision. No, his first impression had been correct.

"Mr. Nestor!" cried Tom, recognizing the father of his girl friend.
"And Mrs. Nestor!" he added a moment later.

"Why--of all things--look--Amos--it's--it can't be possible--and
yet--why, it's Tom Swift!" cried the lady.

"Tom--Tom Swift--here?" ejaculated the man at her side.

"Yes--Tom Swift--the young inventor--of Shopton--don't you know--the
lad who saved Mary's life in the runaway--Tom Swift!"

"Tom Swift!" murmured Mr. Nestor. "Is it possible!"

"I'm Tom Swift, all right," answered the owner of that name, "but
how in the world did you get on this island, Mr. Nestor?"

"I might ask you the same thing, Tom. The yacht RESOLUTE, on which
we were making a voyage to the West Indies, as guests of Mr. George
Hosbrook, was wrecked in the awful gale. We took to the boats and
managed to reach this island. The yacht sunk, and we only had a
little food. We are almost starved! But how came you here?"

"Mr. Fenwick's airship was wrecked, and we dropped down here. What a
coincidence! To think that I should meet you here! But if you're
hungry, it's the best thing in the world that we met you, for,
though our airship was wrecked, we have a large supply of food. Come
over to our camp, and we'll give you all you want!"

Tom had rushed forward, and was shaking hands with Mary's parents,
so unexpectedly met with, when Mr. Nestor called out:

"Come over here, Mr. Hosbrook. I want you to meet a friend of mine."

A moment later, the millionaire owner of the ill-fated RESOLUTE was
shaking hands with Tom.

"I can't understand it," Mr. Hosbrook said. "To think of meeting
other people on this desolate island--this island of earthquakes."

"Oh, please don't speak of earthquakes!" cried Mrs. Nestor. "We are
in mortal terror! There have been several since we landed in the
most terrible storm day before yesterday. Isn't it awful! It is a
regular earthquake island!"

"That's what I call it," spoke Tom, grimly.

The others of the larger party of refugees now came up. Besides Mr.
and Mrs. Nestor, and Mr. Hosbrook, there was Mr. and Mrs. Floyd
Anderson, friends of the millionaire; Mr. Ralph Parker, who was
spoken of as a scientist, Mr. Barcoe Jenks, who seemed an odd sort
of individual, always looking about suspiciously, Captain Mentor,
who had been in command of the yacht, and Jake Fordam, the mate of
the vessel.

"And are these all who were saved?" asked Tom, as he introduced his
two friends, and told briefly of their air voyage.

"No," answered Mr. Hosbrook, "two other boatloads, one containing
most of the crew, and the other containing some of my guests, got
away before our boat left. I trust they have been rescued, but we
have heard nothing about them. However, our own lives may not long
be safe, if these earthquakes continue."

"But did I understand you to say, Mr. Swift, that you had food?" he
went on. "If you have, I will gladly pay you any price for some,
especially for these two ladies, who must be faint. I have lost all
my ready cash, but if we ever reach civilization, I will--"

"Don't speak of such a thing as pay," interrupted Mr. Fenwick. "All
that we have we'll gladly share with you. Come over to our camp. We
have enough for all, and we can cook on our gasolene stove. Don't
speak of pay, I beg of you."

"Ah--er, if Mr. Hosbrook has no money, perhaps I can offer an
equivalent," broke in the man who had been introduced as Barcoe
Jenks. "I have--er--some securities--" He stopped and looked about
indefinitely, as though he did not know exactly what to say, and he
was fumbling at a belt about his waist; a belt that might contain
treasure.

"Don't speak of reimbursing us," went on Mr. Fenwick, with rather a
suspicious glance at Mr. Jenks. "You are welcome to whatever we
have."

"Bless my topknot; certainly, yes!" joined in Mr. Damon, eagerly.

"Well, I--er--I only spoke of it," said Mr. Jenks, hesitatingly, and
then he turned away. Mr. Hosbrook looked sharply at him, but said
nothing.

"Suppose we go to our camp," proposed Tom. "We may be able to get
you up a good meal, before another earthquake comes."

"I wonder what makes so many of them?" asked Mrs. Nestor, with a
nervous shiver.

"Yes, indeed, they are terrifying! One never knows when to expect
them," added Mrs. Anderson.

"I have a theory about them," said Mr. Parker, the scientist, who,
up to this time had spoken but little.

"A theory?" inquired Tom.

"Yes. This island is one of the smaller of the West Indies group. It
is little known, and has seldom been visited, I believe. But I am
sure that what causes the earthquakes is that the whole island has
been undermined by the sea, and it is the wash of great submarine
waves and currents which cause the tremors."

"Undermined by the sea?" repeated Tom.

"Yes. It is being slowly washed away."

"Bless my soul! Washed away!" gasped Mr. Damon.

"And, in the course of a comparatively short time, it will sink,"
went on the scientist, as cheerfully as though he was a professor
propounding some problem to his class.

"Sink!" ejaculated Mrs. Nestor. "The whole island undermined! Oh,
what an alarming theory!"

"I wish I could hold to a different one, madam," was Mr. Parker's
answer, "but I cannot. I think the island will sink after a few more
shocks."

"Then what good will my--" began Barcoe Jenks, but he stopped in
confusion, and again his hand went to his belt with a queer gesture.




CHAPTER XVII

A MIGHTY SHOCK


Tom Swift turned to gaze at Mr. Barcoe Jenks. That individual
certainly had a strange manner. Perhaps it might be caused by the
terror of the earthquakes, but the man seemed to be trying to hold
back some secret. He was constrained and ill at ease. He saw the
young inventor looking at him, and his hands, which had gone to his
belt, with a spasmodic motion, dropped to his side.

"You don't really mean to say, Parker, that you think the whole
island is undermined, do you?" asked the owner of the RESOLUTE.

"That's my theory. It may be a wrong one, but it is borne out by the
facts already presented to us. I greatly fear for our lives!"

"But what can we do?" cried Mrs. Nestor.

"Nothing," answered the scientist, with a shrug of his shoulders.
"Absolutely nothing, save to wait for it to happen."

"Don't say that!" begged Mrs. Andersen.

"Can't you gentlemen do something--build a boat and take us away.
Why, the boat we came here in--"

"Struck a rock, and stove a hole in the bottom as big as a barrel,
madam," interrupted Captain Mentor. "It would never do to put to sea
in that."

"But can't something else be done?" demanded Mrs. Nestor. "Oh, it is
awful to think of perishing on this terrible earthquake island. Oh,
Amos! Think of it, and Mary home alone! Have you seen her lately,
Mr. Swift?"

Tom told of his visit to the Nestors' home. Our hero was almost in
despair, not so much for himself, as for the unfortunate women of
the party--and one of them was Mary's mother! Yet what could he do?
What chance was there of escaping from the earthquake?

"Bless my gizzard!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Don't let's stand here
worrying! If you folks are hungry come up to our camp. We have
plenty. Afterward we can discuss means of saving ourselves."

"I want to be saved!" exclaimed Mr. Jenks. "I must be saved! I have
a great secret--a secret--"

Once more he paused in confusion, and once more his hands nervously
sought his belt.

"I would give a big reward to be saved," he murmured.

"And so, I fancy, we all would," added Captain Mentor. "But we are
not likely to. This island is out of the track of the regular line
of vessels."

"Where are we, anyhow?" inquired Mr. Fenwick. "What island is this?"

"It isn't down on the charts, I believe," was the captain's reply,
"but we won't be far out, if we call it Earthquake Island. That name
seems to fit it exactly."

They had walked on, while talking, and now had gone past the broken
cliff. Tom and his two friends of the airship led the way to the
camp they had made. On the way, Mr. Hosbrook related how his yacht
had struggled in vain against the tempest, how she had sprung a
leak, how the fires had gone out, and how, helpless in the trough of
the sea, the gallant vessel began to founder. Then they had taken to
the boats, and had, most unexpectedly come upon the island.

"And since we landed we have had very little to eat," said Mrs.
Nestor. "We haven't had a place to sleep, and it has been terrible.
Then, too, the earthquakes! And my husband and I worried so about
Mary. Oh, Mr. Swift! Do you think there is any chance of us ever
seeing her again?"

"I don't know," answered Tom, softly. "I'll do all I can to get us
off this island. Perhaps we can build a raft, and set out. If we
stay here there is no telling what will happen, if that scientist's
theory is correct. But there is our camp, just ahead. You will be
more comfortable, at least for a little while."

In a short time they were at the place where Tom and the others had
built the shack. The ruins of the airship were examined with
interest, and the two women took advantage of the seclusion of the
little hut, to get some much needed rest until a meal should be
ready.

One was soon in course of preparation by Tom and Mr. Damon, aided by
Mate Fordam, of the RESOLUTE. Fortunate it was that Mr. Fenwick had
brought along such a supply of food, for there were now many mouths
to feed.

That the supper (which the meal really was, for it was getting late)
was much enjoyed, goes without saying. The yacht castaways had
subsisted on what little food had been hurriedly put into the life
boat, as they left the vessel.

At Tom's request, while it was yet light, Captain Mentor and some of
the men hunted for a spring of fresh water, and found one, for, with
the increase in the party, the young inventor saw the necessity for
more water. The spring gave promise of supplying a sufficient
quantity.

There was plenty of material at hand for making other shacks, and
they were soon in course of construction. They were made light, as
was the one Tom and his friends first built, so that, in case of
another shock, no one would be hurt seriously. The two ladies were
given the larger shack, and the men divided themselves between two
others that were hastily erected on the beach. The remainder of the
food and stores was taken from the wreck of the airship, and when
darkness began to fall, the camp was snug and comfortable, a big
fire of driftwood burning brightly.

"Oh, if only we can sleep without being awakened by an earthquake!"
exclaimed Mrs. Nestor, as she prepared to go into the shack with
Mrs. Anderson. "But I am almost afraid to close my eyes!"

"If it would do any good to stay up and watch, to tell you when one
was coming, I'd do so," spoke Tom, with a laugh, "but they come
without warning."

However, the night did pass peacefully, and there was not the least
tremor of the island. In the morning the castaways took courage and,
after breakfast, began discussing their situation more calmly.

"It seems to me that the only solution is to build some sort of a
raft, or other craft and leave the island," said Mr. Fenwick.

"Bless my hair brush!" cried Mr. Damon. "Why can't we hoist a signal
of distress, and wait for some steamer to see it and call for us? It
seems to me that would be more simple than going to sea on a raft. I
don't like the idea."

"A signal would be all right, if this island was in the path of the
steamers," said Captain Mentor. "But it isn't. Our flag might fly
for a year, and never be seen."

His words seemed to strike coldness to every heart. Tom, who was
looking at the wreck of the airship, suddenly uttered an
exclamation. He sprang to his feet.

"What is it?" demanded Mr. Fenwick. "Does your sore leg hurt you?"

"No, but I have just thought of a plan!" fairly shouted the young
inventor. "I have it! Wait and see if I can work it!"

"Work what?" cried Mr. Damon.

Tom did not get a chance to answer, for, at that moment, there
sounded, at the far end of the island, whence the yacht castaways
had come, a terrific crash. It was accompanied, rather than
followed, by a shaking, trembling and swaying of the ground.

"Another earthquake!" screamed Mrs. Nestor, rushing toward her
husband. The castaways gazed at each other affrighted.

Suddenly, before their eyes, they saw the extreme end of that part
of the island on which they were camping, slip off, and beneath the
foaming waves of the sea, while the echoes of the mighty crash came
to their ears!




CHAPTER XVIII

MR. JENKS HAS DIAMONDS


Stunned, and well-nigh paralyzed by the suddenness of the awful
crash, and the recurrence of the earthquake, the castaways gazed
spell-bound at one another.

Succeeding the disappearance of the end of the island there arose a
great wave in the ocean, caused by the immersion of such a quantity
of rock and dirt.

"Look out!" yelled Tom, "there may be a flood here!"

They realized his meaning, and hastened up the beach, out of reach
of the water if it should come. And it did. At first the ocean
retreated, as though the tide was going out, then, with a rush and
roar, the waves came leaping back, and, had the castaways remained
where they had been standing they would have been swept out to sea.

As it was the flood reached part of the wreck of the airship, that
lay on the beach, and washed away some of the broken planks. But,
after the first rush of water, the sea grew less troubled, and there
was no more danger from that source.

True, the whole island was rumbling and trembling in the throes of
an earthquake, but, by this time, the refugees had become somewhat
used to this, and only the two ladies exhibited any outward signs of
great alarm, though Mr. Barcoe Jenks, Tom observed, was nervously
fingering the belt which he wore about his waist.

"I guess the worst is over," spoke Mr. Fenwick, as they stood
looking toward where part of the island had vanished. "The shock
expended itself on tearing that mass of rock and earth away."

"Let us hope so," added Mr. Hosbrook, solemnly. "Oh, if we could
only get away from this terrible place! We must hoist a signal of
distress, even if we are out of the track of regular vessels. Some
ship, blown out of her course may see it. Captain Mentor, I wish you
and Mr. Fordam would attend to that."

"I will, sir," answered the commander of the ill-fated RESOLUTE.
"The signal shall be hoisted at once. Come on, Mr. Fordam," he
added, turning to the first mate.

"If you don't mind," interrupted Tom, "I wish you would first help
me to get what remains of the airship up out of reach of any more
possible high waves. That one nearly covered it, and if there are
other big rollers, the wreck may be washed out to sea."

"I can't see that any great harm would result from that," put in Mr.
Jenks. "There isn't anything about the wreck that we could use to
make a boat or raft from." Indeed, there was little left of the
airship, save the mass of machinery.

"Well, it may come in handy before we leave here," said Tom, and
there was a quiet determined air about him, that caused Mr. Damon to
look at him curiously. The odd gentleman started to utter one of his
numerous blessings, and to ask Tom a question, but he thought better
of it. By this time the earthquake had ceased, and the castaways
were calmer.

Tom started toward the airship wreck, and began pulling off some
broken boards to get at the electrical machinery.

"I guess you had better give Mr. Swift a hand, Captain Mentor,"
spoke the millionaire yacht owner. "I don't know what good the wreck
can be, but we owe considerable to Mr. Swift and his friends, and
the least we can do is to aid them in anything they ask. So,
Captain, if you don't mind, you and the mate bear a hand. In fact,
we'll all help, and move the wreck so far up that there will be no
danger, even from tidal waves."

Tom looked pleased at this order, and soon he and all the men in the
little party were busy taking out the electrical apparatus, and
moving it farther inland.

"What are you going to do with it, Tom?" asked Mr. Damon, in a low
voice, as he assisted the young inventor to carry a small dynamo,
that was used for operating the incandescent lights.

"I hardly know myself. I have a half-formed plan in my mind. I may
be able to carry it out, and I may not. I don't want to say anything
until I look over the machinery, and see if all the parts which I
need are here. Please say nothing about it."

"Bless my toothpick! Of course, I'll not," promised Mr. Damon.

When the removal of most of the machinery of the wrecked airship had
been completed, Mrs. Nestor exclaimed:

"Well, since you are moving that out of harm's way, don't you think
it would be a good idea to change our camp, also? I'm sure I'll
never sleep a wink, thinking that part of the island may fall into
the ocean at any moment in the night, and create a wave that may
wash us all out to sea. Can't we move the camp, Mr. Swift?"

"No reason why we can't," answered the lad, smiling. "I think it
would be a good plan to take it farther back. We are likely to be
here some time, and, while we are about it, we might build more
complete shelters, and have a few more comforts."

The others agreed with this idea, so the little shacks that had been
erected were taken down, and moved to higher ground, where a better
outlook could be had of the surrounding ocean. At the same time as
safe a place as possible, considering the frequent earthquakes, was
picked out--a place where there were no overhanging rocks or cliffs.

Three huts were built, one for the two ladies, one for the men, and
third where the cooking could be done. This last also held the food
supplies and stores, and Tom noted, with satisfaction, that there
was still sufficient to eat to last over a week. Mr. Fenwick had not
stinted his kitchen stores.

This work done, Captain Mentor and Mate Fordam went to the highest
part of the island, where they erected a signal, made from pieces of
canvas that had been in the life boat. The boat itself was brought
around to the new camp, and at first it was hoped that it could be
repaired, and used. But too large a hole had been stove in the
bottom, so it was broken up, and the planks used in making the
shacks.

This work occupied the better part of two days, and during this
time, there were no more earthquakes. The castaways began to hope
that the island would not be quiet for a while. Mrs. Anderson and
Mrs. Nestor assumed charge of the "housekeeping" arrangements, and
also the cooking, which relieved Tom from those duties. The two
ladies even instituted "wash-day," and when a number of garments
were hung on lines to dry, the camp looked like some summer colony
of pleasure-seekers, out for a holiday.

In the meanwhile, Tom had spent most of his time among the machinery
which had been taken from the airship. He inspected it carefully,
tested some of the apparatus, and made some calculations on a bit of
paper. He seemed greatly pleased over something, and one afternoon,
when he was removing some of the guy and stay wires from the
collapsed frame of the WHIZZER, he was approached by Mr. Barcoe
Jenks.

"Planning something new?" asked Mr. Jenks, with an attempt at
jollity, which, however, failed. The man had a curious air about
him, as if he was carrying some secret that was too much for him.

"Well, nothing exactly new," answered Tom. "At best I am merely
going to try an experiment."

"An experiment, eh?" resumed Mr. Jenks, "And might I ask if it has
anything to do with rescuing us from this island?"

"I hope it will have," answered Tom, gravely.

"Good!" exclaimed Mr. Jenks. "Well, now I have a proposition to make
to you. I suppose you are not very wealthy, Mr. Swift?" He gazed at
Tom, quizzically.

"I am not poor," was the young inventor's proud answer, "but I would
be glad to make more money--legitimately."

"I thought so. Most every one would. Look here!"

He approached closer to Tom, and, pulling his hand from his pocket,
held it extended, in the palm were a number of irregularly-shaped
objects--stones or crystals the lad took them to be, yet they did
not look like ordinary stones or crystals.

"Do you know what those are?" asked Mr. Jenks.

"I might guess," replied Tom.

"I'll save you the trouble. They are diamonds! Diamonds of the very
first water, but uncut. Now to the point. I have half a million
dollars worth of them. If you get me safely off this island, I will
agree to make you a quarter of a million dollars worth of diamonds!"

"Make me a quarter of a million dollars worth of diamonds?" asked
Tom, struck by the use of the work "make."

"Yes, 'make,'" answered Mr. Jenks. "That is if I can discover the
secret--the secret of Phantom Mountain. Get me away from the island
and I will share my knowledge with you--I need help--help to learn
the secret and help to make the diamonds--see, there are some of the
first ones made, but I have been defrauded of my rights--I need the
aid of a young fellow like you. Will you help? See, I'll give you
some diamonds now. They are genuine, though they are not like
ordinary diamonds. I made them. Will you--"

Before Tom could answer, there came a warning rumble of the earth,
and a great fissure opened, almost at the feet of Mr. Jenks, who,
with a cry of fear, leaped toward the young inventor.




CHAPTER XIX

SECRET OPERATIONS


"Help me save this machinery!" yelled Tom, whose first thought was
for the electrical apparatus. "Don't let it fall into that chasm!"

For the crack had widened, until it was almost to the place where
the parts of the wrecked airship had been carried.

"The machinery? What do I care about the machinery?" cried Mr.
Jenks. "I want to save my life!"

"And this machinery is our only hope!" retorted Tom. He began
tugging at the heavy dynamos and gasolene engine, but he might have
saved himself the trouble, for with the same suddenness with which
it opened, the crack closed again. The shock had done it, and, as if
satisfied with that phenomena, the earthquake ceased, and the island
no longer trembled.

"That was a light one," spoke Tom, with an air of relief. He was
becoming used to the shocks now, and, when he saw that his precious
machinery was not damaged he could view the earth tremors calmly.

"Slight!" exclaimed Mr. Jenks. "Well, I don't call it so. But I see
Captain Mentor and Mr. Hosbrook coming. Please don't say anything to
them about the diamonds. I'll see you again," and with that, the
queer Mr. Jenks walked away.

"We came to see if you were hurt," called the captain, as he neared
the young inventor.

"No, I'm all right. How about the others?"

"Only frightened," replied the yacht owner. "This is getting awful.
I hoped we were free from the shocks, but they still continue."

"And I guess they will," added Tom. "We certainly are on Earthquake
Island!"

"Mr. Parker, the scientist, says this last shock bears out his
theory," went on the millionaire. "He says it will be only a
question of a few days when the whole island will disappear."

"Comforting, to say the least," commented Tom.

"I should say so. But what are you doing, Mr. Swift?"

"Trying an experiment," answered the young inventor, in some
confusion. He was not yet ready to talk about his plans.

"We must begin to think seriously of building some sort of a boat or
raft, and getting away from the island," went on the millionaire.
"It will be perilous to go to sea with anything we can construct,
but it is risking our lives to stay here. I don't know what to do."

"Perhaps Captain Mentor has some plan," suggested Tom, hoping to
change the subject.

"No," answered the commander, "I confess I am at a loss to know what
to do. There is nothing with which to do anything, that is the
trouble! But I did think of hoisting another signal, on this end of
the island, where it might be seen if our first one wasn't. I
believe I'll do that," and he moved away, to carry out his
intention.

"Well, I think I'll get back, Tom, and tell the others that you are
all right," spoke Mr. Hosbrook. "I left the camp, after the shock,
because Mrs. Nestor was worried about you." The place to which the
airship machinery had been removed was some distance from the camp,
and out of sight of the shacks.

"Oh, yes. I'm all right," said Tom. Then, with a sudden impulse, he
asked:

"Do you know much about this Mr. Barcoe Jenks, Mr. Hosbrook?"

"Not a great deal," was the reply. "In fact, I may say I do not know
him at all. Why do you ask?"

"Because I thought he acted rather strangely."

"Just what the rest of us think," declared the yacht owner. "He is
no friend of mine, though he was my guest on the RESOLUTE. It came
about in this way. I had invited a Mr. Frank Jackson to make the
trip with me, and he asked if he could bring with him a Mr. Jenks, a
friend of his. I assented, and Mr. Jackson came aboard with Mr.
Jenks. Just as we were about to sail Mr. Jackson received a message
requiring his presence in Canada, and he could not make the trip."

"But Mr. Jenks seemed so cut-up about being deprived of the yachting
trip, and was so fond of the water, that I invited him to remain on
board, even if his friend did not. So that is how he came to be
among my guests, though he is a comparative stranger to all of us."

"I see," spoke Tom.

"Has he been acting unusually strange?" asked Mr. Hosbrook
suspiciously.

"No, only he seemed very anxious to get off the island, but I
suppose we all are. He wanted to know what I planned to do."

"Did you tell him?"

"No, for the reason that I don't know whether I can succeed or not,
and I don't want to raise false hopes."

"Then you would prefer not to tell any of us?"

"No one--that is except Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Damon. I may need them
to help me."

"I see," responded Mr. Hosbrook. "Well, whatever it is, I wish you
luck. It is certainly a fearful place--this island," and busy with
many thoughts, which crowded upon him, the millionaire moved away,
leaving Tom alone.

A little while after this Tom might have been seen in close
conversation with Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick. The former, on hearing
what the young inventor had to say, blessed himself and his various
possessions so often, that he seemed to have gotten out of breath.
Mr. Fenwick exclaimed:

"Tom, if you can work that it will be one of the greatest things you
have ever done!"

"I hope I can work it," was all the young inventor replied.

For the next three days Tom, and his two friends, spent most of
their time in the neighborhood of the pile of machinery and
apparatus taken from the wrecked WHIZZER. Mr. Jenks hung around the
spot, but a word or two from Mr. Hosbrook sent him away, and our
three friends were left to their work in peace, for they were
inclined to be secretive about their operations, as Tom did not want
his plans known until he was ready.

The gasolene motor was overhauled, and put in shape to work. Then it
was attached to the dynamo. When this much had been done, Tom and
his friends built a rude shack around the machinery shutting it from
view.

"Humph! Are you afraid we will steal it?" asked Mr. Parker, the
scientist, who held to his alarming theory regarding the ultimate
disappearance of the island.

"No, I simply want to protect it from the weather," answered Tom.
"You will soon know all our plans. I think they will work out."

"You'd better do it before we get another earthquake, and the island
sinks," was the dismal response.

But there had been no shocks since the one that nearly engulfed Mr.
Jenks. As for that individual he said little to any one, and
wandered off alone by himself. Tom wondered what kind of diamonds
they were that the odd man had, and the lad even had his doubts as
to the value of the queer stones he had seen. But he was too busy
with his work to waste much time in idle speculation.




CHAPTER XX

THE WIRELESS PLANT


The castaways had been on Earthquake Island a week now, and in that
time had suffered many shocks. Some were mere tremors, and some were
so severe as to throw whole portions of the isle into the sea. They
never could tell when a shock was coming, and often one awakened
them in the night.

But, in spite of this, the refugees were as cheerful as it was
possible to be under the circumstances. Only Mr. Jenks seemed
nervous and ill at ease, and he kept much by himself.

As for Tom, Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick, the three were busy in their
shack. The others had ceased to ask questions about what they were
doing, and Mr. Nestor and his wife took it for granted that Tom was
building a boat.

Captain Mentor and the mate spent much time gazing off to sea,
hoping for a sight of the sail of some vessel, or the haze that
would indicate the smoke of a steamer. But they saw nothing.

"I haven't much hope of sighting anything," the captain said. "I
know we are off the track of the regular liners, and our only chance
would be that some tramp steamer, or some ship blown off her course,
would see our signal. I tell you, friends, we're in a bad way."

"If money was any object--," began Mr. Jenks.

"What good would money be?" demanded Mr. Hosbrook. "What we need to
do is to get a message to some one--some of my friends--to send out
a party to rescue us."

"That's right," chimed in Mr. Parker, the scientist. "And the
message needs to go off soon, if we are to be saved."

"Why so?" asked Mr. Anderson.

"Because I think this island will sink inside of a week!"

A scream came from the two ladies.

"Why don't you keep such thoughts to yourself?" demanded the
millionaire yacht owner, indignantly.

"Well, it's true," stubbornly insisted the scientist.

"What if it is? It doesn't do any good to remind us of it."

"Bless my gizzard, no!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Suppose we have
dinner. I'm hungry."

That seemed to be his remedy for a number of ills.

"If we only could get a message off, summoning help, it WOULD be the
very thing," sighed Mrs. Nestor. "Oh, how I wish I could send my
daughter, Mary, word of where we are. She may hear of the wreck of
the RESOLUTE, and worry herself to death."

"But it is out of the question to send a message for help from
Earthquake Island," added Mrs. Anderson. "We are totally cut off
from the rest of the world here."

"Perhaps not," spoke Tom Swift, quietly. He had come up silently,
and had heard the conversation.

"What's that you said?" cried Mr. Nestor, springing to his feet, and
crossing the sandy beach toward the lad.

"I said perhaps we weren't altogether cut off from the rest of the
world," repeated Tom.

"Why not," demanded Captain Mentor. "You don't mean to say that you
have been building a boat up there in your little shack, do you?"

"Not a boat," replied Tom, "but I think I have a means of sending
out a call for help!"

"Oh, Tom--Mr. Swift--how?" exclaimed Mrs. Nestor. "Do you mean we
can send a message to my Mary?"

"Well, not exactly to her," answered the young inventor, though he
wished that such a thing were possible. "But I think I can summon
help."

"How?" demanded Mr. Hosbrook. "Have you managed to discover some
cable line running past the island, and have you tapped it?"

"Not exactly." was Tom's calm answer, "but I have succeeded, with
the help of Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick, in building an apparatus that
will send out wireless messages!"

"Wireless messages!" gasped the millionaire. "Are you sure?"

"Wireless messages!" exclaimed Mr. Jenks. "I'll give--" He paused,
clasped his hands on his belt, and turned away.

"Oh, Tom!" cried Mrs. Nestor, and she went up to the lad, threw her
arms about his neck, and kissed him; whereat Tom blushed.

"Perhaps you'd better explain," suggested Mr. Anderson.

"I will," said the lad. "That is the secret we have been engaged
upon--Mr. Damon, Mr. Fenwick and myself. We did not want to say
anything about it until we were sure we could succeed."

"And are you sure now?" asked Captain Mentor.

"Fairly so."

"How could you build a wireless station?" inquired Mr. Hosbrook.

"From the electrical machinery that was in the wrecked WHIZZER,"
spoke Tom. "Fortunately, that was not damaged by the shock of the
fall, and I have managed to set up the gasolene engine, and attach
the dynamo to it so that we can generate a powerful current. We also
have a fairly good storage battery, though that was slightly damaged
by the fall."

"I have just tested the machinery, and I think we can send out a
strong enough message to carry at least a thousand miles."

"Then that will reach some station, or some passing ship," murmured
Captain Mentor. "There is a chance that we may be saved."

"If it isn't too late," gloomily murmured the scientist. "There is
no telling when the island will disappear beneath the sea."

But they were all so interested in Tom's announcement that they paid
little attention to this dire foreboding.

"Tell us about it," suggested Mr. Nestor. And Tom did.

He related how he had set up the dynamo and gasolene engine, and
how, by means of the proper coils and other electrical apparatus,
all of which, fortunately, was aboard the WHIZZER, he could produce
a powerful spark.

"I had to make a key out of strips of brass, to produce the Morse
characters," the lad said. "This took considerable time, but it
works, though it is rather crude. I can click out a message with
it."

"That may be," said Mr. Hosbrook, who had been considering
installing a wireless plant on his yacht, and who, therefore, knew
something about it, "you may send a message, but can you receive an
answer?"

"I have also provided for that," replied Tom. "I have made a
receiving instrument, though that is even more crude than the
sending plant, for it had to be delicately adjusted, and I did not
have just the magnets, carbons, coherers and needles that I needed.
But I think it will work."

"Did you have a telephone receiver to use?"

"Yes. There was a small interior telephone arrangement on Mr.
Fenwick's airship, and part of that came in handy. Oh, I think I can
hear any messages that may come in answer to ours."

"But what about the aerial wires for sending and receiving
messages?" asked Mr. Nestor.

"Don't you have to have several wires on a tall mast?"

"Yes, and that is the last thing to do," declared Tom. "I need all
your help in putting up those wires. That tall tree on the crest of
the island will do," and he pointed to a dead palm that towered
gaunt and bare like a ship's mast, on a pile of rocks in the centre
of Earthquake Island.




CHAPTER XXI

MESSAGES INTO SPACE


Tom Swift's announcement of the practical completion of his wireless
plant brought hope to the discouraged hearts of the castaways. They
crowded about him, and asked all manner of questions.

Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Damon came in for their share of attention, for
Tom said had it not been for the aid of his friends he never could
have accomplished what he did. Then they all trooped up to the
little shack, and inspected the plant.

As the young inventor had said, it was necessarily crude, but when
he set the gasolene motor going, and the dynamo whizzed and hummed,
sending out great, violet-hued sparks, they were all convinced that
the young inventor had accomplished wonders, considering the
materials at his disposal.

"But it's going to be no easy task to rig up the sending and
receiving wires," declared Tom. "That will take some time."

"Have you got the wire?" asked Mr. Jenks.

"I took it from the stays of the airship," was Tom's reply, and he
recalled the day he was at that work, when the odd man had exhibited
the handful of what he said were diamonds. Tom wondered if they
really were, and he speculated as to what might be the secret of
Phantom Mountain, to which Mr. Jenks had referred.

But now followed a busy time for all. Under the direction of the
young inventor, they began to string the wires from the top of the
dead tree, to a smaller one, some distance away, using five wires,
set parallel, and attached to a wooden spreader, or stay. The wires
were then run to the dynamo, and the receiving coil, and the
necessary ground wires were installed.

"But I can't understand how you are going to do it," said Mrs.
Nestor. "I've read about wireless messages, but I can't get it
through my head. How is it done, Mr. Swift?"

"The theory is very simple," said the young inventor. "To send a
message by wire, over a telegraph system, a battery or dynamo is
used. This establishes a current over wires stretched between two
points. By means of what is called a 'key' this current is
interrupted, or broken, at certain intervals, making the sounding
instrument send out clicks. A short click is called a dot, and a
long click a dash. By combinations of dots, dashes, and spaces
between the dots and dashes, letters are spelled out. For instance,
a dot and a space and a dash, represent the letter 'A' and so on."

"I understand so far," admitted Mrs. Nestor.

"In telegraphing without wires," went on Tom, "the air is used in
place of a metallic conductor, with the help of the earth, which in
itself is a big magnet, or a battery, as you choose to regard it.
The earth helps to establish the connection between places where
there are no wires, when we 'ground' certain conductors."

"To send a wireless message a current is generated by a dynamo. The
current flows along until it gets to the ends of the sending wires,
which we have just strung. Then it leaps off into space, so to
speak, until it reaches the receiving wires, wherever they may be
erected. That is why any wireless receiving station, within a
certain radius, can catch any messages that may be flying through
the air--that is unless certain apparatus is tuned, or adjusted, to
prevent this."

"Well, once the impulses, or electric currents, are sent out into
space, all that is necessary to do is to break, or interrupt them at
certain intervals, to make dots, dashes and spaces. These make
corresponding clicks in the telephone receiver which the operator at
the receiving station wears on his ear. He hears the code of clicks,
and translates them into letters, the letters into words and the
words into sentences. That is how wireless messages are sent."

"And do you propose to send some that way?" asked Mrs. Anderson.

"I do," replied Tom, with a smile.

"Where to?" Mrs. Nestor wanted to know.

"That's what I can't tell," was Tom's reply. "I will have to project
them off into space, and trust to chance that some listening
wireless operator will 'pick them up,' as they call it, and send us
aid."

"But are wireless operators always listening?" asked Mr. Nestor.

"Somewhere, some of them are--I hope," was Tom's quiet answer. "As I
said, we will have to trust much to chance. But other people have
been saved by sending messages off into space; and why not we?
Sinking steamers have had their passengers taken off when the
operator called for help, merely by sending a message into space."

"But how can we tell them where to come for us--on this unknown
island?" inquired Mrs. Anderson.

"I fancy Captain Mentor can supply our longitude and latitude,"
answered Tom. "I will give that with every message I send out, and
help may come--some day."

"It can't come any too quick for me!" declared Mr. Damon. "Bless my
door knob, but my wife must be worrying about my absence!"

"What message for help will you send?" Captain Mentor wanted to
know.

"I am going to use the old call for aid," was the reply of the young
inventor. "I shall flash into space the three letters 'C.Q.D.' They
stand for 'Come Quick--Danger.' A new code call has been instituted
for them, but I am going to rely on the old one, as, in this part of
the world, the new one may not be so well understood. Then I will
follow that by giving our position in the ocean, as nearly as
Captain Mentor can figure it out. I will repeat this call at
intervals until we get help--"

"Or until the island sinks," added the scientist, grimly.

"Here! Don't mention that any more," ordered Mr. Hosbrook. "It's
getting on my nerves! We may be rescued before that awful calamity
overtakes us."

"I don't believe so," was Mr. Parker's reply, and he actually seemed
to derive pleasure from his gloomy prophecy.

"It's lucky you understand wireless telegraphy, Tom Swift," said Mr.
Nestor admiringly, and the other joined in praising the young
inventor, until, blushing, he hurried off to make some adjustments
to his apparatus.

"Can you compute our longitude and latitude, Captain Mentor," asked
the millionaire yacht owner.

"I think so," was the reply. "Not very accurately, of course, for
all my papers and instruments went down in the RESOLUTE. But near
enough for the purpose, I fancy. I'll get right to work at it, and
let Mr. Swift have it."

"I wish you would. The sooner we begin calling for help the better.
I never expected to be in such a predicament as this, but it is
wonderful how that young fellow worked out his plan of rescue. I
hope he succeeds."

It took some little time for the commander to figure their position,
and then it was only approximate. But at length he handed Tom a
piece of paper with the latitude and longitude written on it.

In the meanwhile, the young inventor had been connecting up his
apparatus. The wires were now all strung, and all that was necessary
was to start the motor and dynamo.

A curious throng gathered about the little shack as Tom announced
that he was about to flash into space the first message calling for
help. He took his place at the box, to which had been fastened the
apparatus for clicking off the Morse letters.

"Well, here we go," he said, with a smile.

His fingers clasped the rude key he had fashioned from bits of brass
and hard rubber. The motor was buzzing away, and the electric dynamo
was purring like some big cat.

Just as Tom opened the circuit, to send the current into the
instrument, there came an ominous rumbling of the earth.

"Another quake!" screamed Mrs. Anderson. But it was over in a
second, and calmness succeeded the incipient panic.

Suddenly, overhead, there sounded a queer crackling noise, a
vicious, snapping, as if from some invisible whips.

"Mercy! What's that?" cried Mrs. Nestor.

"The wireless," replied Tom, quietly. "I am going to send a message
for help, off into space. I hope some one receives it--and answers,"
he added, in a low tone.

The crackling increased. While they gathered about him, Tom Swift
pressed the key, making and breaking the current until he had sent
out from Earthquake Island the three letters--"C.Q.D." And he
followed them by giving their latitude and longitude. Over and over
again he flashed out this message.

Would it be answered? Would help come? If so, from where? And if so,
would it be in time? These were questions that the castaways asked
themselves. As for Tom, he sat at the key, clicking away, while,
overhead, from the wires fastened to the dead tree, flashed out the
messages.




CHAPTER XXII

ANXIOUS DAYS


After the first few minutes of watching Tom click out the messages,
the little throng of castaways that had gathered about the shack,
moved away. The matter had lost its novelty for them, though, of
course, they were vitally interested in the success of Tom's
undertaking. Only Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick remained with the young
inventor, for he needed help, occasionally, in operating the dynamo,
or in adjusting the gasolene motor. Mrs. Nestor, who, with Mrs.
Anderson, was looking after the primitive housekeeping arrangements,
occasionally strolled up the hill to the little shed.

"Any answer yet, Mr. Swift?" she would ask.

"No." was the reply. "We can hardly expect any so soon," and Mrs.
Nestor would depart, with a sigh.

Knowing that his supply of gasolene was limited, Tom realized that
he could not run the dynamo steadily, and keep flashing the wireless
messages into space. He consulted with his two friends on the
subject, and Mr. Damon said:

"Well, the best plan, I think, would be only to send out the flashes
over the wires at times when other wireless operators will be on the
lookout, or, rather, listening. There is no use wasting our fuel. We
can't get any more here."

"That's true," admitted Tom, "but how can we pick out any certain
time, when we can be sure that wireless operators, within a zone of
a thousand miles, will be listening to catch clicks which call for
help from the unknown?"

"We can't," decided Mr. Fenwick. "The only thing to do is to trust
to chance. If there was only some way so you would not have to be on
duty all the while, and could send out messages automatically, it
would be good."

Tom shook his head. "I have to stay here to adjust the apparatus,"
he said. "It works none too easily as it is, for I didn't have just
what I needed from which to construct this station. Anyhow, even if
I could rig up something to click out 'C.Q.D.' automatically, I
could hardly arrange to have the answer come that way. And I want to
be here when the answer comes."

"Have you any plan, then?" asked Mr. Damon. "Bless my shoe laces!
there are enough problems to solve on this earthquake island."

"I thought of this," said Tom. "I'll send out our call for help from
nine to ten in the morning. Then I'll wait, and send out another
call from two to three in the afternoon. Around seven in the evening
I'll try again, and then about ten o'clock at night, before going to
bed."

"That ought to be sufficient," agreed Mr. Fenwick. "Certainly we
must save our gasolene, for there is no telling how long we may have
to stay here, and call for help."

"It won't be long if that scientist Parker has his way," spoke Mr.
Damon, grimly. "Bless my hat band, but he's a MOST uncomfortable man
to have around; always predicting that the island is going to sink!
I hope we are rescued before that happens."

"I guess we all do," remarked Mr. Fenwick. "But, Tom, here is
another matter. Have you thought about getting an answer from the
unknown--from some ship or wireless station, that may reply to your
calls? How can you tell when that will come in?"

"I can't."

"Then won't you or some of us, have to be listening all the while?"

"No, for I think an answer will come only directly after I have sent
out a call, and it has been picked up by some operator. Still there
is a possibility that some operator might receive my message, and
report to his chief, or some one in authority over him, before
replying. In that time I might go away. But to guard against that I
will sleep with the telephone receiver clamped to my ear. Then I can
hear the answer come over the wires, and can jump up and reply."

"Do you mean you will sleep here?" asked Mr. Damon, indicating the
shack where the wireless apparatus was contained.

"Yes," answered Tom, simply.

"Can't we take turns listening for the answer?" inquired Mr.
Fenwick, "and so relieve you?"

"I'm afraid not, unless you understand the Morse code," replied Tom.
"You see there may be many clicks, which result from wireless
messages flying back and forth in space, and my receiver will pick
them up. But they will mean nothing. Only the answer to our call for
help will be of any service to us."

"Do you mean to say that you can catch messages flying back and
forth between stations now?" asked Mr. Fenwick.

"Yes," replied the young inventor, with a smile. "Here, listen for
yourself," and he passed the head-instrument over to the WHIZZER's
former owner. The latter listened a moment.

"All I can hear are some faint clicks," he said.

"But they are a message," spoke Tom. "Wait, I'll translate," and he
put the receiver to his ear. "'STEAMSHIP "FALCON" REPORTS A SLIGHT
FIRE IN HER FORWARD COMPARTMENT,'" said Tom, slowly. "'IT IS UNDER
CONTROL, AND WE WILL PROCEED.'"

"Do you mean to say that was the message you heard?" cried Mr.
Damon. "Bless my soul, I never can understand it!"

"It was part of a message," answered Tom. "I did not catch it all,
nor to whom it was sent."

"But why can't you send a message to that steamship then, and beg
them to come to our aid?" asked Mr. Fenwick. "Even if they have had
a fire, it is out now, and they ought to be glad to save life."

"They would come to our aid, or send," spoke Tom, "but I can not
make their wireless operator pick up our message. Either his
apparatus is not in tune, or in accord with ours, or he is beyond
our zone."

"But you heard him," insisted Mr. Damon.

"Yes, but sometimes it is easier to pick up messages than it is to
send them. However, I will keep on trying."

Putting into operation the plan he had decided on for saving their
supply of gasolene, Tom sent out his messages the remainder of the
day, at the intervals agreed upon. Then the apparatus was shut down,
but the lad paid frequent visits to the shack, and listened to the
clicks of the telephone receiver. He caught several messages, but
they were not in response to his appeals for aid.

That night there was a slight earthquake shock, but no more of the
island fell into the sea, though the castaways were awakened by the
tremors, and were in mortal terror for a while.

Three days passed, days of anxious waiting, during which time Tom
sent out message after message by his wireless, and waited in vain
for an answer. There were three shocks in this interval, two slight,
and one very severe, which last cast into the ocean a great cliff on
the far end of the island. There was a flooding rush of water, but
no harm resulted.

"It is coming nearer," said Mr. Parker.

"What is?" demanded Mr. Hosbrook.

"The destruction of our island. My theory will soon be confirmed,"
and the scientist actually seemed to take pleasure in it.

"Oh, you and your theory!" exclaimed the millionaire in disgust.
"Don't let me hear you mention it again! Haven't we troubles
enough?" whereat Mr. Parker went off by himself, to look at the
place where the cliff had fallen.

Each night Tom slept with the telephone receiver to his ear, but,
though it clicked many times, there was not sounded the call he had
adopted for his station--"E. I."--Earthquake Island. In each appeal
he sent out he had requested that if his message was picked up, that
the answer be preceded by the letters "E.I."

It was on the fourth day after the completion of the wireless
station, that Tom was sending out his morning calls. Mrs. Nestor
came up the little hill to the shack where Tom was clicking away.

"No replies yet, I suppose?" she inquired, and there was a hopeless
note in her voice.

"None yet, but they may come any minute," and Tom tried to speak
cheerfully.

"I certainly hope so," added Mary's mother, "But I came up more
especially now, Mr. Swift, to inquire where you had stored the rest
of the food."

"The rest of the food?"

"Yes, the supply you took from the wrecked airship. We have used up
nearly all that was piled in the improvised kitchen, and we'll have
to draw on the reserve supply."

"The reserve," murmured Tom.

"Yes, there is only enough in the shack where Mrs. Anderson and I do
the cooking, to last for about two days. Isn't there any more?"

Tom did not answer. He saw the drift of the questioning. Their food
was nearly gone, yet the castaways from the RESOLUTE thought there
was still plenty. As a matter of fact there was not another can,
except those in the kitchen shack.

"Get out wherever there is left some time to-day, if you will, Mr.
Swift," went on Mrs. Nestor, as she turned away, "and Mrs. Anderson
and I will see if we can fix up some new dishes for you men-folks."

"Oh--all right," answered Tom, weakly.

His hand dropped from the key of the instrument. He sat staring into
space. Food enough for but two days more, with earthquakes likely to
happen at any moment, and no reply yet to his appeals for aid! Truly
the situation was desperate. Tom shook his head. It was the first
time he had felt like giving up.




CHAPTER XXIII

A REPLY IN THE DARK


The young inventor looked out of the wireless shack. Down on the
beach he saw the little band of castaways. They were gathered in a
group about Mr. Jenks, who seemed to be talking earnestly to them.
The two ladies were over near the small building that served as a
kitchen.

"More food supplies needed, eh?" mused Tom. "Well, I don't know
where any more is to come from. We've stripped the WHIZZER bare." He
glanced toward what remained of the airship. "I guess we'll have to
go on short rations, until help comes," and, wondering what the
group of men could be talking about, Tom resumed his clicking out of
his wireless message.

He continued to send it into space for several minutes after ten
o'clock, the hour at which he usually stopped for the morning, for
he thought there might be a possible chance that the electrical
impulses would be picked up by some vessel far out at sea, or by
some station operator who could send help.

But there came no answering clicks to the "E. I." station--to
Earthquake Island--and, after a little longer working of the key,
Tom shut down the dynamo, and joined the group on the beach.

"I tell you it's our only chance," Mr. Jenks was saying. "I must get
off this island, and that's the only way we can do it. I have large
interests at stake. If we wait for a reply to this wireless message
we may all be killed, though I appreciate that Mr. Swift is doing
his best to aid us. But it is hopeless!"

"What do you think about it, Tom?" asked Mr. Damon, turning to the
young inventor.

"Think about what?"

"Why Mr. Jenks has just proposed that we build a big raft, and
launch it. He thinks we should leave the island."

"It might be a good idea," agreed the lad, as he thought of the
scant food supply. "Of course, I can't say when a reply will be
received to my calls for aid, and it is best to be prepared."

"Especially as the island may sink any minute," added Mr. Parker.
"If it does, even a raft will be little good, as it may be swamped
in the vortex. I think it would be a good plan to make one, then
anchor it some distance out from the island. Then we can make a
small raft, and paddle out to the big one in a hurry if need be."

"Yes, that's a good idea, too," conceded Tom.

"And we must stock it well with provisions," said Mr. Damon. "Put
plenty of water and food aboard."

"We can't," spoke Tom, quietly.

"Why not?"

"Because we haven't plenty of provisions. That's what I came down to
speak about," and the lad related what Mrs. Nestor had said.

"Then there is but one thing to do," declared Mr. Fenwick.

"What?" asked Captain Mentor.

"We must go on half rations, or quarter rations, if need be. That
will make our supply last longer. And another thing--we must not let
the women folks know. Just pretend that we're not hungry, but take
only a quarter, or at most, not more than a half of what we have
been in the habit of taking. There is plenty of water, thank
goodness, and we may be able to live until help comes."

"Then shall we build the raft?" asked Mr. Hosbrook.

It was decided that this would be a good plan, and they started it
that same day. Trees were felled, with axes and saws that had been
aboard the WHIZZER, and bound together, in rude fashion, with strong
trailing vines from the forest. A smaller raft, as a sort of ferry,
was also made.

This occupied them all that day, and part of the next. In the
meanwhile, Tom continued to flash out his appeals for help, but no
answers came. The men cut down their rations, and when the two
ladies joked them on their lack of appetite, they said nothing. Tom
was glad that Mrs. Nestor did not renew her request to him to get
out the reserve food supply from what remained in the wreck of the
airship. Perhaps Mr. Nestor had hinted to her the real situation.

The large raft was towed out into a quiet bay of the island, and
anchored there by means of a heavy rock, attached to a rope. On
board were put cans of water, which were lashed fast, but no food
could be spared to stock the rude craft. All the castaways could
depend on, was to take with them, in the event of the island
beginning to sink, what rations they had left when the final shock
should come.

This done, they could only wait, and weary was that waiting. Tom
kept faithfully to his schedule, and his ear ached from the constant
pressure of the telephone receiver. He heard message after message
flash through space, and click on his instrument, but none of them
was in answer to his. On his face there came a grim and hopeless
look.

One afternoon, a week following the erection of the wireless
station, Mate Fordam came upon a number of turtles. He caught some,
by turning them over on their backs, and also located a number of
nests of eggs under the warm sands.

"This will be something to eat," he said, joyfully, and indeed the
turtles formed a welcome food supply. Some fish were caught, and
some clams were cast up by the tide, all of which eked out the
scanty food supply that remained. The two ladies suspected the truth
now and they, too, cut down their allowance.

Tom, who had been sitting with the men in their sleeping shack, that
evening, rose, as the hour of ten approached. It was time to send
out the last message of the night, and then he would lie down on an
improvised couch, with the telephone receiver clamped to his ear, to
wait, in the silence of the darkness, for the message saying that
help was on the way.

"Well, are you off?" asked Mr. Damon, kindly. "I wish some of us
could relieve you, Tom."

"Oh, I don't mind it," answered the lad "Perhaps the message may
come to-night."

Hardly had he spoken than there sounded the ominous rumble and
shaking that presaged another earthquake. The shack rocked, and
threatened to come down about their heads.

"We must be doomed!" cried Mr. Parker. "The island is about to sink!
Make for the raft!"

"Wait and see how bad it is," counseled Mr. Hosbrook. "It may be
only a slight shock."

Indeed, as he spoke, the trembling of the island ceased, and there
was silence. The two ladies, who had retired to their own private
shack, ran out screaming, and Mr. Anderson and Mr. Nestor hastened
over to be with their wives.

"I guess it's passed over," spoke Mr. Fenwick.

An instant later there came another tremor, but it was not like that
of an earthquake shock. It was more like the rumble and vibration of
an approaching train.

"Look!" cried Tom, pointing to the left. Their gaze went in that
direction, and, under the light of a full moon they saw, sliding
into the sea, a great portion of one of the rocky hills.

"A landslide!" cried Captain Mentor. "The island is slowly breaking
up."

"It confirms my theory!" said Mr. Parker, almost in triumph.

"Forget your theory for a while, Parker, please," begged Mr.
Hosbrook. "We're lucky to have left a place on which to stand! Oh,
when will we be rescued?" he asked hopelessly.

The worst seemed to be over at least for the present, and, learning
that the two ladies were quieted, Tom started up the hill to his
wireless station. Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick went with him, to aid in
starting the motor and dynamo. Then, after the message had been
clicked out as usual Tom would begin his weary waiting.

They found that the earthquake shock had slightly disturbed the
apparatus, and it took them half an hour to adjust it. As there had
been a delay on account of the landslide, it was eleven o'clock
before Tom began sending out any flashes, and he kept it up until
midnight. But there came no replies, so he shut off the power, and
prepared to get a little rest.

"It looks pretty hopeless; doesn't it?" said Mr. Fenwick, as he and
Mr. Damon were on their way back to the sleeping shack.

"Yes, it does. Our signal hasn't been seen, no ships have passed
this way, and our wireless appeal isn't answered. It does look
hopeless but, do you know, I haven't given up yet."

"Why not?"

"Because I have faith in Tom Swift's luck!" declared the eccentric
man. "If you had been with him as much as I have, up in the air, and
under the water, and had seen the tight places he has gotten out of,
you'd feel the same, too!"

"Perhaps, but here there doesn't seem to be anything to do. It all
depends on some one else."

"That's all right. You leave it to Tom. He'll get an answer yet, you
see if he doesn't."

 It was an hour past midnight. Tom tossed uneasily on the hard bed
in the wireless shack. The telephone receiver on his ear hurt him,
and he could not sleep.

"I may as well sit up for a while," he told himself, and he arose.
In the dimness of the shack he could see the outlines of the dynamo
and the motor.

"Guess I'll start her up, and send out some calls," he murmured. "I
might just happen to catch some ship operator who is up late. I'll
try it."

The young inventor started the motor, and soon the dynamo was
purring away. He tested the wireless apparatus. It shot out great
long sparks, which snapped viciously through the air. Then, in the
silence of the night, Tom clicked off his call for help for the
castaways of Earthquake Island.

For half an hour he sent it away into space, none of the others in
their shacks below him, awakening. Then Tom, having worked off his
restless fit, was about to return to bed.

But what was this? What was that clicking in the telephone receiver
at his ear? He listened. It was not a jumble of dots and dashes,
conveying through space a message that meant nothing to him. No! It
was his own call that was answered. The call of his station--"E.
I."--Earthquake Island!

"WHERE ARE YOU? WHAT'S WANTED?"

That was the message that was clicked to Tom from somewhere in the
great void.

"I GET YOUR MESSAGE 'E. I.' WHAT'S WANTED? DO I HEAR YOU RIGHT?
REPEAT." Tom heard those questions in the silence of the night.

With trembling fingers Tom pressed his own key. Out into the
darkness went his call for help.

"WE ARE ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND." He gave the longitude and latitude.
"COME QUICKLY OR WE WILL BE ENGULFED IN THE SEA! WE ARE CASTAWAYS
FROM THE YACHT 'RESOLUTE,' AND THE AIRSHIP 'WHIZZER.' CAN YOU SAVE
US?"

Came then this query:

"WHAT'S THAT ABOUT AIRSHIP?"

"NEVER MIND AIRSHIP," clicked Tom. "SEND HELP QUICKLY! WHO ARE YOU?"

The answer flashed to him through space:

"STEAMSHIP 'CAMBARANIAN' FROM RIO DE JANEIRO TO NEW YORK. JUST
CAUGHT YOUR MESSAGE. THOUGHT IT A FAKE."

"NO FAKE," Tom sent back. "HELP US QUICKLY! HOW SOON CAN YOU COME?"

There was a wait, and the wireless operator clicked to Tom that he
had called the captain. Then came the report:

"WE WILL BE THERE WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS. KEEP IN COMMUNICATION
WITH US."

"YOU BET I WILL," flashed back Tom, his heart beating joyously, and
then he let out a great shout. "We are saved! We are saved! My
wireless message is answered! A steamer is on her way to rescue us!"

He rushed from the shack, calling to the others.

"What's that?" demanded Mr. Hosbrook.

Tom briefly told of how the message had come to him in the night.

"Tell them to hurry," begged the rich yacht owner. "Say that I will
give twenty thousand dollars reward if we are taken off!"

"And I'll do the same," cried Mr. Jenks. "I must get to the place
where--" Then he seemed to recollect himself, and stopped suddenly.
"Tell them to hurry," he begged Tom. The whole crowd of castaways,
save the women, were gathered about the wireless shack.

"They'll need to hurry," spoke Mr. Parker, the gloomy scientist.
"The island may sink before morning!"

Mr. Hosbrook and the others glared at him, but he seemed to take
delight in his prediction.

Suddenly the wireless instruments hummed.

"Another message," whispered Tom. He listened.

"THE 'CAMBARANIAN' WILL RUSH HERE WITH ALL SPEED," he announced, and
not a heart there on that lonely and desolate island but sent up a
prayer of thankfulness.




CHAPTER XXIV

"WE ARE LOST!"


There was little more sleep for any one that night. They sat up,
talking over the wonderful and unexpected outcome of Tom Swift's
wireless message, and speculating as to when the steamer would get
there.

"Bless my pocket comb! But I told you it would come out all right,
if we left it to Tom!" declared Mr. Damon.

"But it hasn't come out yet," remarked the pessimistic scientist.
"The steamer may arrive too late."

"You're a cheerful sort of fellow to take on a yachting trip,"
murmured Mr. Hosbrook, sarcastically. "I'll never invite you again,
even if you are a great scientist."

"I'm going to sit and watch for the steamer," declared Mr. Damon, as
he went outside the shack. The night was warm, and there was a full
moon. "Which way will she come from, Tom?"

"I don't know, but I should think, that if she was on her way north,
from South America, she'd pass on the side of the island on which we
now are."

"That's right," agreed Captain Mentor. "She'll come up from over
there," and he pointed across the ocean directly in front of the
shacks and camp.

"Then I'm going to see if I can't be the first to sight her lights,"
declared Mr. Damon.

"She can't possibly get here inside of a day, according to what the
operator said," declared Tom.

"Wire them to put on all the speed they can," urged the eccentric
man.

"No, don't waste any more power or energy than is needed," suggested
Mr. Hosbrook. "You may need the gasolene before we are rescued. They
are on their way, and that is enough for now."

The others agreed with this, and so Tom, after a final message to
the operator aboard the CAMBARANIAN stating that he would call him
up in the morning, shut down the motor.

Mr. Damon took up his position where he could see far out over the
ocean, but, as the young inventor had said, there was no possible
chance of sighting the relief steamer inside of a day. Still the
nervous, eccentric man declared that he would keep watch.

Morning came, and castaways brought to breakfast a better appetite
than they had had in some time. They were allowed larger rations,
too, for it was seen that they would have just enough food to last
until taken off.

"We didn't need to have made the big raft," said Mr. Fenwick, as Tom
came down from his station, to report that he had been in
communication with the Camabarian and that she was proceeding under
forced draught. "We'll not have to embark on it, and I'm glad of
it."

"Oh, we may need it yet," asserted Mr. Parker. "I have been making
some observations just now, and the island is in a very precarious
state. It is, I believe, resting on only a slim foundation, and the
least shock may break that off, and send it into the sea. That is
what my observations point out."

"Then I wish you wouldn't make any more observations!" exclaimed
Mrs. Nestor, with spirit. "You make me nervous."

"And me, also," added Mrs. Anderson.

"Science can not deceive, madam," retorted Mr. Parker.

"Well it can keep quiet about what it knows, and not make a person
have cold chills," replied Mary's mother. "I'm sure we will be
rescued in time."

There was a slight tremor of an earthquake, as they were eating
dinner that day, but, aside from causing a little alarm it did no
damage. In the afternoon, Tom again called up the approaching
steamer, and was informed that, because of a slight accident, it
could not arrive until the next morning. Every effort would be made
to keep up speed, it was said. There was much disappointment over
this, and Mr. Damon was observed to be closely examining the food
supply, but hope was too strong to be easily shattered now.

Mr. Parker went off alone, to make some further "observations" as he
called them, but Mr. Hosbrook warned him never again to speak of his
alarming theories.

Mr. Barcoe Jenks called Tom aside just before supper that evening.

"I haven't forgotten what I said to you about my diamonds," he
remarked, with many nods and winks. "I'll show you how to make them,
if you will help me. Did you ever see diamonds made?"

"No, and I guess very few persons have." replied the lad, thinking
perhaps Mr. Jenks might not be quite right, mentally.

The night passed without alarm, and in the morning, at the first
blush of dawn, every one was astir, looking eagerly across the sea
for a sight of the steamer.

Tom had just come down from the wireless station, having received a
message to the effect that a few hours more would bring the
CAMBARANIAN within sight of the island.

Suddenly there was a tremendous shock, as if some great cannon had
been fired, and the whole island shook to its very centre.

"Another earthquake! The worst yet!" screamed Mrs. Anderson.

"We are lost!" cried Mrs. Nestor, clinging to her husband.

An instant later they were all thrown down by the tremor of the
earth, and Tom, looking toward his wireless station, saw nearly half
of the island disappear from sight. His station went down in
collapse with it, splashing into the ocean, and the wave that
followed the terrible crash washed nearly to the castaways, as they
rose and kneeled on the sand.

"The island is sinking!" cried Mr. Parker. "Make for the raft!"

"I guess it's our only chance," murmured Captain Mentor, as he gazed
across the water. There was no steamer in sight. Could it arrive on
time? The tremors and shaking of the island continued.




CHAPTER XXV

THE RESCUE--CONCLUSION


Down to where the small raft was moored ran Mr. Parker. He was
followed by some of the others.

"We must put off at once!" he cried. "Half the island is gone! The
other half may disappear any moment! The steamer can not get here on
time, but if we put off they may pick us up, if we are not engulfed
in the ocean. Help, everybody!"

Tom gave one more look at where his wireless station had been. It
had totally disappeared, there being, at the spot, now but a sheer
cliff, which went right down into the sea.

The women were in tears. The men, with pale faces, tried to calm
them. Gradually the earthquake tremor passed away; but who could
tell when another would come?

Captain Mentor, Mr. Hosbrook and the others were shoving out the
small raft. They intended to get aboard, and paddle out to the
larger one, which had been moored some distance away, in readiness
for some such emergency as this.

"Come on!" cried Mr. Fenwick to Tom who was lingering behind. "Come
on, ladies. We must all get aboard, or it may be too late!"

The small raft was afloat. Mrs. Anderson and Mrs. Nestor, weeping
hysterically, waded out through the water to get aboard.

"Have we food?" cried Mr. Damon. "Bless my kitchen range! but I
nearly forgot that."

"There isn't any food left to take," answered Mrs. Anderson.

"Shove off!" cried Captain Mentor.

At that instant a haze which had hung over the water, was blown to
one side. The horizon suddenly cleared. Tom Swift looked up and gave
a cry.

"The steamer! The steamer! The CAMBARANIAN!" he shouted, pointing to
it.

The others joined in his exclamations of joy, for there, rushing
toward Earthquake Island was a great steamer, crowding on all speed!

"Saved! Saved!" cried Mrs. Nestor, sinking to her knees even in the
water.

"It came just in time!" murmured Mr. Hosbrook.

"Now I can make my diamonds," whispered Mr. Jenks to Tom.

"Push off! Push off!" cried Mr. Parker. "The island will sink,
soon!"

"I think we will be safer on the island than on the raft," declared
Captain Mentor. "We had better land again."

They left the little raft, and stood on the shore of the island.
Eagerly they watched the approach of the steamer. They could make
out hands and handkerchiefs waving to them now. There was eager hope
in every heart.

Suddenly, some distance out in the water, and near where the big
raft was anchored, there was a curious upheaval of the ocean. It was
as if a submarine mine had exploded! The sea swirled and foamed!

"It's a good thing we didn't go out there," observed Captain Mentor.
"We would have been swamped, sure as guns."

Almost as he spoke the big raft was tossed high into the air, and
fell back, breaking up. The castaways shuddered. Yet were they any
safer on the island? They fancied they could feel the little part of
it that remained trembling under their feet.

"The steamer is stopping!" cried Mr. Damon.

Surely enough the CAMBARANIAN had slowed up. Was she not going to
complete the rescue she had begun?

"She's going to launch her lifeboats," declared Captain Mentor. "Her
commander dare not approach too close, not knowing the water. He
might hit on a rock."

A moment later and two lifeboats were lowered, and, urged on by the
sturdy arms of the sailors, they bounded over the waves. The sea
seemed to be more and more agitated.

"It is the beginning of the end," murmured Mr. Parker. "The island
will soon disappear."

"Will you be quiet?" demanded Mr. Damon, giving the scientist a
nudge in the ribs.

The lifeboats were close at hand now.

"Are you all there?" shouted some one, evidently in command.

"All here," answered Tom.

"Then hurry aboard. There seems to be something going on in these
waters--perhaps a submarine volcano eruption. We must get away in a
hurry!"

The boats came in to the shelving beach. There was a little stretch
of water between them and the sand. Through this the castaways
waded, and soon they were grasped by the sailors and helped in. In
the reaction of their worriment Mrs. Anderson and Mrs. Nestor were
both weeping, but their tears were those of joy.

"Give way now, men!" cried the mate in charge of the boats. "We must
get back to the ship!"

The sea was now swirling angrily, but the sailors, who had been in
worse turmoils than this, rowed on steadily.

"We feared you would not get here in time," said Tom to the mate.

"We were under forced draught most of the way," was his answer.
"Your wireless message came just in time. An hour later and our
operator would have gone to bed."

The young inventor realized by what a narrow margin they had been
rescued.

"The island will soon sink," predicted Mr. Parker, as they reached
the steamer, and boarded her. Captain Valasquez, who was in command,
warmly welcomed the castaways.

"We will hear your story later," he said. "Just now I want to get
out of these dangerous waters."

He gave the order for full speed, and, as the CAMBARANIAN got under
way, Tom, and the others, standing on the deck, looked back at
Earthquake Island.

Suddenly there sounded a dull, rumbling report. The whole ocean
about the island seemed to upheave. There was a gigantic shower of
spray, a sound like an explosion, and when the waters subsided the
island had sunk from sight.

"I told you it would go," cried Mr. Parker, triumphantly, but the
horror of it all--the horror of the fate that would have been theirs
had they remained there an hour longer--held the castaways dumb. The
scientist's honor of having correctly predicted the destruction of
the island was an empty one.

The agitation of the sea rocked even the mighty CAMBARANIAN and, had
our friends been aboard the frail raft, they would surely have
perished in the sea. As it was, they were safe--saved by Tom Swift's
wireless message.

The steamer resumed her voyage, and the castaways told their story.
Captain Valasquez refused to receive the large amount of money Mr.
Hasbrook and Mr. Jenks would have paid him for the rescue, accepting
only a sum he figured that he had lost by the delay, which was not a
great deal. The castaways were given the best aboard the ship, and
their stories were listened to by the other passengers with bated
breath.

In due time they were landed in New York, and Mr. and Mrs. Nestor
accompanied Tom to Shopton. Mr. Damon, with many blessings also
accompanied them, going to his home in Waterfield. Later it was
learned that the other boats from the RESOLUTE had been picked up,
and the sailors and guests were all saved.

Of course, as soon as our friends had been rescued by the steamer,
the wireless operator aboard her, with whom Tom soon struck up an
acquaintance, sent messages to the relatives of the castaways,
apprising them of their safety.

And the joy of Mary Nestor, when she found that it was Tom who had
saved her parents, can well be imagined. As for our hero, well, he
was glad too--for Mary's sake.

"I won't forget my promise to you, Tom Swift," said Mr. Barcoe
Jenks, as he parted from the young inventor, and what the promise
was will be told in the next volume of this series, to be called:
"Tom Swift Among the Diamond Makers; or, The Secret of Phantom
Mountain." In that Tom is destined to have many more surprising
adventures, as is also Mr. Damon, who learned new ways to call down
blessings on himself and his possessions.

And now, for a time, we will take leave of the young inventor and
also of his many friends, who never ceased to wonder over Tom
Swift's skill with the wireless.

CHAPTER I--A SUSPICIOUS JEWELER


Well, Tom Swift, I don't believe you will make any mistake if you buy
that diamond, said the jeweler to a young man who was inspecting a tray
of pins, set with the sparkling stones. It is of the first water, and
without a flaw.

It certainly seems so, Mr. Track. I don't know much about diamonds, and
I'm depending on you. But this one looks to be all right.

Is it for yourself, Tom?

Er--no--that is, not exactly, and Tom Swift, the young inventor of
airships and submarines, blushed slightly.

Ah, I see. It's for your housekeeper, Mrs. Baggert. Well, I think she
would like a pin of this sort. True, it's rather expensive, but--

No, it isn't for Mrs. Baggert, Mr. Track, and Tom seemed a bit
embarrassed.

No? Well, then, Tom--of course it's none of my affair, except to
sell you a good stone, But if this brooch is for a young lady, I can't
recommend anything nicer. Do you think you will take this; or do you
prefer to look at some others?

Oh, I think this will do, Mr. Track. I guess I'll take--

Tom's words were interrupted by a sudden action on the part of the
jeweler. Mr. Track ran from behind the showcase and hastened toward the
front door.

Did you see him, Tom? he cried. I wonder which way he went?

Who? asked the lad, following the shopkeeper.

That man. He's been walking up and down in front of my place for the
last ten minutes--ever since you've been in here, in fact, and I don't
like his looks.

What did he do?

Nothing much, except to stare in here as if he was sizing my place up.

Sizing it up?

Yes. Getting the lay of the land, so he or some confederate could
commit a robbery, maybe.

A robbery? Do you think that man was a thief?

I don't know that he was, Tom, and yet a jeweler has to be always
on the watch, and that isn't a joke, either, Tom Swift. Swindlers and
thieves are always on the alert for a chance to rob a jewelry store, and
they work many games.

I didn't notice any particular man looking in here, said Tom, who
still held the diamond brooch in his hand.

Well I did, went on the jeweler. I happened to glance out of the
window when you were looking at the pins, and I saw his eyes staring in
here in a suspicious manner. He may have a confederate with him, and,
when you're gone, one may come in, and pretend to want to look at some
diamonds. Then, when I'm showing him some, the other man will enter,
engage my attention, and the first man will slip out with a diamond ring
or pin. It's often done.

You seem to have it all worked out, Mr. Track, observed the lad, with
a smile. How do you know but what I'm in with a gang of thieves, and
that I'm only pretending to want to buy a diamond pin?

Oh, I guess I haven't known you, Tom Swift, ever since you were
big enough to toddle, not to be sure about what you're up to. But I
certainly didn't like the looks of that man. However, let's forget about
him. He seems to have gone down the street, and, after all, perhaps I
was mistaken. Just wait until I show you a few more styles before you
decide. The young lady may like one of these, and the jeweler went to
another showcase and took out some more trays of brooches.

What makes you think she's a young lady, Mr. Track? asked the lad.

Oh, it's easy guessing, Tom. We jewelers are good readers of character.
I can size up a young fellow coming in here to buy an engagement or a
wedding ring, as soon as he enters the door. I suppose you'll soon be
in the market for one of those, Tom, if all the reports I hear about you
are true--you and a certain Mary Nestor.

I--er--I think I don't care for any of these pins, spoke Tom, quickly,
with a blush. I like the first lot best. I think I'll take the one I
had in my hand when that man alarmed you. Ha! That's odd! What did I do
with it?

Tom looked about on the showcase, and glanced down on the floor. He had
mislaid the brooch, but the jeweler, with a laugh, lifted it out of a
tray a moment later.

I saw you lay it down, he said. We jewelers have to be on the watch.
Here it is. I'll just put it in a box, and--

With an exclamation, Mr. Track gave a hasty glance toward his big show
window. Tom looked up, and saw a man's face peering in. At the sight of
it, he, too, uttered a cry of surprise.

The next instant the man outside knocked on the glass, apparently with
a piece of metal, making a sharp sound. As soon as he heard it, the
jeweler once more sprang from behind the showcase, and leaped for the
door crying:

There's the thief! He's trying to cut a hole through my show window and
reach in and get something! It's an old trick. I'll get the police! Tom,
you stay here on guard! and before the lad could utter a protest, the
jeweler had opened the door, and was speeding down the street in the
gathering darkness.

Tom stared about him in some bewilderment. He was left alone in charge
of a very valuable stock of jewelry, the owner of which was racing after
a supposed thief, crying:

Police! Help! Thieves! Stop him, somebody!

This is a queer go, mused Tom. I wonder who that man was? He looked
like somebody I know, and yet I can't seem to place his face. I
wonder if he was trying to rob the place? Maybe there's another one--a
confederate--around here.

This thought rather alarmed Tom, so he went to the door, and looked up
and down the street. He could see no suspicious characters, but in the
direction in which the jeweler was running there was a little throng of
people, following Mr. Track after the man who had knocked on the window.

I wish I was there, instead of here, mused the lad. Still I can't
leave, or a thief might come in. Perhaps that was the game, and one of
the gang is hanging around, hoping the store will be deserted, so he can
enter and take what he likes.

Tom had read of such cases, and he at once resolved that he would not
only remain in the jewelry shop, but that he would lock the door, which
he at once proceeded to do. Then he breathed easier.

The town of Shopton, in the outskirts of which Tom lived with his
father, and where the scene above narrated took place, was none too well
lighted at night, and the lad had his doubts about the jeweler catching
the oddly-acting man, especially as the latter had a good start.

But some one may head him off, reasoned Tom. Though if they do catch
him, I don't see what they can prove against him. Hello, here I am
carrying this diamond pin around. I might lose it. Guess I'll put it
back on the tray.

He replaced in the proper receptacle one of the pins he had been
examining when the excitement occurred.

I wonder if Mary will like that? he said, softly. I hope she does.
Perhaps it would be better if she could come here herself and pick out
one--

Tom's musing was suddenly interrupted by a sharp tattoo on the glass
door of the jewelry shop. With a start, he looked up, to see staring in
on him the face of the man who had been there before--the man of whom
the jeweler was even then in chase.

Why--why---- stammered Tom.

The man knocked again.

Tom--Tom Swift! he called. Don't you know me?

Know you--you? repeated the lad.

Yes--don't you remember Earthquake Island--how we were nearly killed
there--don't you remember Mr. Jenks?

Mr. Jenks?

Tom was so startled that he could only repeat words after the strange
man, who was talking to him from outside the glass door.

Yes, Mr. Jenks, was the reply. Mr. Barcoe Jenks, who makes diamonds.
I saw you in the store about to buy a diamond--I wanted to tell you not
to--I'll give you a better diamond than you can buy--I just arrived in
this place--I must have a private talk with you--Come out--I'll share a
wonderful secret with you.

A flood of memory came to Tom. He did recall the very strange man who
walked around Earthquake Island--where Tom and some friends had been
marooned recently--walked about with a pocketful of what he said were
diamonds. Now Barcoe Jenks was here.

I must see you privately, Tom Swift, went on Mr. Jenks, as he once
more tapped on the glass. Don't waste money buying diamonds, when you
and I can make better ones. Where can I have a talk with you? I-- Mr.
Jenks suddenly looked down the dimly-lighted street. They're coming
back! he cried. I don't want to be seen. I'll call at your house later
to-night--be on the watch for me--until then--good-by!

He waved his hand, and was gone in an instant. Tom stood staring at the
glass door. He hardly knew whether to believe it or not--perhaps it was
all a dream.

He pinched himself to make sure that he was awake. Very substantial
flesh met his thumb and finger, and he felt the pain.

I'm awake all right, he murmured. But Barcoe Jenks here--and still
talking that nonsense about his manufactured diamonds. I think he must
be crazy. I wonder--

Once more the lad's musing was interrupted. He heard a murmur of excited
voices outside the store, on the street. Then the door of the jewelry
shop was tried. Mr. Track's face was pressed against the glass.

Open the door! Let me in, Tom! he called. I've caught the thief, and
as the lad unlocked the portal he saw that the jeweler held by the arm
a ragged lad. Ah; you scoundrel! I've caught you! cried the diamond
merchant, shaking the small chap, while Tom looked on, more mystified
than ever.




CHAPTER II--A MIDNIGHT VISIT


While Mr. Track, the jeweler, and several citizens, attracted by the
chase after the supposed thief, are crowded into the store, anxious to
hear explanations of the strange affair, I will take the opportunity to
tell you something of Tom Swift, the lad who is to figure in this story.

Many of you have already made his acquaintance, when he has been
speeding about in his airship or fast electric runabout, and to others
we will state that our hero first made his bow to the public in the
book called Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle, the initial volume of this
series.

In that story there was related how Tom made the acquaintance of an
odd individual, named Mr. Wakefield Damon, who was continually blessing
himself, some part of his anatomy, or his possessions. Mr. Damon was
riding a motor-cycle, and it started to climb a tree, to his pain and
fright. Afterward Tom purchased the machine, and had many adventures
on it, including a chase after a gang of men who had stolen a valuable
patent model belonging to Mr. Swift.

Mr. Swift and his son were both inventors. They lived together in a
fine house in the suburbs of Shopton, New York, and with them dwelt Mrs.
Baggert, the housekeeper (for Tom's mother was dead), and also Garret
Jackson, an expert engineer, who aided the young inventor and his father
in perfecting many machines.

There was also another semi-member of the household, to wit, Eradicate
Sampson, an eccentric colored man, who owned a mule called Boomerang.
Eradicate did odd jobs around the place, and the mule assisted his
owner--that is when the mule felt like it.

In the second volume of the series, entitled Tom Swift and His
Motor-Boat, there was related the incidents following a pursuit after
a gang of unprincipled men, who sought to get possession of some of Mr.
Swift's patents, and it was while in this boat that Tom, his father, and
a friend, Ned Newton, rescued from Lake Carlopa a Mr. John Sharp, who
fell from his burning balloon. Mr. Sharp was a skilled aeronaut, and
after his recovery he joined Tom in building a big airship, called the
Red Cloud. Tom's adventures in this craft are set down in detail in the
third volume of the series, called Tom Swift and His Airship. Not only
did he and Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon make a great trip, but they captured
some bank robbers, and incidentally cleared themselves from the
imputation of having looted the vault of seventy-five thousand dollars,
which charge was fostered by a certain Mr. Foger, and his son Andy, who
was Tom's enemy.

Not satisfied with having conquered the air, Tom and his father set
to work to gain a victory over the ocean. They built a boat that could
navigate under water, and, in the fourth book of the series, called Tom
Swift and His Submarine Boat, you will find an account of how they went
under the ocean to secure a sunken treasure, and the fight they had with
their enemies who sought to get it away from them. They went through
many perils, not the least of which was capture by a foreign warship.

In the fifth book, entitled Tom Swift and His Electric Runabout, there
was told the story of a wonderfully speedy electric automobile the young
inventor constructed, and how he made a great race in it, and saved from
ruin a bank, in which his father and Mr. Damon were interested.

Tom's ability as an inventor had, by this time, become well known. One
day, as related in a volume called Tom Swift and His Wireless Message,
 he received a letter from a Mr. Hosmer Fenwick, of Philadelphia, asking
his aid in perfecting an airship which the resident of the Quaker
City had built, but which would not work. In his small monoplane, the
Butterfly, Tom and Mr. Damon went to Philadelphia, as Mr. Damon was
acquainted with Mr. Fenwick.

Tom carefully inspected the Whizzer which was the name of Mr. Fenwick's
airship, and, after some difficulties, succeeded in getting the electric
craft in shape to make a flight.

Tom, Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick started to make a trip to Cape May in the
Whizzer, but were caught in a terrific storm, and blown out to sea.
The wind became a hurricane, the airship was disabled, and wrecked in
mid-air. When it fell to earth it landed on one of the small West Indian
islands, but what was the terror of the three castaways to find that the
island was subject to earthquake shocks.

But the earth-tremors were not the only surprise in store for Tom and
his two friends, On the island they found five men and two ladies, who,
by strange chance, had been stranded there when the yacht Resolute,
owned by Mr. George Hosbrook, was wrecked in the same storm that
disabled the airship. Mr. Hosbrook, a millionaire, was taking a party of
friends to the West Indies.

When the castaways (among whom were Mr. and Mrs. Amos Nestor, parents
of Mary Nestor, a girl of whom Tom was very fond) found that there was
danger of the island being destroyed in an earthquake, they were in
despair. There seemed no way of being rescued, as the island was out of
the line of regular ship travel.

Tom, however, was resourceful. With the electrical apparatus from the
wrecked airship, he built a wireless plant, and sent messages for help,
broadcast over the ocean.

They were finally heard, and answered, by an operator on board the
steamer Camberanian, which came on under forced draught, and rescued
Tom and his friends. It was only just in time, for, no sooner had
they gotten aboard the steamer in lifeboats, than the whole island was
destroyed by an earthquake shock.

But Tom, the parents of Mary Nestor, Mr. Damon, Mr. Fenwick, and all the
others, got safely home. Among the survivors from the yacht Resolute
was a Mr. Barcoe Jenks, who now, most unexpectedly, had confronted Tom
through the glass window of the jewelry store. Mr. Jenks was a peculiar
man. Tom discovered this on Earthquake Island. Mr. Jenks carried with
him some stones which he said were diamonds. He asserted that he had
made them, but Tom did not know whether or not to believe this.

When it seemed that the castaways would not be saved Mr. Jenks offered
Tom a large sum in these same diamonds for some plan whereby he might
escape the earthquakes. Mr. Jenks said there was a certain secret in
connection with the manufactured diamonds that he had to solve--that he
had been defrauded of his rights--and that a certain Phantom Mountain
figured in it. But Tom, at that time, paid little attention to Mr.
Jenks' talk. The time was to come, however, when he would attach much
importance to it.

When this story opens, Tom was more interested in Mr. Barcoe Jenks than
in any one else, and was wondering what he wanted to see him about. The
young inventor could not quite understand how Mr. Track, the jeweler,
could come back with a lad he suspected of being a thief, when the
person who had acted so suspiciously, and who had knocked on the glass,
was the queer man, Mr. Jenks.

Yes, Tom I caught him, the jeweler went on. I chased after him, and
nabbed him. It was hard work, too, for I'm not a good runner. Now, you
little rascal, tell me why you tried to rob my store? and the diamond
merchant shook the lad roughly.

I--I didn't try to rob your store, was the timid answer.

Well, perhaps you didn't, exactly, but your confederates did. Why did
you rap on the glass, and why were you staring in so intently?

I wasn't lookin' in.

Well, if it wasn't you, it was some one just like you. But why did you
run when I raced down the street?

I--I don't know, and the lad began to snivel. I--I jest ran--that's
all--'cause I see everybody else runnin', an' I thought there was a
fire.

Ha! That's a likely story! You ran because you are guilty! I'm going to
hand you over to the police.

Did he get anything, Mr. Track? asked one of the men who had joined
the jeweler in the chase.

No, I can't say that he did. He didn't get a chance. Tom Swift was
in here at the time. But this fellow was only waiting for a chance to
steal, or else to aid his confederates.

But, if he didn't take anything, I don't see how you can have him
arrested, went on the man.

On suspicion; that's how! asserted Mr. Track. Will some one get me a
constable?

I wouldn't call a constable, said Tom, quietly.

Why not?

Because that isn't the person who looked in your window.

How do you know, Tom?

Because that person came back while you were out. I saw him.

You saw him? Did he try to steal any of my diamonds, Tom?

No, I guess he doesn't need any.

Why not? There was wonder in the jeweler's tone.

Why, he claims he can make all he wants.

Make diamonds?

So he says.

Why, he must be crazy! and Mr. Track laughed.

Perhaps he is, admitted Tom, I'm only telling you what he says. He's
the person who acted so suspiciously. He came back here, I'm telling
you, while you were running down the street, and spoke to me.

Oh, then you know him? The jeweler's voice was suspicious.

I didn't at first, admitted Tom. But when he said he was Mr.
Barcoe Jenks, I remembered that I had met him when I was cast away on
Earthquake Island.

And he says he can make diamonds? asked Mr. Track.

What did he want of you? and the jeweler looked at Tom, quizzically.

He wanted to have a talk with me, replied the lad, and when he saw
me in your store, he tried to attract my attention by knocking on the
glass.

That's a queer way to do, declared Mr. Track. What did he want?

I don't know exactly, answered Tom, not caring to go into details just
then. But I'm sure, Mr. Track, that you've got the wrong person there.
That lad never looked in the window, nor knocked on the glass.

That's right--I didn't, asserted the captive.

The jeweler looked doubtful.

Why did you run? he asked.

I told you, I thought there was a fire.

That's right, I don't believe he's the fellow you want, put in another
man. I was standing on the corner, near White's grocery store, and
I noticed this lad. That was before I heard you yelling, and saw you
coming, and then I joined in the chase. I guess the man you were after
got away, Track.

He did, asserted Tom. He came back here, a little while ago, and he
ran away just now, as he heard you coming.

Where did he go? asked the jeweler, eagerly.

I don't know, answered Tom. Only you've got the wrong lad here.

Well, perhaps I have, admitted the diamond merchant. You can go,
youngster, but next time, don't run if you're not guilty.

I thought there was a fire, repeated the lad, as he hurriedly slipped
through the crowd in the store, and disappeared down the dark street.

Well, I guess the excitement's all over, and, anyhow, you weren't
robbed, Track, said a stout man, as he left the store. The others soon
followed, and Tom and the jeweler were once more alone in the shop.

Can you tell me something about this man, Tom? asked Mr. Track,
eagerly. So he really makes diamonds. Who is he?

I'd rather not tell--just now, replied the young inventor. I don't
take much stock in him, myself. I think he's visionary. He may think he
has made diamonds, and he may have made some stones that look like them.
I'm very skeptical.

If you could bring me some, Tom, I could soon tell whether they were
real or not. Can you?

The lad shook his head.

I don't expect to see Mr. Jenks again, he said. He talked
rather wildly about waiting to meet me, but that man is odd--crazy,
perhaps--and I don't imagine I'll see him. He's harmless, but he's
eccentric. Well, there was quite some excitement for a time.

I should say there was. I thought it was a plan to rob me, and the
jeweler began putting away the diamond pins. In fact, the excitement
so filled the minds of himself and Tom that neither of them thought any
more of the object of the lad's visit, and the young inventor departed
without purchasing the pin he had come after.

It was not until he was out on the street, walking toward his home, that
the matter came back to his mind.

I declare! he exclaimed. I didn't get that pin for Mary, after all!
Well, never mind, I have a week until her birthday, and I can get it
to-morrow.

He walked rapidly toward home, for the weather looked threatening, and
Tom had no umbrella. He was musing on the happenings of the evening when
he reached his house. His father was out, as was Garret Jackson, the
engineer; and Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper, was entertaining a lady in
the sitting-room, so, as Tom was rather tired, he went directly to his
own room, and, a little later got into bed.

It was shortly after midnight when he was awakened by hearing a rattling
on the window of his room. The reason he was able to fix the time
so accurately was because as soon as he awakened he pressed a little
electric button, and it illuminated the face of a small clock on his
bureau. The hands pointed to five minutes past twelve.

Humph! That sounds like hail! exclaimed Tom, as he arose, and looked
out of the casement. I wonder if any of the skylights of the airship
shed are open? There might be some damage. Guess I'd better go out and
take a look.

He had mentally reasoned this far before he had looked out, and when
he saw that the moon was brightly shining in a clear sky, he was a bit
surprised.

Why--that wasn't hail, he murmured. It isn't even raining. I wonder
what it was?

He was answered a moment later, for a shower of fine gravel from the
walk flew up and clattered against the glass. With a start, Tom looked
down, and saw a dark figure standing under an apple tree.

Hello! Who's there? called the lad, after he had raised the sash.

It's I--Mr. Jenks, was the surprising answer.

Mr. Jenks? repeated Tom.

Yes--Barcoe Jenks, of Earthquake Island.

You here? What do you want?

Can you come down?

What for?

Tom Swift, I've something very important to tell you, was the answer
in a low voice, yet which carried to Tom's ears perfectly. Do you want
to make a fortune for yourself--and for me?

How? Tom was beginning to think more and more that Mr. Jenks was
crazy.

How? By helping me to discover the secret of Phantom Mountain, where
the diamonds are made! Will you?

Wait a minute--I'll come down, answered Tom, and he began to grope for
his clothes in the dim light of the little electric lamp.

What was the secret of Phantom Mountain? What did Mr. Jenks really want?
Could he make diamonds? Tom asked himself these questions as he hastily
dressed to go down to his midnight visitor.




CHAPTER III--A STRANGE STORY


Well, Mr. Jenks, began Tom, when he had descended to the garden, and
greeted the man who had acted so strangely on Earthquake Island, this
is rather an odd time for a visit.

I realize that, Tom Swift, was the answer, and the lad noticed that
the man spoke much more calmly than he had that evening at the jewelry
shop. I realize that, but I have to be cautious in my movements.

Why?

Because there are enemies on my track. If they thought I was seeking
aid to discover the secret of Phantom Mountain, my life might pay the
forfeit.

Are you in earnest, Mr. Jenks?

I certainly am, and, while I must apologize for awakening you at this
unseemly hour, and for the mysterious nature of my visit, if you will
let me tell my story, you will see the need of secrecy.

Oh, I don't mind being awakened, answered Tom, good-naturedly, but
I will be frank with you, Mr. Jenks. I hardly can believe what you have
stated to me several times--that you know how diamonds can be made.

I can prove it to you, was the quiet answer.

Yes, I know. For centuries men have tried to discover the secret of
transmuting base metals into gold, and how to make diamonds by chemical
means. But they have all been failures.

All except this process--the process used at Phantom Mountain,
 insisted the queer man. Do you want to hear my story?

I have no objections.

Then let me warn you, went on Mr. Jenks, that if you do hear it, you
will be so fascinated by it that I am sure you will want to cast your
lot in with mine, and aid me to get my rights, and solve the mystery.
And I also want to warn you that if you do, there is a certain amount of
danger connected with it.

I'm used to danger, answered Tom, quietly. Let me hear your story.
But first explain how you came to come here, and why you acted so
strangely at the jewelry store.

Willingly. I tried to attract your attention at the store, because I
saw that you were going to buy a diamond, and I didn't want you to.

Why not?

Because I want to present you with a beautiful stone, that will answer
your purpose as well or better, than any one you could buy. That will
prove my story better than any amount of words or argument. But I could
not attract your attention without also attracting that of the jeweler.
He became suspicious, gave chase, and I thought it best to vanish. I
hope no one was made to suffer for what may have been my imprudence.

No, the lad whom Mr. Track caught was let go. But how did you happen to
come to Shopton?

To see you. I got your address from the owner of the yacht Resolute. I
knew that if there was one person who could aid me to recover my rights,
it would be you, Tom Swift. Will you help me? Will you come with me to
discover the secret of Phantom Mountain? If we go, it will have to be in
an airship, for in no other way, I think, can we come upon the place, as
it is closely guarded. Will you come? I will pay you well.

Perhaps I had better hear your story, said the young inventor. But
first let me suggest that we move farther away from the house. My
father, or Mr. Jackson, or the housekeeper, may hear us talking, and it
may disturb them. Come with me to my private shop, and Tom led the way
to a small building where he did experimental work. He unlocked the door
with a key he carried, turned on the lights, which were run by a storage
battery, and motioned Mr. Jenks to a seat.

Now I'll hear your story, said Tom.

I'll make it as short as possible, went on the queer man. To begin
with, it is now several years ago since a poorly dressed stranger
applied to me one night for money enough to get a meal and a bed to
sleep in. I was living in New York City at the time, and this was
midnight, as I was returning home from my club.

I was touched by the man's appearance, and gave him some money. He
asked for my card, saying he would repay me some day. I gave it to him,
little thinking I would hear from the man again. But I did. He called
at my apartments about a week later, saying he had secured work as an
expert setter of diamonds, and wanted to repay me. I did not want to
take his money, but the fact that such a sorry looking specimen of
manhood as he had been when I aided him, was an expert handler of gems
interested me. I talked with the man, and he made a curious statement.

This man, who gave his name as Enos Folwell, said he knew a place where
diamonds could be made, partly in a scientific manner, and partly by the
forces of nature. I laughed at him, but he told me so many details that
I began to believe him. He said he and some other friends of his, who
were diamond cutters, had a plant in the midst of the Rocky Mountains,
where they had succeeded in making several small, but very perfect
diamonds. They had come to the end of their rope, though, so to speak,
because they could not afford to buy the materials needed. Folwell
said that he and his companions had temporarily separated, had left the
mountain where they made diamonds, and agreed to meet there later when
they had more money with which to purchase materials. They had all
agreed to go out into civilization, and work for enough funds to enable
them to go on with their diamond making.

I hardly knew whether to believe the man or not, but he offered proof.
He had several small, but very perfect diamonds with him, and he gave
them to me, to have tested in any way I desired.

I promised to look into the matter, and, as I was quite wealthy, as,
in fact I am now, and if I found that the stones he gave me were real, I
said I might invest some money in the plant.

Were the diamonds good? asked Tom, who was beginning to be interested.

They were--stones of the first water, though small. An expert gem
merchant, to whom I took them, said he had never seen any diamonds like
them, and he wanted to know where I got them. Of course I did not tell
him.

To make a long story short, I saw Folwell again, told him to
communicate with his companions, and to tell them that I would agree to
supply the cash needed, if I could share in the diamond making. To this
they agreed, and, after some weeks spent in preparation, a party of us
set out for Phantom Mountain.

Phantom Mountain? interrupted Tom. Where is it?

I don't know, exactly--it's somewhere in the Rockies, but the exact
location is a mystery. That is why I need your help. You will soon
understand the reason. Well, as I said, myself, Folwell and the others,
who were not exactly prepossessing sort of men, started west. When we
got to a small town, called Indian Ridge, near Leadville, Colorado,
the men insisted that I must now proceed in secret, and consent to be
blindfolded, as they were not yet ready to reveal the secret of the
place where they made the diamonds.

I did not want to agree to this, but they insisted, and I gave in,
foolishly perhaps. At any rate I was blindfolded one night, placed in
a wagon, and we drove off into the mountains. After traveling for some
distance I was led, still blindfolded, up a steep trail.

When the bandage was taken off my eyes I saw that I was in a large
cave. The men were with me, and they apologized for the necessity that
caused them to blindfold me. They said they were ready to proceed with
the making of diamonds, but I must promise not to seek to discover the
secret until they gave me permission, nor was I to attempt to leave the
cave. I had to agree.

Next they demanded that I give them a large sum, which I had promised
when they showed me, conclusively, that they could make diamonds. I
refused to do this until I had seen some of the precious stones, and
they agreed that this was fair, but said I would have to wait a few
days.

Well, I waited, and, all that while, I was virtually a prisoner in the
cave. All I could learn was that it was in the midst of a great range,
near the top, and that one of the peaks was called Phantom Mountain.
Why, I did not learn until later.

At last one night, during a terrific thunder storm, the leader of the
diamond makers--Folwell--announced that I could now see the stones made.
The men had been preparing their chemicals for some days previous. I
was taken into a small chamber of the cave, and there saw quite a
complicated apparatus. Part of it was a great steel box, with a lever on
it.

We will let you make some diamonds for yourself, Folwell said to me,
and he directed me to pull the lever of the box, at a certain signal.
The signal came, just as a terrific crash of thunder shook the very
mountain inside of which we were. The box of steel got red-hot, and when
it cooled off it was opened, and was given a handful of white stones.

Were they diamonds? asked Tom, eagerly.

Mr. Jenks held out one hand. In the palm glittered a large
stone--ostensibly a diamond. In the rays of the moon it showed all the
colors of the rainbow--a beautiful gem. That is one of the stones I
made--or rather that I supposed I had made, went on Mr. Jenks. It is
one of several I have, but they have not all been cut and polished as
has this one.

Naturally I was much impressed by what I saw, and, after I had made
certain tests which convinced me that the stones in the steel box were
diamonds, I paid over the money as I had promised. That was my undoing.

How?

As soon as the men got the cash, they had no further use for me. The
next I remember is eating a rude meal, while we discussed the future of
making diamonds. I knew nothing more until I found myself back in the
small hotel at Indian Ridge, whence I had gone some time previous, with
the men, to the cave in the mountain.

What happened? asked Tom, much surprised by the unexpected outcome of
the affair.

I had been tricked, that was all! As soon as the men had my
money they had no further use for me. They did not want me to learn the
secret of their diamond making, and they drugged me, carried me away
from the cave, and left me in the hotel.

Didn't you try to find the cave again?

I did, but without avail. I spent some time in the Rockies, but no one
could tell where Phantom Mountain was; in fact, few had heard of it, and
I was nearly lost searching for it.

I came back East, determined to get even. I had given the men a
very large sum of money, and, in exchange, they had given me several
diamonds. Probably the stones are worth nearly as much as the money I
invested, but I was cheated, for I was promised an equal share in the
profits. These were denied me, and I was tricked. I determined to be
revenged, or at least to discover the secret of making diamonds. It is
my right.

I agree with you, spoke Tom.

But, up to the time I met you on Earthquake Island, I could form no
plan for discovering Phantom Mountain, and learning the secret of the
diamond makers, went on Mr. Jenks. I carried the gems about with me,
as you doubtless saw when we were on the island. But I knew I needed an
airship in which to fly over the mountains, and pick out the location of
the cave where the diamonds are made.

But how can you locate it, if you were blindfolded when you were taken
there, Mr. Jenks?

I forgot to tell you that, on our journey into the mountains, and just
before I was carried into the cave, I managed to raise one corner of
the bandage. I caught a glimpse of a very peculiarly shaped cliff--it
is like a great head, standing out in bold relief against the moonlight,
when I saw it. That head of rock is near the cave. It may be the
landmark by which we can locate Phantom Mountain.

Perhaps, admitted the young inventor.

What I want to know is this, went on Mr. Jenks. Will you go with me
on this quest--go in your airship to discover the secret of the diamond
makers? If you will, I will share with you whatever diamonds we can
discover, or make; besides paying all expenses. Will you go, Tom Swift?

The young inventor did not know what to answer. How far was Mr. Jenks
to be trusted? Were the stones he had real diamonds? Was his story,
fantastical as it sounded--true? Would it be safe for Tom to go?

The lad asked himself these questions. Mr. Jenks saw his hesitation.

Here, said the strange man, I will prove what I say. Take this
diamond. I intended it for you, anyhow, for what you did for me on
Earthquake Island. Take it, and--and give it to the person for whom you
were about to purchase a diamond to-night. But, first of all, take it to
a gem expert, and get his opinion. That will prove the truth of what
I say, Tom Swift, and I feel sure that you will cast your lot in with
mine, and help me to discover the secret of Phantom Mountain, and aid me
to get my rights from the diamond makers!




CHAPTER IV--ANDY FOGER GETS A FRIGHT


Tom Swift considered a few minutes. On the face of it, the proposition
appealed to him. He had been home some time now after his adventures on
Earthquake Island, and he was beginning to long for more excitement. The
search for the mysterious mountain, and the cave of the diamond makers,
might offer a new field for him. But there came to him a certain
distrust of Mr. Jenks.

I don't like to doubt your word, began Tom, slowly, but you know,
Mr. Jenks, that some of the greatest chemists have tried in vain to make
diamonds; or, at best, they have made only tiny ones. To think that any
man, or set of men, made real diamonds as large as the ones you have,
doesn't seem--well-- and Tom hesitated.

You mean you can hardly believe me? asked Mr. Jenks.

I guess that's it, assented Tom.

I don't blame you a bit! exclaimed the odd man. In fact, I didn't
believe it when they told me they could make diamonds. But they proved
it to me. I'm ready now to prove it to you.

I'll tell you what I'll do. Here's this one stone, cut ready for
setting. Here's another, uncut, and Mr. Jenks drew from his pocket
what looked like a piece of crystal. Take them to any jeweler, he
resumed--to the one in whose place I saw you to-night. I'll abide by
the verdict you get, and I'll come here to-morrow night, and hear what
you have to say.

Why do you come at night? asked Tom, thinking there was something
suspicious in that.

Because my life might be in danger if I was seen talking to you, and
showing you diamonds in the daytime--especially just now.

Why at this particular time?

For the reason that the diamond makers are on my trail. As long as I
remained quiet, after their shabby treatment of me, and did not try to
discover their secret, they were all right. But, after I realized that
I had been cheated out of my rights, and when I began to make an
investigation, with a view to discovering their secret whereabouts, I
received mysterious and anonymous warnings to stop.

But I did not. I came East, and tried to get help to discover the cave
of the diamond makers, but I was unsuccessful. I needed an airship, as
I said, and no person who could operate one, would agree to go with
me on the quest. Again I received a warning to drop all search for the
diamond makers, but I persisted, and about a week ago I found I was
being shadowed.

Shadowed; by whom? asked Tom.

By a man I never remember seeing, but who, I have no doubt, is one of
the diamond-making gang.

Do you think he means you harm?

I'm sure of it. That is the reason I have to act so in secret, and come
to see you at night. I don't want those scoundrels to find out what I am
about to do. On my return from Earthquake Island, I again endeavored to
interest an airship man in my plan, but he evidently thought me insane.
Then I thought of you, as I had done before, but I was afraid you, too,
would laugh at my proposition. However, I decided to come here, and I
did. It seemed almost providential that my first view of you was in
a jewelry shop, looking at diamonds. I took it as a good omen. Now it
remains with you. May I call here to-morrow night, and get your answer?

Tom Swift made up his mind quickly. After all it would be easy enough to
find out if the diamonds were real. If they were, he could then decide
whether or not to go with Mr. Jenks on the mysterious quest. So he
answered:

I'll consider the matter, Mr. Jenks. I'll meet you here to-morrow
night. In the meanwhile, for my own satisfaction, I'll let an expert
look at these stones.

Get the greatest diamond expert in the world, and he'll pronounce them
perfect! predicted the odd man. Now I'll bid you goodnight, and be
going. I'll be here at this time to-morrow.

As Mr. Jenks turned aside there was a movement among the trees in the
orchard, and a shadowy figure was seen hurrying away.

Who's that? asked the diamond man, in a hoarse whisper. Did you see
that, Tom Swift? Some one was here--listening to what I said! Perhaps it
was the man who has been shadowing me!

I think not. I guess it was Eradicate Sampson, a colored man who does
work for us, said Tom. Is that you, Rad? he called.

Yais, sah, Massa Tom, heah I is! answered the voice of the negro,
but it came from an entirely different direction than that in which the
shadowy figure had been seen.

Where are you, Rad? called the young inventor.

Right heah, was the reply, and the colored man came from the direction
of the stable. I were jest out seein' if mah mule Boomerang were all
right. Sometimes he's restless, an' don't sleep laik he oughter.

Then that wasn't you over in the orchard? asked Tom, in some
uneasiness.

No, sah, I ain't been in de orchard. I were sleepin' in mah shack, till
jest a few minutes ago, when I got up, an' went in t' see Boomerang.
I had a dream dat some coon were tryin t' steal him, an' it sort ob
'sturbed me, laik.

If it wasn't your man, it was some one else, said Mr. Jenks,
decidedly.

We'll have a look! exclaimed Tom. Here, Rad, come over and scurry
among those trees. We just saw some one sneaking around.

I'll sure do dat! cried the colored man. Mebby it were somebody arter
Boomerang! I'll find 'em.

I don't believe it was any one after the mule, murmured Mr. Jenks,
but it certainly was some one--more likely some one after me.

The three made a hasty search among the trees, but the intruder had
vanished, leaving no trace. They went out into the road, which the moon
threw into bold relief along its white stretch, but there was no figure
scurrying away.

Whoever it was, is gone, spoke Tom. You can go back to bed, Rad,
 for the colored man, of late, had been sleeping in a shack on the Swift
premises.

And I guess it's time for me to go, too, added Mr. Jenks. I'll be
here to-morrow night, Tom, and I hope your answer will be favorable.

Tom did not sleep well the remainder of the night, for his fitful
slumbers were disturbed by dreams of enormous caves, filled with
diamonds, with dark, shadowy figures trying to put him into a red-hot
steel box. Once he awakened with a start, and put his hand under his
pillow to feel if the two stones Mr. Jenks had given him, were still
there. They had not been disturbed.

Tom made up his mind to find out if the stones were really diamonds,
before saying anything to his father about the chance of going to seek
Phantom Mountain. And the young inventor wished to get the opinion of
some other jeweler than Mr. Track--at least, at first.

Though if this one proves to be a good gem, I'll have Mr. Track set it
in a brooch, and give it to Mary for her birthday, decided the young
inventor. Guess I'll take a run over to Chester in the Butterfly, and
see what one of the jewelers there has to say.

In addition to his big airship, Red Cloud, Tom owned a small, swift
monoplane, which he called Butterfly. This had been damaged by Andy
Foger just before Tom left on the trip that ended at Earthquake Island,
but the monoplane had been repaired, and Andy had left town, not having
returned since.

Telling his father that he was going off on a little business trip,
which he often did in his aeroplane, Tom, with the aid of Mr. Jackson,
the engineer, wheeled the Butterfly out of its shed.

Adjusting the mechanism, and seeing that it was in good shape, Tom took
his place in one of the two seats, for the monoplane would carry two.
Mr. Jackson then spun the propellers, and, with a crackle and roar the
motor started. Over the ground ran the dainty, little aeroplane, until,
having momentum enough, Tom tilted the wing planes and the machine
sailed up into the air.

Rising about a thousand feet, and circling about several times to test
the wind currents, Tom headed his craft toward Chester, a city about
fifty miles from Shopton. In his pocket, snugly tucked away, were the
two stones Mr. Jenks had given him.

It was not long before Tom saw, looming up in the distance the church
spires and towering factory chimneys of Chester, for his machine was a
speedy one, and could make ninety miles an hour when driven. But now a
slower speed satisfied our hero.

I'll just drop down outside of the city, he reasoned, for too much
of a crowd gathers when I land in the street. Besides I might frighten
horses, and then, too, it's hard to get a good start from the street.
I'll leave it in some barn until I want to go back.

Tom sent his craft down, in order to pick out a safe place for a
landing. He was then over the suburbs of the city, and was following the
line of a straight country road.

Looks like a good place there, he murmured. I'll shut off the motor,
and vol-plane down.

Suiting the action to the word, Tom shut off his power. The little craft
dipped toward the ground, but the lad threw up the forward planes, and
caught a current of air that sent him skimming along horizontally.

As he got nearer to the ground, he saw the figure of a lad riding a
bicycle along the country highway. Something about the figure struck Tom
as being familiar, and he recognized the cyclist a moment later.

It's Andy Foger! said Tom, in a whisper. I wondered where he had been
keeping himself since he damaged the Butterfly. Evidently he doesn't
dare venture back to Shopton. Well, here's where I give him a scare.

Tom's monoplane was making no more noise, now, than a soaring bird. He
was gliding swiftly toward the earth, and, with the plan in his mind of
administering some sort of punishment to the bully, he aimed the machine
directly at him.

Nearer and nearer shot the monoplane, as quietly as a sheet of paper
might fall. Andy pedaled on, never looking up nor behind him, A moment
later, as Tom threw up his headplanes, to make his landing more easy,
and just as he swooped down at one side of the cyclist, our hero let out
a most alarming yell, right into Andy's ear.

Now I've got you! he shouted. I'll teach you to slash my aeroplane!
Come with me!

Andy gave one look at the white bird-like apparatus that had flown up
beside him so noiselessly, and, being too frightened to recognize Tom's
voice, must have thought that he had been overtaken by some supernatural
visitor.

Andy gave a yell like an Indian, about to do a stage scalping act, and
fairly dived over the handlebars of his bicycle, sprawling in a heap on
the dusty road.

I guess that will hold you for a while, observed Tom, grimly, as he
put on the ground-brake and brought his monoplane to a stop not far from
the fallen rider.




CHAPTER V--A MYSTERIOUS MAN


For several minutes Andy Foger did not arise. He remained prostrate in
the dust, and Tom, observing him, thought perhaps the bully might have
been seriously injured. But, a little later, Andy cautiously raised his
head, and inquired in a frightened voice:

Is it--is it gone?

Is what gone? asked Tom, grimly.

At the sound of his voice, Andy looked up. Was that you, Tom Swift? he
demanded. Did you knock me off my wheel?

My monoplane and I together did, was the reply; or, rather, we
didn't. It was the nervous reaction caused by your fright, and
the knowledge that you had done wrong, that made you jump over the
handlebars. That's the scientific explanation.

You--you did it! stammered Andy, getting to his feet. He wasn't hurt
much, Tom thought.

Have it your own way, resumed our hero. Did you think it was a
hob-goblin in a chariot of fire after you, Andy?

Huh! Never mind what I thought! I'll have you arrested for this!

Will you? Delighted, as the boys say. Hop in my airship and I'll take
you right into town. And when I get you there I'll make a charge of
malicious mischief against you, for breaking the propeller of the
Butterfly and slashing her wings. I've mended her up, however, so she
goes better than ever, and I can take you to the police station in jig
time. Want to come, Andy?

This was too much for the bully. He knew that Tom would have a clear
case against him, and he did not dare answer. Instead he shuffled over
to where his wheel lay, picked it up, and rode slowly off.

Good riddance, murmured Tom. He looked about, and saw that he was near
a house, in the rear of which was a good-sized barn. Guess I'll ask
if I can leave the Butterfly there, he murmured, and, ringing the
doorbell, he was greeted by a man.

I'll pay you if you'll let me store my machine in the barn a little
while, until I go into the city, and return, spoke the lad.

Indeed, you're welcome to leave it there without pay, was the answer.
I'm interested in airships, and, I'll consider it a favor if you'll let
me look yours over while it's here.

Tom readily agreed, and a few minutes later he had caught a trolley
going into the city. He was soon in one of the largest jewelry stores of
Chester.

I'd like to get an expert opinion as to whether or not those stones are
diamonds, spoke Tom, to the polite clerk who came up to wait on him,
and our hero handed over the two gems which Mr. Jenks had given him.
I'm willing to pay for the appraisement, of course, the young inventor
added, as he saw the clerk looking rather doubtfully at him, for Tom had
on a rough suit, which he always donned when he flew in his monoplane.

I'll turn them over to our Mr. Porter, a gem expert, said the clerk.
Please be seated.

The young man disappeared into a private office with the stones, and Tom
waited. He wondered if he was going to have his trouble for his pains.
Presently two elderly gentlemen came from the little room, on the glass
door of which appeared the word Diamonds.

Who brought these stones in? asked one of the men, evidently the
proprietor, from the deference paid him by the clerk. The latter
motioned to Tom.

Will you kindly step inside here? requested the elderly man. When the
door was closed, Tom found himself in a room which was mostly taken up
with a bench for the display of precious stones, a few chairs, and some
lights arranged peculiarly; while various scales and instruments stood
on a table.

You wished an opinion on--on these? queried the proprietor of the
place. Tom noticed at once that the word diamonds was not used.

I wanted to find out if they were of any value, he said. Are they
diamonds?

Would you mind stating where you got them? asked the other of the two
men.

Is that necessary? inquired the lad. I came by them in a legitimate
manner, if that's what you mean, and I can satisfy you on that point.
I am willing to pay for any information you may give me as to their
value.

Oh, it isn't that, the proprietor hastened to assure him. But these
are diamonds of such a peculiar kind, so perfect and without a flaw,
that I wondered from what part of the world they came.

Then they are diamonds? asked Tom, eagerly.

The finest I have ever tested! declared the other man, evidently Mr.
Porter, the gem expert. They are a joy to look at, Mr. Roberts, he
went on, turning to the proprietor. If it is possible to get a supply
of them you would be justified in asking half as much again as we charge
for African or Indian diamonds. The Kimberly products are not to be
compared to these, and he looked at the two stones in his hand--the one
cut, and sparkling brilliantly, the other in a rough state.

Do you care to state where these diamonds came from? asked Mr.
Roberts, looking critically at Tom.

I had rather not, answered the lad. It is enough for me to know that
they are diamonds. How much is your charge?

Nothing, was the unexpected answer. We are very glad to have had the
opportunity of seeing such stones. Is there any chance of getting any
more?

Perhaps, answered Tom, as he accepted the gems which the expert held
out to him.

Then might we speak for a supply? went on Mr. Roberts, eagerly. We
will pay you the full market price.

What is the value of these stones? asked Tom.

Mr. Roberts looked at his gem expert.

It is difficult to say, was the answer of the man who had handed Tom
the gems. They are so far superior to the usual run of diamonds, that
I feel justified in saying that the cut one would bring fifteen hundred
dollars, anywhere. In fact, I would offer that for it. The other is
larger, though what it would lose in cutting would be hard to say. I
should say it was worth two thousand dollars as it is now.

Thirty-five hundred dollars for these two stones! exclaimed Tom.

They are worth every cent of it, declared Mr. Roberts. Do you want to
sell?

Tom shook his head. He could scarcely believe the good news. Mr. Jenks
had told the truth. Now the young inventor could go with him to seek the
diamond makers.

Can you get any more of these? went on Mr. Roberts.

I think so--that is I don't know--I am going to try, answered the lad.

Then if you succeed I wish you would sell us some, fairly begged the
proprietor of the store.

I will, promised Tom, but he little knew what lay before him, or
perhaps he would not have made that promise. He thanked the diamond
merchant for his kindness, and arranged to have the cut stone set in a
pin for Miss Nestor. The uncut gem Tom took away with him.

Thinking of many things, and wondering how best to start in his airship
Red Cloud for the mysterious Phantom Mountain, Tom hurried back to where
he had left the monoplane, wheeled it out, and was soon soaring through
the air toward Shopton.

I think I'll go with Mr. Jenks, he decided, as he prepared for a
landing in the open space near his aeroplane shed. It will be a
risky trip, perhaps, but I've taken risks before. When Mr. Jenks comes
to-night I'll tell him I'll help him to get his rights, and discover the
secret of the diamond makers.

As Tom was wheeling the Butterfly into the shed, Eradicate came out to
help him.

Dere's a gen'man here to see yo', Massa Tom, said the colored man.

Who is it?

I dunno. He keep askin' ef yo' de lad what done bust up Earthquake
Island, an' send lightnin' flashes up to de sky, an' all sech questions
laik dat.

It isn't Mr. Damon; is it, Rad? He hasn't been around in some time.

No, Massa Tom, it ain't him. I knows dat blessin' man good an' proper.
I jest wish he'd bless mah mule Boomerang some day, an' take some oh
de temper out ob him. No, sah, it ain't Massa Damon. De gen'man's in de
airship shed waitin' fo' you.

In the airship shed! No strangers are allowed in there, Rad.

I knows it, Massa Tom, but he done persisted his se'f inter it, an'
he wouldn't come out when I told him; an' your pa an' Mr. Jackson ain't
home.

I'll see about this, exclaimed Tom, striding to the large shed, where
the Red Cloud was kept. As he entered it he saw a man looking over the
wonderful craft.

Did you want to see me? asked Tom, sharply, for he did not like
strangers prowling around.

I did, and I apologize for entering here, but I am interested in
airships, and I thought you might want to hire a pilot. I am in need
of employment, and I have had considerable to do with balloons and
aeroplanes, but never with an airship like this, which combines the two
features. Do you wish to hire any one.

No, I don't! replied Tom, sharply, for he did not like the looks of
the man.

I was told that you did, was the rather surprising answer.

Who told you?

The man looked all around the shed, before replying, as if fearful of
being overheard. Then, stepping close to Tom, he whispered:

Mr. Jenks told me!

Mr. Jenks? Tom could not conceal his astonishment.

Yes. Mr. Barcoe Jenks. But I did not come here to merely ask you for
employment. I would like to hire out to you, but the real object of my
visit was to say this to you.

The man approached still closer to Tom, and, in a lower voice, and one
that could scarcely be heard, he fairly hissed:

Don't go with Barcoe Jenks to seek the diamond makers!

Then, before Tom could put out a hand to detain him, had the lad so
wished, the man turned suddenly, and fairly ran from the shed.




CHAPTER VI--MR. DAMON IS ON HAND


The young inventor stood almost spellbound for a few moments. Then
recovering himself he made a dash for the door through which the
mysterious man had disappeared. Tom saw him sprinting down the road, and
was half-minded to take after him, but a cooler thought warned him that
he had better not.

He may be one of those men who are on Mr. Jenks' trail, reasoned Tom,
in which case it might not be altogether safe to attempt to stop him,
and make him explain. Or he may be a lunatic, and in that case it
wouldn't be altogether healthy to interfere with him.

I'll just let him go, and tell Mr. Jenks about him when he comes
to-night. But I must warn Rad never to let him in here again. He might
damage the airship.

Calling to the colored man, Tom pointed to the stranger, who was almost
out of sight down the road, and said earnestly:

Rad, do you see that fellow?

I sho do, Massa Tom, but I sorter has t' strain my eyes t' do it. He's
goin' laik my mule Boomerang does when he's comm' home t' dinnah.

That's right, Rad. Well, never let that man set foot inside our fence
again! If he comes, and I'm home, call me. If I'm away, call dad or Mr.
Jackson, and if you're here alone, drive him away, somehow.

I will, Massa Tom! exclaimed the colored man, earnestly, an' if I
can't do it alone, I'll get Boomerang t' help. Once let dat ar' mule
git his heels on a pusson, an' dat pusson ain't goin' t' come bodderin'
around any mo'--that is, not right away.

I believe you, Rad. Well, keep a lookout for him, and don't let him
in, and with that Tom entered the house to think over matters. They
were beginning to assume an aspect he did not altogether like. Not that
Tom was afraid of danger, but he preferred to meet it in the open, and
the warning, or threat, of the mysterious man disquieted him.

When Mr. Swift came home, a little later, his son told him of the
midnight interview with Mr. Jenks, for, up to this time, the aged
inventor was unaware of it, and Tom also gave an account of the
diamonds, speaking of their value.

And do you propose to go to Phantom Mountain, in search of the makers
of these gems, Tom? asked Mr. Swift.

I had about decided to do so, dad.

And you're going in the Red Cloud?'

Yes.

Who are going with you?

Well, Mr. Jenks will go, of course, and I've no doubt but that if I
mention the prospective trip to Mr. Damon, that he'll bless his skating
cap, or something like that, and come along.

I suppose so, Tom, and I'd like to have you take him. But I think
you'll need some one else.

Because, from what you have told me, you are going out to a dangerous
part of the country, and you may have to deal with unscrupulous men.
Three of you are hardly enough to cope with them. You ought to have at
least another member of your party. If I was not busy on my invention of
a new wireless motor I would go along, but I can't leave. You might take
Mr. Jackson.

No, you need him here to help you, dad.

How about Eradicate?

Tom smiled.

Rad would get homesick for his mule Boomerang, and I'd have to bring
him back just when we'd found the diamonds, replied the young inventor.
No, we'll have to think of some one else. I'll ask Mr. Damon, and then
I'll consider matters further. I expect to see Mr. Jenks to-night, and
he may have some one in mind.

Perhaps that will be a good plan. Well, Tom, I trust you will take good
care of yourself, and not run into unnecessary danger. Is the Red Cloud
in good shape for the voyage?

It needs looking over. I'm going to get right at it.

It's a pretty indefinite sort of a quest you're going on, Tom, my son.
How do you expect to find Phantom Mountain?

Well, it's going to be quite a task. In the first place we'll head for
Leadville, Colorado, and then we'll go to Indian Ridge and make some
inquiries. We may get on the track of the place that way. If we don't,
why I'll take the airship up as high as is necessary and sort of
prospect until we see that big cliff that's shaped like a head. That
will give us something to go by.

Well, do the best you can. If you can discover the secret of making
diamonds it will be a valuable one.

I guess it will, dad; and Mr. Jenks is entitled to know it, for he paid
his good money to that end. He has promised to go halves with me, as
payment for the use of the airship, and I must say the two diamonds he
gave me last night have proved very valuable.

Two diamonds, Tom? You only showed me one, an uncut gem; and Mr. Swift
looked at his son.

Oh, the other--er--the other is--I left it with a jeweler, and Tom
blushed a trifle, as he thought of the present he contemplated making to
Mary Nestor.

That afternoon, as Tom was out in the shed of the Red Cloud looking over
the airship, to see what would be necessary to do to it in order to get
it in shape for a long trip, he heard voices outside.

Yes--yes, I know the way in perfectly well, he caught. You needn't
bother to come, my good fellow. Just step this way, and I'll show you
something worth seeing.

I wonder if it's that mysterious man coming back? thought Tom. He
dropped the tool he was using, and hurried to the door. As he approached
it he heard the voice continue.

Why bless my shoe laces, Mr. Parker! You'll see a wonderful airship, I
promise you. Wonderful! Bless my hatband, but I hope Tom is here!

Mr. Damon! exclaimed our hero, as he recognized the tones of his
eccentric friend. But who is with him?

A moment later he caught sight of the gentleman who was always blessing
himself, or something. Behind him stood another man, whose features Tom
could not see plainly.

Hello, Tom Swift! called Mr. Damon. Looking over the Red Cloud, eh?
Does that mean you're off on another trip?

I guess it does, answered the lad.

Where to this time? if I may ask.

I'm thinking of going off to the mountains to find a band of men
engaged in making diamonds, replied Tom.

Making diamonds! Bless my finger ring! Making diamonds! A trip to the
mountains! Bless my disposition! but do you know I'd like to go with
you!

I was thinking of asking you, Mr. Damon.

Were you? Bless my heart, I'm glad you thought of me. You don't by any
possible chance want another person; do you?

We were thinking of having four in the party, Mr. Damon, and Tom
wondered who was with his eccentric friend.

Then bless my election ticket! This is the very chance for you, Mr.
Parker! cried Mr. Damon. Will you go with us? It will be just what you
need, and Mr. Damon stepped aside, revealing to Tom the features of Mr.
Ralph Parker, the scientist who had correctly predicted the destruction
of Earthquake Island.




CHAPTER VII--MR. PARKER PREDICTS


Tom Swift was a most generous lad, but when he saw that Mr. Damon had
with him Mr. Parker, the gloomy scientist, who seemed to take delight in
predicting disasters, our hero's spirits were not exactly of the best.
He would have much preferred not to take Mr. Parker on the quest for the
diamond makers, but, since Mr. Damon had mentioned it, he did not see
how he could very well refuse.

But perhaps he won't care to go, thought Tom.

He was undeceived a moment later, however, for the scientist remarked:

I am very glad to meet you once more, Mr. Swift. I have scarcely thanked
you enough for what you did for us in erecting your wireless station on
Earthquake Island, which, as you recall, I predicted would sink into
the sea. It did, I am glad to say, not because I like to see islands
destroyed, but because science has been vindicated. Now I have just
heard you remark that you are about to set off to the mountains in
search of some men who are making diamonds. I need hardly state that
this is utterly useless, for no diamonds, commercially valuable, can be
made by men. But the trip may be valuable in that it will permit me to
demonstrate some scientific facts.

Therefore, if you will permit me, I will be very glad to accompany you
and Mr. Damon. I shall be delighted, in short, and I can start as soon
as you are ready.

There's no hope for it! thought Tom, dismally. I suppose he'll wake
up every morning, and predict that before night the world will come to
an end, or he'll prophesy that the airship will blow up, and vanish,
when about seven miles above the clouds. Well, there's no way out of it,
so here goes.

Thereupon Tom welcomed the scientist as cordially as he could, and
invited him to form one of the party that would set off in the airship
to search for Phantom Mountain.

Bless my jewelry box! exclaimed Mr. Damon, when this formality was
over. Tell me more about it, Tom.

Which our hero did, stating the need of maintaining secrecy on account
of the danger to Mr. Jenks. Mr. Damon and Mr. Parker both agreed to say
nothing about the matter, and then the scientist became much interested
in the Red Cloud, which he closely examined. He even complimented Tom on
the skill shown in making it, and, contrary to our hero's expectation,
did not predict that it would blow up the next time it was used.

How did you happen to arrive just at this time, Mr. Damon? asked Tom.

It was partly due to Mr. Parker, was the answer. I had not seen him
since we were rescued from the island, until a few days ago he called
on me at my home. I happened to mention that you lived near here, and
suggested that he might like to see some of your inventions. He agreed,
and we came over in my auto. And now, bless my liver-pin! I find you
about to start off on another trip.

And have you fully decided to go with me? asked Tom. There may be
danger, and I don't like the way that mysterious man behaved.

Oh, bless my revolver! cried Mr. Damon. I'm used to danger by this
time. Of course I'm going, and so is Mr. Parker. Do you know, and the
man, who was always blessing something, came closer to the lad, and
whispered: Do you know, Tom, Mr. Parker is a very peculiar individual.

I'm sure of it, answered the young inventor, looking at the gentleman
in question, who was then inside the airship cabin.

But he's all right, even if he is predicting unpleasant things, went
on Mr. Damon. I think we'll get better acquainted with him after a
bit.

I hope so, agreed Tom, but he did not realize then how close his
companionship with Mr. Parker was to be, nor what dangers they were to
share later.

The friends talked at considerable length of the prospective trip, and
Tom, by this time, had ascertained what needed to be done to the airship
to get it in shape to travel. It would take about a week, and, in the
meanwhile, Mr. Damon would go home and get his affairs in order for
the voyage. Tom's father was introduced to Mr. Parker, and, the former,
finding that the scientist held some views in common with him, invited
the gloomy predictor to remain at the Swift home until the Red Cloud was
ready to sail. Tom could not repress a groan at this, but he decided he
would have to make the best of it.

Mr. Damon left for home that afternoon, promising to be on hand at the
time set to start for Phantom Mountain.

Tom was up waiting for Mr. Jenks at twelve o'clock that night. Shortly
after the hour he saw a dark figure steal into the orchard. At first he
feared lest it might be one of the spies who were, he was now convinced,
on the trail of the man who was seeking to discover the secret of the
diamond makers. But a whistle, which came to the lad's ear a moment
later (that being a signal Mr. Jenks had agreed to sound), told Tom that
it was none other than the visitor he expected.

All right, Mr. Jenks, I'm here, called Tom, cautiously. Come over
this way, and he went out from the shadow of the house, where he had
been waiting, and met the men. We'll go into my private work-shop, the
youth added, leading the way.

Have you decided to go with me? asked Mr. Jenks, in an anxious
whisper. Did you find the diamonds to be real ones?

I did; and I'm going, spoke Tom.

Good! That relieves my mind. But we are still in danger. I was followed
by my shadower to-day, and only succeeded in shaking him off just before
coming here. I don't believe he knows what I am about to do.

Oh, yes he does, said Tom.

He does? How?

Because he was here, and warned me against you!

You don't mean it! Well, they are getting desperate! We must be on our
guard. What sort of a man was he?

Tom described the fellow, and Mr. Jenks stated that this tallied with
the appearance of the person who had been shadowing him.

But we'll fool them yet! cried Tom, who had now fully entered into the
spirit of the affair. If they can follow us in the Red Cloud they're
welcome to. I think we'll get ahead of them.

He then told of Mr. Damon and Mr. Parker, and Mr. Jenks agreed that
it would add to the strength of the party to take these two gentlemen
along.

Though I can't say I care so much for Mr. Parker, he added. But now
as to ways and means. When can we start?

Thereupon he and Tom talked over details in the seclusion of the little
office, and arranged to leave Shopton in about a week. In the meanwhile
the airship would be overhauled, stocked with supplies and provisions,
and be made ready for a swift dash to the mountains.

And now I must be going, said Mr. Jenks. I have a great deal to do
before I can start on this trip, and I hope I am not prevented by any of
those men who seem to be trailing me.

How could they prevent you? Tom wanted to know.

Oh, there are any number of ways, was the answer. But I'm glad you
found that my diamonds were real. We'll soon have plenty, if all goes
well.

As Mr. Jenks left the shop, he started back, in some alarm.

What's the matter? asked Tom.

Over there--I thought I saw a figure sneaking along under the
trees--that man--perhaps--

That's Eradicate, our colored helper, replied Tom, with a laugh.
I posted him there to see that no strangers came into the orchard.
Everything all right, Rad? he asked, raising his voice.

Yais, sah, Massa Tom. Nobody been around yeah this night.

That's good. You can go to bed now, and Eradicate, yawning loudly,
went to his shack. A little later Tom sought his own room, Mr. Jenks
having hurried off to town, where he was boarding.

The next few days saw Tom busily engaged on the airship, making some
changes and a few repairs that were needed. His father, Eradicate and
Mr. Jackson helped him. As for Mr. Parker, the scientist, he went about
the place, being much interested in the various machines which Tom or
Mr. Swift had patented.

At other times the scientist would stroll about the extensive grounds,
making what he said were observations. One afternoon Tom saw him,
apparently much excited, kneeling down back of a shed, with his ear to
the ground.

What is the matter? asked the lad, thinking perhaps Mr. Parker might
be ill.

Have you ever had any earthquakes here, Tom Swift? asked the
scientist, quietly.

Earthquakes? No. We had enough of them on the island.

And you are going to have one here, in about two minutes! cried Mr.
Parker. I predict that this place will be shaken by a tremendous shock
very soon. We had all better get away from the vicinity of buildings.

What makes you think there will be an earthquake? asked Tom.

Because I can hear the rumbling beneath the ground at this very minute.
It is increasing in volume, showing that the tremors are working this
way. There will soon be a great subterranean upheaval! Listen for
yourself.

Tom cast himself down on the grass. Placing his ear close to the ground
he did hear a series of dull thuds. He arose, not a little alarmed.
There had never been any earthquakes in Shopton, yet he had great
respect for Mr. Parker's scientific attainments.

Just then Eradicate Sampson came along. He saw Tom and Mr. Parker lying
flat on the ground, and surprise showed on his honest, black face.

Fo' de land sakes! cried Eradicate. What am de mattah now, Massa
Tom?

Earthquake coming, answered Tom, briefly. Better get away from the
buildings, Rad. They might fall! Tom's face showed the alarm he felt.
What would happen to all of his valuable machines--to the Red Cloud?

Earthquake? murmured Eradicate, and he, too, cast himself down to
listen. A moment later he arose with a laugh.

What's the matter? cried Tom.

Why, dat ain't no earthquake! declared the colored man.

No. Then perhaps you know what it is, said Mr. Parker, somewhat
sharply.

Course I knows what it am, answered Eradicate, with dignity. Dat
noise am my mule Boomerang, kickin' in his stable, on account oh me not
feedin' him yet. Dat's what it am. I'se gwine right now t' gib him his
oats, and den yo' see dat de noise stop. Boomerang allers kick dat way
when he's hungry. I show yo'!

And, sure enough, when Eradicate had gone to the mule's stable,
which was near where Mr. Parker had heard the mysterious sounds, they
immediately ceased.

Dat mule was all de earthquake dere was around here, said the colored
man as he came out.

Mr. Parker walked away, saying nothing, and Tom did not make any
comments--just then.




CHAPTER VIII--OFF FOR THE WEST


It was a great relief to Tom, to find that there was no danger from an
earth tremor. Now that he had made up his mind to go in search of
the diamond makers, he wanted nothing to interfere with it. Lest the
feelings of Mr. Parker might be hurt by the mistake he had made, the
young inventor cautioned Eradicate not to say anything more about the
matter.

'Deed an' I won't, the colored man promised. I'se only too glad dere
wa'n't no earthquake, dat's what I is.

As for Mr. Parker, he did not appear much put out by his error in
predicting.

I am sure that what I heard was a tremor, due to some distant
earthquake shock, he said. The mule's kicking was only a coincidence.

And Tom let him have his way about it. The week was drawing to a close,
and the Red Cloud was nearly in shape for the voyage. At almost the
last minute Tom found that he needed some electrical apparatus for the
airship, and as he had to go to Chester for it, he decided he would make
the trip in his monoplane, and, while in the city, would also get the
diamond pin he was having made for Mary Nestor.

He started off early one morning, in the swift little craft Butterfly,
and soon had reached Chester. The diamond brooch was ready for him.

It is one of the most beautiful stones we have ever set, the diamond
merchant told him. Don't forget, if you find any more, Mr. Swift, to
let us have a chance to bid on them.

I may, Tom promised, rather indefinitely. Then, having purchased his
electrical supplies, he made a quick trip to Shopton, stopping on the
way to call on Miss Nestor.

Why Tom, I'm delighted to see you! cried the girl, blushing prettily.
Did you come for some apple turnovers? and she laughed, as she
referred to a call Tom had once paid, when a new cook had been engaged,
and when the pastry formed a feature of the meal.

No turnovers this time, said the young inventor. I came to wish you
many happy returns of the day.

Oh, you remembered my birthday! How nice of you!

And here is something else, added our hero, rather awkwardly, as he
handed her the diamond pin.

Oh, Tom! This for me! Oh, it's too lovely--it's far too much!

It isn't half enough! he declared, warmly.

Oh, what a large diamond! Mary cried as she saw the sparkling stone.
I never saw one so large and beautiful!

It's just as easy to make them large as small, explained Tom.

Make them? she looked the surprise she felt.

Yes, I'm about to start for the place where diamonds are made.

Oh, Tom! But isn't it dangerous? I mean won't you have to go to some
far country--like Africa--to get to where diamonds are made?

Well, we are going on quite a trip, but not as far as that. And as
for the danger--well, we'll have to take what comes, and he told her
something of the proposed quest.

Oh, it sounds--sounds scary! Mary exclaimed, when she had heard of Mr.
Jenks' experience. Do be careful, Tom!

I will, he promised, and, somehow he was glad that she had cautioned
him thus--and in such tones as she had used. For Mary Nestor was a girl
that any young chap would have been glad to have manifest an interest in
him.

Well, I guess I'll have to say good-by, spoke Tom, at length. We
expect to start in a couple of days, and I may not get another chance to
see you.

Oh, I--I hope you come back safely, faltered Mary, and then she held
out her hand, and Tom--well, it's none of our affair what Tom did
after that, except to say that he hurried out, fairly jumped into his
monoplane, and completed the trip home.

As the Red Cloud has been fully described in the volume entitled Tom
Swift and His Airship, we will not go into details about it now.
Sufficient to say that it was a combination of a biplane and dirigible
balloon. It could be used either as one or the other, and the gas-bag
feature was of value when the wind was too great to allow the use of the
planes, or when the motive power, for some reason stopped. In that event
the airship could remain suspended far above the clouds if necessary.
There was provision for manufacturing the gas on board.

The Red Cloud was fitted up to accommodate about ten persons, though it
was seldom that this number was carried. Two persons could successfully
operate the machinery. There were sleeping berths, and in the main cabin
a sitting-room, a dining-room, and a kitchen. There was also the motor
compartment, and a steering tower, from which the engines could be
controlled.

It was in this craft that the seekers after the diamond makers proposed
undertaking the trip. Mr. Damon came on from his home in Waterfield
about two days before the date set to leave, and Mr. Jenks, had, three
days before this, taken up his abode at the Swift home. Mr. Parker, as
has been stated, was already there, and he had put in his time making
a number of scientific observations, though he had made no more
predictions.

Nothing more had been seen of the mysterious man who had warned Tom,
and the young inventor and Mr. Jenks began to hope that they had thrown
their enemies off the track.

Though I don't imagine they'll give up altogether, said Mr. Jenks.
They're too desperate for that. We'll have trouble with them yet.

Well, it can't be helped, decided Tom. We'll try and be ready for it,
when it comes, and then, dismissing the matter from his mind, he busied
himself about the airship.

The food and supplies had all been put aboard, and they expected to
start the next morning. In order to make sure that any stones which they
might succeed in getting from the diamond makers were real gems, a set
of testing apparatus was taken along. Mr. Parker had had some experience
in this line, and, in spite of the fact that he might make direful
predictions, Tom was rather glad, after all, that the scientist was
going to accompany them.

But what is worrying me, said Mr. Damon, is what we are going to do
after we get to Phantom Mountain. What are your plans, Mr. Jenks? Will
you go in, and demand your share of the diamond-making business?

I have a right to it, as I invested a large sum in it, and I am
entitled to more than a half-share. But, of course, I can't say what
I'll do until I get there. We may have to act very secretly.

I'm inclined to think we will, said Tom. My plan would be to gain
access to the cave, if possible, and watch them at work. We might be
able to discover the secret of making diamonds, and, after all, that's
what you want, isn't it, Mr. Jenks?

Yes, I paid my money for the secret, and I ought to have it. If I can
get it quietly, so much the better. If not, I'll fight for my rights!
 and he looked very determined.

Bless my powder horn! cried Mr. Damon. That's the way to talk! And
so we're to go cruising about in the air, looking for a mountain shaped
like a man's head.

That's it, agreed Mr. Jenks, and when we find it we will be near
Phantom Mountain, and the diamond makers.

The final details were completed that night. The last of the supplies
had been put aboard, the larder was well stocked, the diamond testing
apparatus was stored safely away, and all that remained was for the
adventurers to board the Red Cloud in the morning, and soar away.

That night Tom was uneasy. Several times he got up, and looked toward
the shed where the airship was stored. He could not rid himself of
the idea that the men to whose interest it was that the diamond-making
secret remain undiscovered, might attempt to wreck the airship before
the start. Consequently both Eradicate Sampson and Engineer Jackson were
on guard. Tom looked from his window, to the shed where the Red Cloud
was housed. He saw nothing to cause him any uneasiness.

I guess I'm just nervous, he mused. But, all the same, I'll be glad
when we've started.

They were all up early the next morning, Mr. Damon beginning the day by
blessing the sunrise, and many other things that struck his fancy.
The airship was wheeled out of the shed, and Tom gave her a final
inspection.

It's all right, he declared. All aboard!

Now, do be careful, begged Mr. Swift. Don't take too many chances,
Tom.

I'll not.

The adventurers were in the forward part of the ship, and Tom had taken
his place at the wheels and levers in the pilot house. As he was about
to start the motor he looked toward the road, and saw a horse and
carriage. In the vehicle was a girlish figure, at the sight of which Tom
blushed and smiled. He waved his hand.

I came to wish you good luck! cried Mary Nestor, for it was she in the
carriage.

Thanks! cried Tom, leaning from the window of the pilot house. It was
good of you to get up so early.

Oh. I'm always up early, she informed him.

Look out that the motor doesn't scare your horse, Tom warned her.

Old Dobbin doesn't mind anything, was her answer. I'll see that he
doesn't run away with me, as long as you're not on earth to rescue me.
Good-by, Tom!

Good-by! he called, and then he pulled the lever that set in motion
the motor, and whirled the great propellers about. They whizzed around
with a roar, and the Red Cloud, shivering and trembling with the
vibration, rose in the air like some great bird.

We're off for the West and Phantom Mountain! called Tom to his
companions.

As the airship soared upward, Eradicate Sampson ran forward from where
he had been standing near his mule Boomerang. He waved his hands, and
shouted something.

Bless my hatband! What does he want? asked Mr. Damon, watching him
curiously.

It sounds as if he were calling to us to come back, spoke Mr. Parker.

It's too late now, decided Tom. Maybe he forgot to tell us good-by,
 but, he felt a vague wonder at Eradicate's odd motions; for the colored
man was pointing toward the stern of the airship, as if there was
something wrong there. But the Red Cloud soared on.




CHAPTER IX--A WARNING BY WIRELESS


Rapidly the airship ascended, and, when it was high over the town of
Shopton, Tom headed the craft due west. Looking down he tried to descry
Mary Nestor, in her carriage, but the trees were in the way, their
interlocking branches hiding the girl. Tom did see crowds of other
persons, though, thronging the streets of Shopton, for, though the young
inventor had made many flights, there was always a novelty about them,
that brought out the curious.

A good start, Tom Swift, complimented Mr. Parker. Is it always as
easy as this?

Starting always is, was the answer, though, as the Irishman said,
coming down isn't sometimes quite so comfortable.

Bless my gizzard! That's so, cried the eccentric Mr. Damon. Can we
vol-plane to earth in the Red Cloud, Tom?

Yes, but not as easily as in the Butterfly. However I hope we will not
have to. Now, Mr. Damon, if you will just take charge of the steering
apparatus for a minute, I want to go aft.

What for?

I wish to see if everything is all right. I can't imagine why Eradicate
was making those queer motions.

Mr. Damon, who knew how to operate the Red Cloud, was soon guiding her
on the course, while Tom made his way to the rear compartments, through
the motor room, where the stores of supplies and food were kept. He made
a careful examination, looking from an after window, and even going out
on a small, open platform, but could discover nothing wrong.

I guess Rad was just capering about without any special object, mused
Tom, but it was not long after this that they learned to their dismay,
that the colored man had had a method in his madness.

On his way back through the motor room Tom looked to the machinery,
and adjusted some of the auxiliary oil feeders. The various pieces of
apparatus were working well, though the engine had not yet been speeded
up to its limit. Tom wanted it to warm-up first.

Everything all right? asked Mr. Damon, as Tom rejoined them in the
pilot house, which was just forward of the living room in the main
cabin.

Yes, I can't imagine what made Rad act that way. But I'll set the
automatic steering gear now, Mr. Damon, and then you will be relieved.

Mr. Jenks was gazing off toward the west--to where he hoped to discover
the secret of Phantom Mountain.

How do you like it? asked Tom.

It's great, replied the diamond man. I've never been in an airship
before, and it's different than what I expected; but it's great! It's
the only craft that will serve our purpose among the towering mountain
peaks, where the diamond makers are hidden. I hope we can find them.

In a little while the Red Cloud was skimming along at faster speed,
guided by the automatic rudders, so that no one was needed in the pilot
house, since there was no danger of collisions. Airships are not quite
numerous enough for that, yet, though they may soon become so.

Tom and the others devoted several hours to arranging their staterooms
and bunks, and getting their clothing stowed away, and when this was
done Mr. Parker and Mr. Jenks sat gazing off into space.

It's hard to realize that we are really in an airship, observed the
diamond man. At first I thought I would be frightened, but I'm not a
bit. It doesn't seem as if anything could happen.

Something is likely to happen soon, said Mr. Parker, suddenly, as he
gazed at some weather instruments on the cabin wall.

Bless my soul! Don't say that! cried Mr. Damon. What is it?

I think, from my observations, that we will soon have a hurricane,
 said the scientific man. There is every indication of it; and he
seemed quite delighted at the prospect of his prediction coming true.

A hurricane! cried Mr. Damon. I hope it isn't like the one that blew
us to Earthquake Island.

Oh, I think there will be no danger, spoke Tom. If it comes on to
blow we will ascend or descend out of the path of the storm. This craft
is not like the ill-fated Whizzer. I can more easily handle the Red
Cloud; even in a bad storm.

I'm glad to hear that, remarked Mr. Jenks. It would be too bad to be
wrecked before we got to Phantom Mountain.

Well, I predict that we will have a bad storm, insisted Mr. Parker,
and Tom could not help wishing that the scientist would keep his gloomy
forebodings to himself.

However the storm had not developed up to noon, when Tom, with Mr.
Damon's help, served a fine meal in the dining-room. In the afternoon
the speed of the ship was increased, and by night they had covered
several hundred miles. Through the darkness the Red Cloud kept on,
making good time. Tom got up, occasionally, to look to the machinery,
but it was all automatically controlled, and an alarm bell would sound
in his stateroom when anything went wrong.

Bless my napkin! exclaimed Mr. Damon the next morning, as they sat
down to a breakfast of fruit, ham and eggs and fragrant coffee, this is
living as well as in a hotel, and yet we are--how far are we above the
earth, Tom? he asked, turning to the young inventor.

About two miles now. I just sent her up, as I thought I detected that
storm Mr. Parker spoke of.

I told you it would come, declared the scientist, and there was a
small hurricane below them that morning, but only the lower edge of it
caught the Red Cloud, and when Tom sent her up still higher she found a
comparatively quiet zone, where she slid along at good speed.

That afternoon Tom busied himself about some wires and a number of
complicated pieces of apparatus which were in one corner of the main
cabin.

What are you doing now? asked Mr. Jenks, who had been talking with Mr.
Parker, and showing that scientist some of the manufactured diamonds.

Getting our wireless apparatus in shape, answered the lad. I should
have done it before, but I had so much to do that I couldn't get at it.
I'm going to send off some messages. Dad will want to know how we are
doing.

As he worked away, he also made up his mind to send another message, in
care of his father, for there was a receiving station in the Swift home.
And to whom this message was addressed Tom did not say, but we fancy
some of our readers can guess.

Finally, after several hours of work, the wireless was in shape to send
and receive messages. Tom pulled over the lever, and a crackling sound
was heard, as the electricity leaped from the transmitters into space.
Then he clamped the receiver on his ear.

All ready, he announced. Has anybody any messages they wish sent?
 For, with the courtesy of a true host he was ready to serve his guests
before he forwarded his own wireless notes.

Just tell my wife that I'm enjoying myself, requested Mr. Damon.
Bless my footstool! But this is great! We're off the earth yet,
connected with it.

Mr. Jenks had no one to whom he wanted to send any word, but Mr. Parker
wish to wire to a fellow scientist the result of some observations made
in the upper air.

Tom noted all the messages down, and then, when all was in readiness he
began to call his home station. He knew that either his father or Mr.
Jackson, the engineer, could receive the wireless.

But, no sooner had the young inventor sent off the first few dots and
dashes representing S. I.--his home station call--than he started and
a look of surprise came over his face.

They're calling us! he exclaimed.

Who is? asked Mr. Jenks.

My house--my father. He--he's been trying to get us ever since we
started, but I didn't have the wireless in shape to receive messages.
Oh, I hope it's not too late!

Too late! Bless my soul, too late for what? gasped Mr. Damon, somewhat
alarmed by Tom's manner.

The lad did not answer at once. He was intently listening to a series
of dots and dashes that clicked in the telephone receiver clamped to his
left ear. On his face there was a look of worriment.

Father has just sent me a message, he said. It's a warning flashed
through space! He's been trying to get it to me since yesterday!

What is it? asked Mr. Jenks, rising from his seat.

The mysterious man is aboard the airship--hidden away! cried Tom.
That's what Eradicate was trying to call to our attention as we started
off. Eradicate saw his face at a rear window, and tried to warn us! The
mysterious man is a stowaway on board!




CHAPTER X--DROPPING THE STOWAWAY


Tom's excited announcement startled Mr. Damon and the others as much as
if the young inventor had informed them that the airship had exploded
and was about to dash with them to the earth. The men leaped to their
feet, and stared at the lad.

A stowaway on board! cried Mr. Damon. Bless my soul! How did he--

Are you sure that message is straight? asked Mr. Jenks. Did Eradicate
see the man?

He says he did, answered Tom. The man is hidden away on board
now--probably among the stores and supplies.

Bless my tomato sauce! exploded Mr. Damon. I hope he doesn't eat them
all up!

We must get him out at once! declared Mr. Jenks.

I knew something would happen on this voyage, came from Mr. Parker. I
predicted it from the first!

Tom thought considerable, but he did not answer the scientist just
then. Another communication was coming to him by wireless. He listened
intently.

Father says, the lad told his companions that Eradicate only had
a glimpse of the man at the last moment. He was looking from the rear
storeroom window--he's the same man who called on me that time--Rad
remembers him very well.

Bless my shoes! What's to be done? inquired Mr. Damon, looking around
helplessly.

We must get him out, that's all, decided Mr. Jenks; with vigor. Get
him out and drop him overboard!

Drop him overboard! cried Mr. Parker, in horror.

Not exactly, but get rid of him, proceeded the diamond seeker. That
man is one of my enemies. He has been sent by the band of diamond makers
hidden among the mountains, to spy on me, and, if possible, prevent me
from seeking to discover their secret. He tried to work on Tom's Swift's
fears, and frighten him from using his airship on this quest. Then, when
he failed, the man must have sneaked into the shed, and hidden himself
in the ship. We must get rid of him, or he may wreck the Red Cloud!

That's so! cried Tom. We must try to capture him. I think we had
better-- the lad paused, and again listened to the wireless message.
Father says Eradicate saw the man have a gun, so we must be careful,
 the young inventor translated the dots and dashes.

Bless my powder horn! exploded Mr. Damon.

We shall have to proceed cautiously then, spoke Mr. Jenks. If he is
like any others in the gang he is a desperate man.

Better sneak up on him then, if we can, proposed Mr. Parker. There
are enough of us to cope with one man, even if he is armed. You have
weapons aboard, haven't you? he inquired of Tom.

Yes, was the hesitating answer, but I don't want to use them if I
can help it. Not only because of the danger, and a dislike of shedding
blood, but because a stray bullet might pierce the gas bag and damage
the ship.

That's so, agreed Mr. Jenks. Well, I guess if we go at it the right
way we can capture him without any shooting. But we must talk more
quietly--we ought to have whispered--he may have heard us.

I don't think so, replied Tom. The storeroom is far enough off so
that he couldn't hear us. Besides, the motor makes such a racket that
he couldn't distinguish what we were talking about, even if he heard our
voices. So, unless he heard the wireless working, and suspects something
from that, he probably doesn't know that we are aware of his presence
aboard.

But why do you think he has remained quiet all this while, Tom? asked
Mr. Damon.

Probably he wants to wait until the ship is farther out west,
 suggested Mr. Jenks. Then he will be nearer his friends, and can get
help, if he needs it.

And do you really believe he would destroy the Red Cloud? asked Mr.
Parker.

I think that all he is waiting for is a favorable chance, declared
the diamond seeker. He would destroy the craft, and us too, if he could
prevent us from discovering the secret of Phantom Mountain, I believe.

Then we must get ahead of him, decided Tom, quietly. I have just
flashed to dad a message, telling him that we will heed his warning. Now
to capture the stowaway!

And while we're about it, give him a good scare when we do get him,
 suggested Mr. Jenks.

How? asked Tom.

Threaten to drop him overboard. Perhaps that will make him tell how
he happened to get in our ship, and what are the plans of the gang of
diamond makers. We may get valuable information that way.

I don't believe you can scare such fellows much, was Tom's opinion,
but it was agreed to try.

How are you going to capture him? asked Mr. Parker. If he has a gun
it won't be any too easy to go in the storeroom, and drag him out.

We'll have to use a little strategy, decided Tom, and then they
discussed several plans. The one finally adopted was that Tom and Mr.
Damon should enter the storeroom, casually, as if in search of food to
cook for supper. They would discuss various dishes, and Mr. Damon was to
express a preference for something in the food line, the box containing
which, was well back in the room. This would give the two a chance
to penetrate to the far end of the apartment, without arousing the
suspicions of the hidden man, who, doubtless, would be listening to the
conversation.

And as soon as we get sight of him, you and I will jump right at him,
Mr. Damon, said Tom. Jump before he has a chance to use his gun. Mr.
Jenks and Mr. Parker will be waiting outside the room, to catch him if
he gets away from us. I'll have some ropes ready, and we'll tie him up,
and--well, we'll decide later what to do with him.

All right. I'm ready as soon as you are, Tom, said the eccentric man.
Come ahead.

They went softly to the storeroom, and listened at the door. There was
no sound heard save that made by the machinery.

I wonder if he's really here? whispered Mr. Damon.

We'll soon find out, answered Tom. Let's go in.

They entered, and, in pursuance of their plan, Tom and his friend talked
of various foods.

I think I'd like some of that canned lobster, with French dressing on,
 spoke the eccentric man.

That's away in the back end of the room, said Tom, in a loud voice.
It's under a lot of boxes.

Then I'll help you get it out! Bless my frying pan! but I am very fond
of lobster! exclaimed Mr. Damon, in as natural tones as was possible
under the circumstances.

He and Tom moved cautiously back among the boxes and barrels. They were
glancing about with eager eyes. Tom switched on an electric light, and,
the instant he did so, he was aware of a movement in a little space
formed by one box which was placed on top, of two others. The lad saw a
dark figure moving, as if to get farther out of sight.

I've got him! cried Tom, making a dive for the shadow.

A moment later the young inventor was bowled over, as a dark figure
leaped over his head.

Catch him, Mr. Damon! he cried.

Bless my hatband! I--I-- Mr. Damon's voice ended in a grunt. He, too,
had been knocked down by the fleeing man.

Look out, Mr. Jenks! cried Tom, to warn those on guard at the door of
the storeroom.

There was the report of a gun, some excited shouts, and when Tom could
scramble to his feet, and rush out, he beheld Mr. Parker calmly sitting
on a struggling man, while Mr. Jenks held a gun, that was still smoking.

We caught him! cried the scientist.

Anybody hurt? asked Tom, anxiously.

No, I knocked up his gun as he fired, explained Mr. Jenks. Where are
the ropes, Tom?

The cords were produced and the man, who had now ceased to struggle,
was tightly bound. He uttered not a word, but he smiled grimly when Mr.
Damon remarked:

I guess I'll go back in the storeroom, Tom, and see how much food he
ate.

Oh, I guess he didn't take much, declared the lad. He wasn't there
long enough.

Well, Farley Munson, so it's you, is it? asked Mr. Jenks, as he
surveyed the prisoner.

Do you know him? asked Tom, in some surprise.

He was in with the diamond makers, said Mr. Jenks. He was one of
those who took me to the secret cave. But it will be the last time he
ever goes there. How high up are we, Tom?

About two miles. Why?

I guess that will be far enough to let him fall, went on the diamond
seeker. Come on, Mr. Damon, help me throw him overboard!

You--you're not going to throw me over--with the airship two miles
high; are you? gasped the man.

Will you tell us what we want to know, if we don't? asked Mr. Jenks.

What do you want to know?

How you got aboard, and what your object was in coming.

That's easy enough. I had been hanging around the shed for several
days, watching a chance to get in. Finally I saw it, when that colored
man went to feed his mule, and I slipped in, and hid in the airship. The
stores were all in then, and I stowed myself away among the boxes. I had
food and water, so I didn't touch any of yours, and he looked at Mr.
Damon, who seemed much relieved.

And what was your object? demanded Mr. Jenks.

I wanted to prevent you from going to Phantom Mountain.

How?

By destroying the airship if need be. But I hoped to accomplish it by
other means. I would have stopped at nothing, though, to prevent you.
You must keep away from there!

And if we refuse? asked Tom.

Then you'll have to take what comes!

But not from you! exclaimed Mr. Jenks. We're going to get rid of
you.

The man's face showed the alarm he felt.

Oh, don't worry, said Mr. Jenks, quickly, we're not going to toss you
overboard. We're not as desperate as your crowd. But we're going to
get rid of you, and then go on before you can send any word to your
confederates. We'll put you off in the most lonesome spot we can find,
and I guess you'll be some time getting back to civilization. By that
time we'll have the secret of the diamonds.

You never will! declared the man, firmly. And he would say nothing
more, though by threats and promises Mr. Jenks tried to get from him
something about the men in with him, and where the cave of the diamonds
was located.

Heavily bound with ropes the man was locked in a small closet, to be
kept there until a favorable spot was reached for letting him go. Mr.
Jenks' plan, of dropping him down in some place where he would have
difficulty in sending on word to his confederates was considered a good
one.

Three days later, in crossing over a lonely region, near the Nebraska
National Forest, Farley Munson, which was one of the names the spy went
by, was dropped off the airship, when it was sent down to within a few
feet of the earth.

It will take you some time to get to a telegraph office, said Mr.
Jenks, as a package of food, and a flask of water was tossed down to the
stowaway. He shook his fist at those in the airship, and shouted after
them:

You'll never discover the secret of Phantom Mountain!

Yes, we will, declared Tom, as he sent the Red Cloud high into the air
again.



CHAPTER XI--A WEARY SEARCH


During the three days when the stowaway had been kept a prisoner, the
Red Cloud had made good time on her western trip. She was now about two
hundred and fifty miles from Leadville, Colorado, and Tom knew he could
accomplish that distance in a short time. It was necessary, therefore,
since they were so close to the place where the real search would begin,
to make some more definite plans.

We will need to replenish our supply of gasoline, said Tom, shortly
after the stowaway had been dropped, and when the young inventor had
made a general inspection of the airship.

Is it all gone? inquired Mr. Damon.

Not all, but we will soon be in the wildest part of the Rocky
Mountains, and gasoline is difficult to procure there. So I want to fill
all our reserve tanks. But I would rather do that before we get far into
Colorado.

Why? inquired Mr. Parker.

Because airships are not so common but what the appearance of one
attracts attention. Ours is sure to be talked about, and commented on.
In that case, in spite of our precaution in putting Munson off in this
lonely place, word of the Red Cloud being in the vicinity of Leadville
may reach the diamond makers, and put them on their guard. We want to
take them unawares if we can.

That's so, agreed Mr. Jenks. We had better get our gasoline at the
first stopping place, then, and proceed with our search. Our first
object ought to be to look for the landmark--the head of stone. Then we
can begin to prospect about a bit.

My idea, exactly, declared Tom. Well, then, I'll go down at the
first place we cross, where we can get gasoline, and then we'll be in a
position to hover in the air for a long time, without descending.

The airship kept on her way, traveling slowly the remainder of that day,
and at dusk, when there was less chance of big crowds seeing them, the
Red Cloud was sent down on the outskirts of a large village. Tom and Mr.
Damon went to a supply store, and arranged to have a sufficient quantity
of the gasoline taken out to the airship. It was delivered after dark,
and little talk was occasioned by the few who were aware of the presence
of the craft. Then, once more, they went aloft, and Tom sent several
wireless messages to Shopton, including one to Miss Nestor.

Please tell my wife that I am well, and that I have a good appetite,
 said Mr. Damon.

Mr. Parker also sent a message to a scientific friend of his, stating
that he made some observations among the mountains, of the region in
which the airship then was, and that the indications were that a great
landslide would soon take place.

That won't worry us, spoke Tom, for we'll be far above it.

I hope we will be near enough to enable me to observe it, and make
some scientific notes, came from Mr. Parker. I am positive that one
of these mountain peaks that we saw to-day will disappear in a landslide
within a few days. I have an instrument somewhat like the one that
records earthquakes, and it has been acting strangely of late.

Tom wondered what enjoyment Mr. Parker got out of life, when he was
always looking for some calamity to happen, but the scientist seemed
to take as much pleasure in his gloomy forebodings now, as he had on
Earthquake Island.

They reached the vicinity of Leadville the next day, but took care to
keep high above the city, so that the airship could not be observed.
With powerful glasses they examined the mountainous country, looking for
the little settlement of Indian Ridge.

There it is! exclaimed Mr. Jenks, just as dusk was settling down. I
can make out the hotel I stopped at. Now we can really begin our search.
The next thing is to find the stone head, and then, I think, I will have
my bearings.

We'll begin the hunt for that landmark in the morning, said Tom.

High in the air hovered the Red Cloud. At that distance above the earth
she must have looked like some great bird, and the adventurers thought
it unlikely that any one in the vicinity of Leadville would observe
them.

The quest for the great mountain peak, that looked like a stone head,
was under way. Back and forth sailed the airship. Sometimes she was
enveloped in fog, and no sight could be had of the earth below. At
other times there were rain storms, which likewise prevented a view. Mr.
Parker was on the lookout for his predicted mountain landslide, but it
did not occur, and he was much disappointed.

It's queer I can't pick out that landmark, said Mr. Jenks after two
days of weary searching, when their eyes were strained from long peering
through telescopes. I'm sure it was around Indian Ridge, yet we've
covered almost all the ground in this neighborhood, and I haven't had a
glimpse of it.

Perhaps it was destroyed in a landslide, or some cataclysm of nature,
 suggested Mr. Parker. That is very possible.

If that's the case we're going to have a hard time to locate the cave
of the diamond makers, answered Mr. Jenks, but I hope it isn't so.

They continued the search for another day, and then Tom, as they sat
in the comfortable cabin of the airship that night, hovering almost
motionless (for the motor had been shut down) made a proposition.

Why not descend in some secluded place, he suggested, and wander
around on foot, making inquiries of the miners. They may know where the
stone head is, or they may even know about Phantom Mountain.

Good idea, spoke Mr. Jenks. We'll do it.

Accordingly, the next morning, the Red Cloud was lowered in a good but
lonely landing place, and securely moored. It was in a valley, well
screened from observation, and the craft was not likely to be seen,
but, to guard against any damage being done to it by passing hunters or
miners, Mr. Parker and Mr. Damon agreed to remain on guard in it, while
Tom and Mr. Jenks spent a day or two traveling around, making inquiries.

The young inventor and his companion proceeded on foot to a small
settlement, where they hired horses on which to make their way about.
They were to be gone two days, and in that time they hoped to get on the
right trail.




CHAPTER XII--THE GREAT STONE HEAD


It was a wild and desolate country in which Tom Swift and Mr. Jenks
were traveling. Villages were far apart, and they were at best but
small settlements. In their journeys from place to place they met few
travelers.

But of these few they made cautious inquiries as to the location
of Phantom Mountain, or the landmark known as the great stone head.
Prospectors, miners and hunters, whom they asked, shook their heads.

I've heard of Phantom Mountain, said one grizzled miner, but I
couldn't say where it is. Maybe it's only a fish story--the place may
not even exist.

Oh, it does, for I've been there! exclaimed Mr. Jenks.

Then why don't you go back to it? asked the miner.

Because I can't locate it again, was the reply.

Humph! Mighty queer if you've seen a place once, and can't get to it
again, and the man looked as if he thought there was something strange
about Tom and his companion. Mr. Jenks did not want to say that he had
been taken to the mountain blindfolded, for that would have caused too
much talk.

I think if we spent to-night in a place where the miners congregate,
listened to their talk, and put a few casual questions to them, more as
if we were only asking out of idle curiosity, we might learn something,
 suggested Tom.

Very well, we'll try that scheme.

Accordingly, after they had left the suspicious miner the two proceeded
to a small milling town, not far from Indian Ridge. There they engaged
rooms for the night at the only hotel, and, after supper they sat around
the combined dance hall and gambling place.

There were wild, rough scenes, which were distasteful to Tom, and to Mr.
Jenks, but they felt that this was their only chance to get on the right
trail, and so they stayed. As strangers in a western mining settlement
they were made roughly welcome, and in response to their inquiries about
the country, they were told many tales, some of which were evidently
gotten up for the benefit of the tenderfeet.

Is there a place around here called Phantom Mountain? asked Tom, at
length, as quietly as he could.

Never heard of it, stranger, replied a miner who had done most of the
talking. I never heard of it, and what Bill Slatterly don't know ain't
worth knowin'. I'm Bill Slatterly, he added, lest there be some doubt
on that score.

Isn't there some sort of a landmark around here shaped like a great
stone head? went on Tom, after some unimportant questions. Seems to me
I've heard of that.

Nary a one, answered Mr. Slatterly. No stone heads, and no Phantom
Mountains--nary a one.

Who says there ain't no Phantom Mountains? demanded an elderly miner,
who had been dozing in one corner of the room, but who was awakened by
Slatterly's loud voice. Who says so?

I do, answered the one who claimed to know everything.

Then you're wrong! Tom's heart commenced beating faster than usual.

Do you mean to say you've seen Phantom Mountain, Jed Nugg? demanded
Slatterly.

No, I ain't exactly seen it, an' I don't want to, but there is such
a place, about sixty mile from here. Folks says it's haunted, and them
sort of places I steer clear from.

Can you tell me about it? asked Mr. Jenks, eagerly. I am interested
in such things.

I can't tell you much about it, was the reply, and I wouldn't git too
interested, if I was you. It might not be healthy. All I know is that
one time my partner and I were in hard luck. We got grub-staked, and
went out prospectin'. We strayed into a wild part of the country about
sixty mile from here, and one night we camped on a mountain--a wild,
desolate place it was too.

The miner stopped, and began leisurely filling his pipe.

Well? asked Tom, trying not to let his voice sound too eager.

Well, that was Phantom Mountain.

The miner seemed to have finished his story.

Is that all? asked Mr. Jenks. How did you know it was Phantom
Mountain?

'Cause we seen the ghost--my partner and I--that's why! exclaimed the
man, puffing on his pipe. As I said, we was campin' there, and 'long
about midnight we seen somethin' tall and white, and all shimmerin',
with a sort of yellow fire, slidin' down the side of the mountain. It
made straight for our camp.

Huh! Guess you run, didn't you, Jed? asked Bill Slatterly.

Course we did. You'd a run too, if you seen a ghost comm' at you, an'
firin' a gun.

Ghosts can't fire guns! declared Bill. I guess you dreamed it, Jed.

Ghosts can't fire guns, eh? That's all you know about it. This one did,
and to prove I didn't dream it, there was a bullet hole in my hat next
mornin'. I could prove it, too, only I ain't got that hat any more. But
that was Phantom Mountain, strangers, an' my advice to you is to keep
away from it. I was on it but I didn't exactly see it, 'cause it was
dark at the time.

Was it near a peak that looked like a stone head? asked Tom.

It were, stranger, but I didn't take much notice of it. Me and my
partner got out of them diggin's next day, and I never went back. I
ain't never said much about this place, but it's called Phantom Mountain
all right, and I ain't the only one that's seen a ghost there. Other
grub-stakers has had the same experience.

Why ain't I never heard about it? demanded Bill, suspiciously.

'Cause as why you're allers so busy talkin' that you don't never listen
to nothin' I reckon, was Jed's answer, amid laughter.

Can you tell us what trail to take to get there? asked Tom, of the
miner.

Yes, it's called the old silver trail, and you strike it by goin' to a
place called Black Gulch, about forty mile from here. Then it's twenty
mile farther on. But take my advice and don't go.

Can it be reached by way of Indian Ridge? asked Mr. Jenks, wondering
how he had been taken to the cave of the diamond makers. He did not
remember Black Gulch.

Yes, you can git there by Indian Ridge way, but it's more dangerous.
You're likely to lose your way, for that's a trail that's seldom
traveled. Mr. Jenks thought that, perhaps, was the reason the gang had
taken him that way. It's easier to get to the stone head and Phantom
Mountain by Black Gulch, but it ain't healthy to go there, strangers,
take my advice on that, concluded the miner, as he prepared to go to
sleep again.

Tom could scarcely contain the exultation he felt. At last, it seemed,
they were on the trail. He motioned to Mr. Jenks, and they slipped
quietly from the place, just as another dance was beginning.

Now for Black Gulch! cried Tom. We must hurry back to the airship,
and tell the good news.

It's too late to-night, decided Mr. Jenks, and so they waited until
morning, when they made an early start.

They found Mr. Damon and Mr. Parker anxiously awaiting their return. Mr.
Damon blessed so many things that he was nearly out of breath, and Mr.
Parker related something of the observations he had made.

I think I have discovered traces of a dormant volcano, he said. I am
in hopes that it will have an eruption while we are here.

I'm not, spoke Tom, decidedly. We'll start for Black Gulch as soon as
possible.

The airship once more rose in the air, and, following the directions
the miner had given him, Tom pointed his craft for the depression in the
mountains which had been given the name Black Gulch. It was reached in
a short time, and then, making a turn up a long valley the airship
proceeded at reduced speed.

We ought to see that stone head soon now, spoke Tom, as he peered from
the windows of the pilot house.

It's queer we didn't notice it when we were up in the air, remarked
Mr. Jenks. We've been over this place before, I'm sure of it.

The next moment Mr. Damon uttered a cry. Bless my watch-chain! he
exclaimed. Look at that!

He pointed off to the left. There, jutting out from the side of a steep
mountain peak was a mass of stone--black stone--which, as the airship
slowly approached, took the form and shape of a giant's head.

That's it! That's it! cried Tom. The great stone head!

And now for Phantom Mountain and the diamonds! shouted Mr. Jenks, as
Tom let the airship slowly settle to the bottom of the valley.




CHAPTER XIII--ON PHANTOM MOUNTAIN


Out from the Red Cloud piled Tom and the others. They made a rush for
the irregular mass of rock which bore so strong a resemblance to the
head of some gigantic man.

That's the one! That's the thing I saw when they were taking me along
here blindfolded! exclaimed Mr. Jenks. I'm sure we're on the right
trail, now!

But what gets me, though, remarked Mr. Damon, is why we couldn't see
that landmark when we were up in the air. We had a fine view, and ought
to have been able to pick it out with the telescopes.

The adventurers saw the reason a few seconds later. The image was
visible only from one place, and that was directly looking up the
valley. If one went too far to the right or left the head disappeared
from view behind jutting crags, and it was impossible to see it from
overhead, because the head was almost under a great spur of a mighty
mountain.

We might have hunted for it a week in the airship, and been directly
over it, said Tom, and yet we would never have seen it.

Yes, but we never would have gotten here in such good shape if it
hadn't been for your wonderful craft, declared Mr. Jenks. It brought
us here safely and quickly, and enabled us to elude the men who tried to
keep us back. We're here in spite of them. If we had traveled by train
they might have interfered with us in a dozen ways.

That's so, agreed Mr. Damon. Well, now we're here, what's to be
done? Which way do we start to reach the cave where the diamonds are
manufactured, Mr. Jenks?

That I can't say. As you know, I only had a momentary glimpse of this
stone head as they were taking me along the trail. Then one of the men
noticed that the bandage had slipped and he pulled it into place. So I
really can't say which direction to take now, in order to discover the
secret.

How long after you saw the head before you reached the cave? asked
Tom. In that way we may be able to tell how far away it is.

Well, I should say it was about two or three hours after I saw the
head, before we got to the halting place, and I was carried into the
cave. That would make it several miles from here, for we went in a
wagon.

Yes, and they might have driven in a round-about way, in order to
deceive you, suggested Mr. Damon. At best we have but a faint idea
where the diamond cave is, but we must search for it; eh, Tom?

Certainly. We'll start right in. And as the airship will be of but
little service to us now, I suggest that we leave it in this valley.
It is very much secluded, and no one will harm it, I think. We can then
start off prospecting, for I have a large portable tent, and we can
carry enough food with us, with what game we can shoot, to enable us to
live. I have a regular camping outfit on board.

Fine! cried Mr. Parker, and that will give me a chance to make some
observations among the mountains, and perhaps I can predict when a
landslide, or an eruption of some dormant volcano, may occur.

Bless my stars! cried Mr. Damon. I don't wish you any bad luck, Mr.
Parker, but I sincerely hope nothing of the sort happens! We had enough
of that on Earthquake Island!

One can not halt the forces of nature, said the scientist, solemnly.
There are many towering peaks around here which may contain old
volcanoes. And I notice the presence of iron ore all about. This must be
a wonderful place in a thunder and lightning storm.

Why? asked Tom, curiously.

Because lightning would be powerfully attracted here by the presence
of the metal. In fact there is evidence that many of the peaks have been
struck by lightning, and the scientist showed curious, livid scars on
the stone faces of the peaks within sight.

Then this is a good place to stay away from in a storm, observed Mr.
Damon. However, we won't worry about that now. If this is the landmark
Mr. Jenks was searching for, then we must be in the vicinity of Phantom
Mountain.

I think we are, declared the diamond seeker. Probably it is within
sight now, but there are so many peaks, and this is such a wild and
desolate part of the country that we may have trouble in locating it.

We've got to make a beginning, anyhow, decided Tom, and the sooner
the better. Come, we'll make up our camping kits, and start out.

It was something to know that they were on the right trail, and it was a
relief to be able to busy oneself, and not be aimlessly searching for a
mysterious landmark. They all felt this, and soon the airship was taken
to a secluded part of the valley, where it was well hidden from sight in
a grove of trees.

Tom and Mr. Damon then served a good meal, and preparations were made
to start on their search among the mountains--a search which they hoped
would lead them to Phantom Mountain, and the cave of the diamond makers.

The tent which would afford them shelter was in sections, and could
be laced together. They carried food, compressed into small packages,
coffee, a few cooking utensils; and each one had a gun, Tom carrying a
combination rifle and shotgun, for game.

We can't live very high while we're on the trail, said the young
inventor, but it won't be much worse than it was on Earthquake Island.
Are we all ready?

I guess so, answered Mr. Damon. How long are we going to be away?

Until we find the diamond makers! declared Tom, firmly.

Shouldering their packs, the adventurers started off. Tom turned for a
last look at his airship, dimly seen amid the trees. Would he ever come
back to the Red Cloud? Would she be there when he did return? Would
their quest be successful? These questions the lad asked himself, as he
followed his companions along the rocky trail.

Perhaps we can find the road by which these men go in and out of the
cave, suggested Mr. Damon, when they had gone on for several miles.

I fancy not, replied Mr. Jenks. They probably take great pains to
hide it. I think though, that our best plan will be to go here and
there, looking for the entrance to the cave. I believe I would remember
the place.

But why can't you follow the directions given by the miner who told you
about Phantom Mountain? asked Mr. Damon.

Because his talk was too indefinite, answered Mr. Jenks. He was so
frightened by seeing what he believed to be a ghost, that he didn't take
much notice of the location of the place. All he knows is that Phantom
Mountain is somewhere around here.

And we've got to hunt until we find it; is that the idea? asked Mr.
Parker.

Or until we see the phantom, added Tom, in a low voice.

Bless my topknot! exclaimed Mr. Damon. You don't mean to say you
expect to see that ghost; do you Tom?

Perhaps, answered the young inventor, and he did not add something
else of which he was thinking. For Tom had a curious theory regarding
the phantom.

They tramped about the remainder of that day. Toward evening Tom shot
some birds, which made a welcome addition to their supper. Then the tent
was put together, some spruce and hemlock boughs were cut to make a soft
bed, and on these, while the light of a campfire gleamed in on them, the
adventurers slept.

Their experience the following day was similar to the first. They saw no
evidence of a large cave such as Mr. Jenks had described, nor were there
any traces of men having gone back and forth among the mountains, as
might have been expected of the diamond makers, for, as Mr. Jenks had
said, they made frequent journeys to the settlement for food, and other
supplies.

Well, I haven't begun to give up yet, announced Tom, on the third day,
when their quest was still unsuccessful. But I think we are making one
mistake.

What is that? inquired Mr. Jenks.

I think we should go up higher. In my opinion the cave is near the top
of some peak; isn't it, Mr. Jenks?

I have that impression, though, as you know, I never saw the outside of
it. Still, it might not be a bad idea to ascend some of these peaks.

Following this suggestion, they laid their trail more toward the sky,
and that night found them encamped several thousand feet above the
sea-level. It was quite cool, and the campfire was a big one about which
they sat after supper, talking of many things.

Tom did not sleep well that night. He tossed from side to side on the
bed of boughs, and once or twice got up to replenish the fire, which had
burned low. His companions were in deep slumber.

I wonder what time it is? mused Tom, when he had been up the third
time to throw wood on the blaze. Must be near morning. He looked at
his watch, and was somewhat startled to see that it was only a little
after twelve. Somehow it seemed much later.

As he was putting the timepiece back into his pocket the lad looked
around at the dark and gloomy mountains, amid which they were encamped.
As his gaze wandered toward the peak of the one on the side of which the
tent was pitched, he gave a start of surprise.

For, coming down a place where, that afternoon, Tom had noticed a sort
of indefinite trail was a figure in white. A tall, waving figure, which
swayed this way and that--a figure which halted and then came on again.

I wonder--I wonder if that can be a wisp of fog? mused the young
inventor. He rubbed his eyes, thinking it might be a swirling of the
night mist or a defect of vision. Then, as he saw more plainly, he
noticed the thing in white rushing toward him.

It's the phantom--the phantom! cried Tom, aloud. It's the thing the
miner saw! We're on Phantom Mountain now!




CHAPTER XIV--WARNED BACK


Tom's cries awakened the sleepers in the tent. Mr. Damon was the first
to rush out.

Bless my nightcap, Tom! he cried. What is it? What has happened? Are
we attacked by a mountain lion?

For answer the young inventor pointed up the mountain, to where, in the
dim light from a crescent moon, there stood boldly revealed, the figure
in white.

Bless--bless my very existence! cried the odd man. What is it, Tom?

The phantom, was the quiet answer. Watch it, and see what it does.

By this time Mr. Jenks and Mr. Parker had joined Tom and Mr. Damon.
The four diamond seekers stood gazing at the apparition. And, as they
looked, the thing in white, seemingly too tall for any human being, slid
slowly forward, with a gliding motion. Then it raised its long, white
arms, and waved them threateningly at the adventurers.

It's motioning us to go back, said Mr. Parker in an awed whisper. It
doesn't want us to go any farther.

Very likely, agreed Tom, coolly. But we're not going to be frightened
by anything like that; are we?

Not much! exclaimed Mr. Jenks. I expected this. A ghost can't drive
me back from getting my rights from those scoundrels!

Suppose it uses a revolver to back up its demand? asked the scientist.

Wait until it does, answered Mr. Jenks. But the figure in white
evidently had no such intentions. It came on a little distance
farther, still waving the long arms threateningly, and then it suddenly
disappeared, seeming to dissolve in the misty shadows of the night.

Bless my suspenders! cried Mr. Damon. That's a very strange
proceeding! Very strange! What do you make of it, Tom?

It is evidently some man dressed up in a sheet, declared Mr. Jenks. I
expected as much.

The work of those diamond makers; do you think? continued Mr. Damon.

I believe so, answered Tom, slowly, for he was trying to think it out.
I believe they are the cause of the phantom, though I don't know that
it's a man dressed in a sheet.

Why isn't it? demanded Mr. Jenks.

Because it was too tall for a man, unless he's a giant.

He may have been on stilts, suggested Mr. Parker.

No man on stilts could walk along that way, declared Tom, confidently.
He glided along too easily. I am inclined to think it may be some sort
of a light.

A light? queried Mr. Damon.

Yes, the diamond makers may be hidden in some small cave near here, and
they may have some sort of a magic lantern or a similar arrangement, for
throwing a shadow picture. They could arrange it to move as they liked,
and could cause it to disappear at will. That, I think, is the ghost we
have just seen.

But the diamond makers have only been in this mountain recently,
 objected Mr. Jenks, and the phantom was here before them. In fact, that
was what gave the place its name.

That may be, admitted the lad. There are many places that have the
name of being haunted, but no one ever sees the ghost. It is always some
one else, who has heard of some one who has seen it. That may have been
the case here. I grant that this place may have been called 'Phantom
Mountain' for a number of years, due to the superstitious tales of
miners. The diamond makers came along, found the conditions just right
for their work, and adopted the ghost, so to speak. As there wasn't any
real spirit they made one, and they use it to scare people away. I think
that's what we've just seen, though I may be wrong in my theory as to
what the phantom is.

Well, it's gone now, at any rate, said Mr. Jenks, and I think we'd
better get back inside the tent. It's cold out here.

Aren't some of us going to stand guard? demanded Mr. Damon.

What for? asked Mr. Jenks.

Why--er--bless my key-ring! Suppose that ghost takes a notion to come
down here, and use his gun, as he did on the miners?

I don't believe that will happen, remarked Tom. The diamond makers,
if the white thing had anything to do with them, have given us a
warning, and I think they'll at least wait until morning to see how we
heed it.

We aren't going to heed it! burst out Mr. Jenks. I'm going to go
right ahead and find that cave where they make diamonds!

And we're with you! exclaimed Tom. We'll have a good fire going the
rest of the night, and that may keep intruders away. In the morning
we'll begin our search, and we'll go up the trail where we saw the white
figure.

A big pile of wood had been collected for the fire, and Tom now piled
some logs and branches on the blaze. It would last for some time now,
and the adventurers, still talking of the ghost went back into the
tent. It was over an hour before they all got to sleep again, and Mr.
Jenks and Mr. Damon took turns in getting up once or twice during the
remainder of the night to replenish the fire.

Morning dawned without anything further having occurred to disturb them,
and, after a hearty breakfast, to which Tom added some fish he caught in
a nearby mountain stream, they set off up the trail on Phantom Mountain.

They had left their tent standing, as they proposed making that spot
their headquarters until they located the cave they were seeking. What
their course would be after that would depend on the circumstances.

If they had expected to have an easy task locating the cavern in which
Mr. Jenks had seen diamonds made, the adventurers were disappointed. All
that day they tramped up and down the mountain, looking for some secret
entrance, but none was disclosed. The higher they went up the great
peak, the fainter became the trail, until, at length it vanished
completely.

But this was not to be wondered at, since it was on solid rock, in which
no footsteps would leave an impression.

They never brought you up here in a wagon, Mr. Jenks, decided Tom,
when he saw how steep the place was.

I'm inclined to think so myself, admitted the diamond man. They must
have reached the cave from some other way. As a matter of fact, I walked
some distance after getting out of the vehicle, before we got to the
cavern. But, even at that, I don't believe we came this way.

Yet the phantom was here, persisted Tom, and I'm convinced that the
cave is in this neighborhood. It's up to us to find it!

But they searched the remainder of that day in vain, and as night was
coming on, they made their way back to the camp. As Tom, who was in
the lead, approached the tent, he saw something black fastened to the
entrance.

Hello! he cried. Some one's been here. That wasn't on the tent when
we left this morning.

What is it? asked Mr. Damon.

A black piece of paper, written on with white ink, replied the lad. He
was reading it, and, as he perused it a look of surprise came over his
face.

Listen to this! called Tom. It's evidently from the diamond makers.

Holding up the black paper, on which the white writing stood out in bold
relief Tom read aloud:


Be warned in time! Go back before it is too late! You are near to
death! Go back!


Bless my shoelaces! cried Mr. Damon. This is getting serious.




CHAPTER XV--THE LANDSLIDE


Gathered about the young inventor, the three men looked at the warning.
The writing was poor, and it was evident that an attempt had been made
to disguise it. But there was no misspelling of words, and there were no
rudely drawn daggers, or bloody hands or anything of that sort. In fact,
it was a very business-like sort of warning.

Rather odd, commented Mr. Jenks. Black paper and white ink.

White ink is easy enough to make, stated Mr. Parker. I fancy they
wanted it as conspicuous as possible.

Yes, agreed Tom, and this warning, together with the antics of the
thing in white last night, shows that they are aware of our presence
here, and perhaps know who we are. We will have to be on our guard.

Do you think that fellow Munson, whom we left in the forest, could have
gotten here and warned them? asked Mr. Damon.

It's possible, admitted Tom, but now let's see if the person who
pinned this warning on our tent took any of our things.

A hasty examination, however, showed that nothing had been disturbed,
and Tom and Mr. Damon were soon getting supper ready, everyone talking,
during the progress of the meal, about the events of the day, and the
rather weird culmination of it.

Well, we haven't had a great deal of success--so far, admitted Tom, as
they sat about the fire, in the fast gathering dusk. I think, perhaps,
we'd better try on the other side of the mountain to-morrow. We've
explored this side pretty thoroughly.

Good idea, commented Mr. Jenks. We'll do it, and move our camp. I
only hope those fellows don't find our airship and destroy it. We'll
have a hard time getting back to civilization again, if we have to walk
all the way.

This contingency caused Tom some uneasiness. He did not like to think
that the unscrupulous men might damage the Red Cloud, that had been
built only after hard labor. But he knew he could accomplish nothing by
worrying, and he tried to dismiss the matter from his mind.

They rather expected to see the thing in white again that night, but it
did not appear, and morning came without anything having disturbed their
heavy sleep, for they were tired from the day's tramp.

It took them the greater part of the day to make a circuit of the base
of Phantom Mountain in order to get to a place where a sort of trail led
upward.

It's too late to do anything to-night, decided Tom, as they set up the
tent. We'll rest, and start the first thing in the morning.

And the ghost isn't likely to find us here, added Mr. Damon. Where
are you going, Mr. Parker? he asked, as he saw the scientist tramping a
little way up the side of the mountain.

I am going to make some observations, was the answer, and no one paid
any more attention to him for some time. Supper was nearly ready when
Mr. Parker returned. His face wore a rather serious air, and Mr. Damon,
noting it, asked laughingly:

Well, did you discover any volcanoes, that may erupt during the night,
and scare us to death?

No, replied Mr. Parker, calmly, but there is every indication that we
will soon have a terrific electrical storm. From a high peak I caught a
glimpse of one working this way across the mountains.

Then we'd better fasten the tent well down, called Tom. We don't want
it to blow away.

There will not be much danger from wind, was Mr. Parker's opinion.

From what then? asked Mr. Jenks.

From the discharges of lightning among these mountain peaks, which
contain so much iron ore. We will be in grave danger.

The fact that the scientist had not always made correct predictions was
not now considered by his hearers, and Tom and the two men gazed at Mr.
Parker in some alarm.

Is there anything we can do to avoid it? asked Mr. Jenks.

The only thing to do would be to leave the mountain, was the answer,
and, as the iron ore extends for miles, we can not get out of the
danger zone before the storm will reach us. It will be here in less than
half an hour.

Then we'd better have supper, remarked Tom, practically, and get
ready for it. Perhaps it may not be as bad as Mr. Parker fears.

It will be bad enough, declared the gloomy scientist, and he seemed to
find pleasure in his announcement.

The meal was soon over, and Tom busied himself in looking to the guy
ropes of the tent, for he feared lest there might be wind with the
storm. That it was coming was evident, for now low mutterings of thunder
could be heard off toward the west.

Black clouds rapidly obscured the heavens, and the sound of thunder
increased. Fitful flashes of lightning could be seen forking across the
sky in jagged chains of purple light.

It's going to be a heavy storm, Tom admitted to himself. I hope
lightning doesn't strike around here.

The storm came on rapidly, but there was a curious quietness in the air
that was more alarming than if a wind had blown. The campfire burned
steadily, and there was a certain oppressiveness in the atmosphere.

It was now quite dark, save when the fitful lightning flashes came,
and they illuminated the scene brilliantly for a few seconds. Then, by
contrast, it was blacker than ever.

Suddenly, as Tom was gazing up toward the peak of Phantom Mountain, he
saw something that caused him to cry out in alarm. He pointed upward,
and whispered hoarsely:

The ghost again! There's our friend in white!

The others looked, and saw the same weird figure that had menaced them
when they were encamped on the other side of the peak.

They must have followed us, said Mr. Jenks, in a low voice.

Slowly the figure advanced, It waved the long white arms, as if in
warning. At times it would be only dimly visible in the blackness, then,
suddenly it would stand out in bold relief as a great flash of fire
split the clouds.

The thunder, meanwhile, had been growing louder and sharper, indicating
the nearer approach of the storm. Each lightning flash was followed in a
second or two, by a terrific clap. Still there was no wind nor rain, and
the campfire burned steadily.

All at once there was a crash as if the very mountain had split asunder,
and the adventurers saw a great ball of purple-bluish fire shoot down,
as if from some cloud, and strike against the side of the crag, not a
hundred feet from where stood the ghostly figure in white.

That was a bad one, cried Mr. Damon, shouting so as to be heard above
the echoes of the thunderclap.

Almost as he spoke there came another explosion, even louder than the
one preceding. A great ball of fire, pear shaped, leaped for the same
spot in the mountain.

There's a mass of iron ore there! yelled Mr. Parker. The lightning is
attracted to it!

His voice was swallowed up in the terrific crash that followed, and,
as there came another flash of the celestial fire, the figure in
white could be seen hurrying back up the mountain trail. Evidently the
electrical storm, with lightning bolts discharging so close, was too
much for the ghost.

In another instant it looked as if the whole place about where the
diamond seekers stood, was a mass of fire. Great forked tongues of
lightning leaped from the clouds, and seemed to lick the ground. There
was a rattle and bang of thunder, like the firing of a battery of guns.
Tom and the others felt themselves tingling all over, as if they had
hold of an electrical battery, and there was a strong smell of sulphur
in the air.

We are in the midst of the storm! cried Mr. Parker. We are standing
on a mass of iron ore! Any minute may be our last!

But fate had not intended the adventurers for death by lightning. Almost
as suddenly as it had begun, the discharge of the tongues of fire ceased
in the immediate vicinity of our friends. They stood still--awed--not
knowing what to do.

Then, once more, came a terrific clap! A great mass of fire, like some
red-hot ingot from a foundry, was hurled through the air, straight at
the face of the mountain, and at the spot where the figure in white had
stood but a few minutes before.

Instantly the earth trembled, as it had at Earthquake Island, but it was
not the same. It was over in a few seconds. Then, as the diamond seekers
looked, they saw in the glare of a score of lightning flashes that
followed the one great clap, the whole side of the mountain slip away,
and go crashing into the valley below.

A landslide! cried Mr. Parker. That is the landslide which I
predicted! The lightning bolt has split Phantom Mountain!




CHAPTER XVI--THE VAST CAVERN


For a time the roiling, slipping, sliding and tumbling of the mass of
earth and stones, down the side of the mountain, effectually drowned
all other sounds. Even the thunder was stilled, and though Tom and his
companions called to one another in terror, their voices could not rise
above that terrific tumult.

Finally, when they found that the direction of the slide was away from
their tent, and that they were not likely to be engulfed, they grew more
calm.

Gradually the noise subsided. The great boulders had rolled to the
bottom of the valley, and now only a mass of earth and stones was
sliding down. Even this stopped in about five minutes, and, as though
satisfied with what it had done, the electrical storm passed. Not a drop
of rain had fallen.

Bless my shirt studs! exclaimed Mr. Damon, who was the first to speak
after the din had quieted. Bless my soul! But that was awful!

It was just what I expected, said Mr. Parker, calmly. I knew, from
my observations, that we were in a region where landslides and terrific
electrical storms may be expected at any time. I fully looked for this.

Well, remarked Mr. Jenks, rather sarcastically, I hope it came up to
your expectations, Mr. Parker.

Oh, fully, was the answer, though I wish it could have happened
in daylight, so that I could better have observed certain phenomena
regarding the landslide. They are very interesting.

At a distance, admitted Tom, with a laugh of relief. Well, I'm glad
it's over, though we'll have to wait until morning to see what damage
has been done. Lucky we weren't struck by lightning. I never saw such
bolts!

Me, either! declared Mr. Damon. This mountain seems to attract them.

It is like a magnet, said Mr. Parker. I think I shall be able to make
some fine observations here.

If we live through it, murmured Mr. Jenks.

They watched the play of lightning about a distant bank of clouds,
but the storm was now far away, only a faint rumbling of thunder being
heard.

I'm wondering what happened to the phantom, said Tom, after a pause.
Seems to me he was right in that track of the storm.

Do you think it was a 'he'? asked Mr. Jenks.

I think we'll find that it's some sort of a man, answered the young
inventor. We may find out very soon, now. I've changed my theory about
the ghost being reflections of light.

How's that? Mr. Damon wanted to know.

Well, I think we are on the side of Phantom Mountain where the diamond
cave is, went on the lad. The fact that the phantom appeared here,
soon after we arrived, shows that the men kept close track of our
movements. It also shows, I think, that the phantom did not have to
travel far to be on the spot, whereas we had to make quite a trip to get
around the base of the mountain. I think the cave is up there, and
Tom pointed toward the spot where the weird figure had been last seen,
before the storm drove it back.

There may be two phantoms, suggested Mr. Jenks. They may keep one on
this side of the mountain, and one on the other, to warn intruders away.

It's possible, admitted Tom. Well, we'll see how things look in the
morning, when we'll take up our march again, and go up the mountain.
We'll reach the top, if possible, which we couldn't do from the other
side, as it was too steep.

I hope we shall be able to go forward in the morning, came from Mr.
Jenks.

What do you mean? asked the lad, struck by a peculiar significance in
the diamond man's tones.

Why, that landslide may have opened a great gully in the side of
Phantom Mountain, which will prevent us from passing. It was a terrific
lot of earth and stones that slid away, answered Mr. Jenks.

It certainly was, agreed Mr. Parker. I would not be surprised if
the mountain was half destroyed, and it may be that the diamond cave no
longer exists.

Not very cheerful, to say the least, murmured Mr. Jenks to Tom, and,
as it was getting quite chilly, following the storm, they went inside
the tent.

Tom could hardly wait for daylight, to get up and see what havoc the
landslide had wrought. As soon as the first faint flush of dawn showed
over the eastern peaks, he hurried from the tent. Mr. Damon heard him
arise, and followed.

A curious scene met their eyes. All about were great rocks rent and torn
by the awful power of the lightning. The fronts of the stone cliffs
were scarred and burned by the electrical fire, and fantastic markings,
grotesque faces, and leering animals seemed to have been drawn by some
gigantic artist who used a bolt from heaven for his brush.

But the eyes of Tom and Mr. Damon took all this in at a glance, and then
their gaze went forward to where the avalanche had torn away a great
part of the mountain.

Whew! I should say it was a landslide! cried Tom.

Bless my wishbone, yes! agreed Mr. Damon.

Below them, in the valley, lay piled immense masses of earth and stones.
Boulders were heaped up on boulders, and rocks upon rocks, being tossed
about in heaps, strung about in long ridges, and swirled about in
curves, as though some cyclone had toyed with them after the lightning
flash had tossed them there.

But the mountain isn't half gone, said Tom, as his eyes took in what
was left of the phantom berg. I guess it will take a few more bolts
like that one, to put this hill out of business.

Though the landslide had been a great one, the larger part of the
mountain still stood. An immense slice had been taken from one side, but
the summit was untouched.

And there's where the diamond cave is! cried Tom, pointing to it.

I think so myself, agreed Mr. Jenks, who came from the tent at that
moment, and joined the lad and Mr. Damon. I think we shall find the
cave somewhere up there. We must start for it, as soon as we have eaten,
and we may reach it by night.

The three stood gazing up toward the summit of the great mountain.
Suddenly, as the sun rose higher in the heavens, it sent a shaft of rosy
light on the face of the berg that had been scarred by the landslide.
Tom Swift uttered an exclamation, and pointed at something.

See! he cried. Look where the trail is--the trail down which the
phantom must have come. It is on the edge of a cliff now!

They looked, and saw that this was so. The increasing light had just
revealed it to them. When the lightning bolt had torn away a great
portion of the mountain it had cut sheer down for a great depth and
when the earth and stones fell away they left a narrow pathway, winding
around the mountain, but so near the edge of a great chasm, that there
was room but for one person at a time to walk on that footway. The
uncertain trail up Phantom Mountain had all but been destroyed.

The way up to the peak is by that path, now, spoke Tom, in a low
voice.

Bless my soul! cried Mr. Damon. It's as much as a man's life is worth
to attempt it. If he got dizzy, he'd topple over, and fall a thousand
feet. Dare we risk it?

It's the only way to get up, went on Tom. It's either that way, or
not at all. We've tried the other side without success. We must go up
this way--or turn back.

Then we'll go up! cried Mr. Jenks. It may not be as dangerous as it
looks from here.

But it was even more dangerous than it appeared, when they went part way
up it after a hasty breakfast. The trail was a mere ledge of rock now,
and in some places, to get around a projecting edge of the mountain,
they had to stand with their backs to the dizzy depths at their feet,
and with both arms outstretched work their way around to where the trail
was wider.

Shall we risk it? asked Tom, when they had tried the way, and found
it so dangerous. We can't take anything with us--even our guns, for
we couldn't carry them, and if we reach the mouth of the cave, and find
those men there--

He paused significantly. The adventurers looked at one another. The
search for the diamond makers was becoming more and more dangerous.

I say let's go on! decided Mr. Damon, suddenly. We want to locate
that cave, first of all. Perhaps, when we do find it, we may see some
easier way of getting to it than this. And if those diamond makers do
attack us--well, I don't believe they'll shoot defenseless men, and they
may listen to reason, and give Mr. Jenks his rights--tell him how to
make diamonds in return for the money he gave them.

I don't believe those scoundrels will listen to reason, replied the
diamond man, but I agree with Mr. Damon that we ought to go on. We may
find some other means of reaching the cave--if we can discover it, and
we'll take a chance with the men.

Forward it is, then! cried Tom. I have a revolver, and I can supply
one of you gentlemen with another. They may come in useful in an
emergency. Let's go back to camp, take a little lunch in our pockets,
and try to scale the mountain.

They were soon on their way up the dizzy path once more, and, as they
advanced, they found it growing more and more dangerous. In some places
they found it almost impossible to get around certain corners, where
there was barely room for their feet. As Tom remarked grimly, a fat man
never could have done it. Fortunately they were all comparatively thin,
for their hard work, and not too abundant food, since they had left the
airship, had reduced their weight.

Up and up they went, higher and higher, sometimes finding the path wide
enough for two to walk abreast, and again seeing it narrow almost to
a ribbon. They hardly dared look down into the chasm at their left--a
chasm filled, in part, with the rocks and boulders tossed into it by the
lightning bolt.

Tom was in the lead, and had just made a dangerous turn around a
shoulder of rock--one of those places where he had to extend both arms,
and fairly hug the cliff before he could get around.

But, when he had made it, and found himself on a broad pathway, cut
in the living rock, he gave a great shout--a shout that caused his
companions to hasten to his side. They found the young inventor pointing
to a clump of bushes and small trees.

But it was not the shrubbery that Tom desired to call to their
attention. They saw that in an instant, for, dimly seen through the
leaves, was something black, and, as they looked more closely, they saw
that it was a great hole in the side of the mountain--a vast cavern,
opening like a tunnel.

The cave! The cave! cried Tom. The diamond makers' cave!

Hardly had he spoken than two men, each one carrying a gun, showed
themselves in the mouth of the cavern, and, instant later they both ran
toward the little party of adventurers.




CHAPTER XVII--THE PHANTOM CAPTURED


Surprise held Tom and his friends almost spellbound for the moment.
The young inventor's hand went toward the pocket where he carried his
revolver. Mr. Jenks, who had the only other weapon, sought to draw it,
but he was stopped by a gesture of one of the two men with guns.

Hold on, strangers! the man cried. I know what you're up to! Better
not try to draw anything--it might not be healthy. Now, then, who are
you, and what do you want?

The question came rather as a surprise, at least to Tom and Mr. Jenks.
They had taken it for granted that these men--if they were the diamond
makers--would know Mr. Jenks, and guess at his errand in coming back
to Phantom Mountain. But, it seemed, that they took them all for casual
strangers.

No one answered for a moment. Tom caught the eye of Mr. Jenks, and there
was a look of hope in it. If ever there was a time for strategy, it was
now. Evidently Munson, the stowaway on the airship, had not yet been
able to send a warning to his confederates. And neither of the two men
recognized Mr. Jenks as the man who had been defrauded of his rights.
It might be possible to conceal the real object of the adventurers until
they had time to formulate a plan of action.

Well, exclaimed the man with the gun, impatiently, I ask you folks a
question. What do you want?

Fortunately, neither Mr. Damon nor Mr. Parker replied. The former
because he deferred to Tom and Mr. Jenks, and the scientist because he
was busy inspecting some curious rocks he picked up. As it turned out
this was the luckiest thing he could have done. It lent color to what
Mr. Jenks said a moment later.

What are you doing up here? demanded the man again. Don't you know
this is private property?

We--we were just looking around, answered Mr. Jenks, which was true
enough; as far as it went.

Prospecting, added Tom.

After gold? demanded the second man, suspiciously.

We'd be glad to find some, retorted the lad. At that moment Mr. Parker
began breaking off bits of rock with a small geologist's hammer which he
carried. The men with the guns looked at him.

So you think you'll find gold up here? asked the one who had first
spoken.

Is there any? inquired Tom, trying to make his voice sound eager.

Nary a bit, strangers, was the answer, and the two men laughed
heartily. Now, we don't want to seem harsh, went on the man who seemed
to be the spokesman, but you'd better get away from here. This is
private ground, and dangerous too--how'd you ever get up the trail--we
heard it was destroyed.

There is still a narrow path, said Mr. Jenks. We came up that--the
lightning and landslide haven't left much of it, though.

Mr. Parker looked quickly up from the rocks at which he was tapping with
his small hammer. You have terrific lightning up here, he said. I am
much interested in it, from a scientific standpoint. I predict that some
day the entire mountain will be destroyed by a blast from the sky.

I hope it won't be right away, spoke one of the men. Now I guess you
folks had better be leaving while there's a path left to go down by.

Might I ask, broke in Mr. Parker, as calmly as though he was lecturing
to a class of students, might I ask if you have noticed any peculiar
effect of the lightning up here on the summit of the mountain? Does it
fuse and melt rocks, so to speak?

What's that? cried the spokesman, with a sudden flash of anger. The
two men looked at each other.

I wanted to know, merely for scientific reasons, whether the lightning
up here ever melted rocks? repeated Mr. Jenks.

Well, whether it's for scientific reasons or for any other, I'm not
going to answer you! snapped the man. It's none of your affair what
the lightning does up here. Now you'd all better 'vamoose'--clear out!

All right--we'll go, said Tom, quickly, at the same time motioning to
Mr. Jenks to agree with him. The eyes of the young inventor were
roving about. He saw what looked like a second trail, leading down the
mountain, from the far side of the cave. He was convinced now that there
was another way to get to it. Possibly they might find it. At any rate
nothing more could be done now. They must go back, for the cavern was
too well guarded to attempt to enter it by force--at least just yet.

Yes, we'll go back, assented Mr. Jenks.

Mr. Parker was tapping away at the rocks. He looked toward the black
mouth of the big cave. On what corresponded to the roof of it, some
distance back from the entrance, he saw a slender metal rod sticking up
into the air.

May I ask if that's a lightning rod? he inquired innocently. If
it is, I should like to ask about its action in a mountain that is so
impregnated with iron ore.

You may ask until you get tired! cried the spokesman, again showing
unreasoning anger, but you'll get no answer from us. Now get away from
here before we do something desperate. You're on private ground and
you're not wanted. Clear out while you have the chance.

There was no help for it. Slowly our friends turned and began to go
down the dangerous trail. They were soon out of sight of the two men who
stood before the cave, with their guns ready, but neither Tom nor any of
his companions spoke for some time.

When they had rounded one of the most dangerous turns the young inventor
sat down to rest, an example followed by the others.

Well, asked Tom, do you think those are some of the diamond makers,
Mr. Jenks?

I certainly do, though I never saw those two men before. If I could
once get inside the cave, I could tell whether or not it was the one
where I was practically held a prisoner. But I'm sure it is. I know some
of the men used to go off every day with guns, and not come back until
night. I have no doubt they were on guard, just as these two are. And,
also, I think I heard them speak of a second entrance to the cavern. The
one we just saw may not be the main one, through which I was taken.

I believe we are on the right track, ventured Mr. Damon, but we will
either have to go up there after dark, which will be risky, on account
of the narrow trail, or else we will have to find some other path.

The last would be better, spoke Tom.

That rod of metal sticking up on top of the cave interested me, said
the scientist. Did you hear anything of that when you were here before,
Mr. Jenks?

No. Probably that is only a lightning rod, or it may be a staff for a
signal flag. But what surprises me is that those men didn't suspect
that we were seeking to discover their secret. They took us for ordinary
prospectors.

So much the better, remarked Tom. We have a chance now of getting
inside that cave. But we will have to go back to camp, and make other
plans. And we must hurry, or it will be dark before we get there.

They hastened their steps, pausing only briefly to eat some of the lunch
they had brought along, and to drink from a spring that bubbled from the
side of the mountain. It was getting dusk when they got back to their
tent. They found nothing disturbed.

I wonder if we'll see that phantom again to-night? ventured Tom, as
they were sitting about the campfire a little later.

Probably not, remarked Mr. Jenks. I don't believe the ghost will
venture down the dangerous trail after dark, and the gang may think
that the warning given us by the two men on guard at the cave will be
sufficient. But if we don't leave here by to-morrow I think we will have
another visit from the thing in white.

It was about an hour after this when Tom was collecting some wood in a
pile nearer the fire, so as to have it ready to throw on, in case there
was any alarm in the night, that he happened to look up toward the
summit of the mountain. A slight noise, as of loose stones rolling down,
attracted his attention, and, at first, he feared lest another landslide
was beginning, but a moment later he saw what caused it.

There, advancing down the steep and dangerous trail was the figure
in white--the phantom. Instantly a daring plan came into Tom's head.
Dropping the wood softly, he moved back out of the glare of the fire.

Mr. Jenks! he called in a whisper.

The diamond man, who was behind the tent, came toward Tom.

What is it? he asked. Then, as he saw the ghostly visitor, he added:
Oh--the phantom again! What's it up to?

The same thing, replied Tom, but it won't do it long, if my plan
succeeds.

What plan is that, Tom?

I'm going to try to capture that--that man--or whatever it is. Will you
help?

Surely!

Then let's work around behind it, while Mr. Damon and Mr. Parker come
up from in front. We'll solve this part of the mystery, anyhow, if it's
possible!

The two other men were soon told of the plan. Meanwhile the thing in
white had advanced slowly, until within a few hundred feet of the camp.
They could see now that it was no shaft of light, but some white body,
shaped like a tall, thin man, draped in a white garment. The long arms
waved to and fro. There was no semblance of a head.

You and Mr. Parker go right toward it, slowly, Mr. Damon, advised
Tom. Mr. Jenks and I will make a circle, and get in back. Then, if it's
anything alive we'll have it.

The ghost continued to advance. Tom and the diamond man stole off to
one side, their buckskin moccasins making no sound. Mr. Damon and the
scientist went boldly forward.

This movement appeared to disconcert the spirit. It halted, waved the
arms with greater vigor than before, and seemed to indicate to the
adventurers that it was dangerous to advance. But Mr. Damon and Mr.
Parker kept on. They wanted to give Tom and Mr. Jenks time enough to
make the circuit.

Suddenly the stillness of the night was broken by a low whistle. It was
Tom's signal that he and Mr. Jenks were ready.

Come on! Run! cried Mr. Damon.

The scientist and the eccentric man leaped forward.

The ghost heard the whistle, and heard the spoken words. The thing in
white hesitated a moment, and then raised one arm. There was a flash of
fire, and a loud report.

He's firing in the air! cried Tom. Come on, we have him now!

Undaunted by the display of firearms, Mr. Damon and Mr. Parker kept on.
They could hear Tom and Mr. Jenks running up in back of the figure.
The latter also heard this, and suddenly turned. Caught between the two
forces of our friends, the ghost was at a loss what to do.

The next instant Tom, who had distanced Mr. Jenks, made a flying tackle
for the figure in white, and caught it around the legs. Very substantial
legs they were, too, Tom felt--the legs of a man.

Wow! yelled the ghost, as he went down in a heap, the revolver
falling from his hand.

Come on! cried Tom. I have him!

His friends rushed to his aid. There was a confused mass of dark bodies,
arms and legs mingled with something tall and thin, all in white.
Suddenly the moon came from behind a cloud and they could see what they
had captured--for captured the phantom was.

It proved to be a rather small man, who wore upon his shoulders a
framework of wood, over which some white cloth was draped. It had fallen
off him when Tom made that tackle.

Well, remarked the young inventor, as he sat on the struggling man's
chest. I guess we've got you.

I rather guess you have, stranger, was the cool reply.




CHAPTER XVIII--BILL RENSHAW WILL HELP


They were all panting from the exertion of the run up the mountain and
the contest with the phantom--a phantom no longer--though, truth to
tell, the struggle was not nearly so fierce as Tom had expected. He
thought the ghost would put up a stiff fight.

Got any ropes to tie him with? asked Mr. Damon, who was helping Tom
hold the man down.

Ropes? You aren't going to tie me up are you, strangers? asked the
captive.

That's what we are! exclaimed Mr. Jenks. We've had trouble enough in
this matter, and if I've got one of the gang, perhaps I can get some of
the others, and have my rights. So tie him up, Tom, and we'll take him
to camp.

Oh, you needn't go to all that trouble, strangers, went on the man,
calmly. If one of you will get off my chest, and the other gentleman
ease up on my stomach a bit, I'll walk wherever you want me, and not
make any trouble. I haven't got a gun.

Bless my gloves! But you're a cool one, commented Mr. Damon, as he
complied with the man's request, and got up from his stomach. But look
out for him, Tom. He had a gun, for he fired it in the air.

He hasn't it now, answered the young inventor. I knocked it from his
hand when I leaped for him.

That's what you did, assented the man, as he got up, while Tom kept a
tight hold of him, as did Mr. Jenks. What kind of a grizzly bear hug do
you call that, anyhow, that you gave me?

That was a football tackle, explained Tom.

I allers heard that was a dangerous game! remarked the former phantom
simply. Well, now you've got me, what are you going to do with me?

Take you where we can have a good look at you, replied Mr. Jenks, as
he kicked aside the wooden framework, and the sheet which had made the
ghost appear so tall. So this is how you worked it; eh?

Yep. That was the 'haunt' stranger. I made it myself, and it worked all
right until you folks come along. I rather suspicioned from the first,
when I played the trick over on 'tother side of the mountain, that you
wouldn't be so easy to fool as most prospectors are.

Oh, so you're the only ghost then? asked Tom.

I'm the only one.

By this time they had reached the camp. Tom threw some light logs on the
fire, which blazed up brightly. As the flames illuminated the face of
their captive, Mr. Jenks looked at him, and cried out:

Why it's Bill Renshaw!

That's me, admitted the man who had played the part of the phantom,
and thunder-turtles! if it ain't Mr. Jenks who was once in the diamond
cave with us. Whatever happened to you? I never heard. The others said
you got tired and went away.

They took me away--defrauded me of my rights! declared Mr. Jenks,
bitterly. But I'll get them back! To think of Bill Renshaw playing the
part of a ghost!

They made me do it, went on the man, somewhat dejectedly. I wanted to
be at work in the cave, but they wouldn't let me.

Is this man one of the diamond makers? asked Tom, in great surprise.

He is--one of the helpers, though I don't believe he knows the secret
of making the gems, explained Mr. Jenks. He was one of the men in the
cave when I was there before, and he and I struck up quite a friendship;
didn't we, Renshaw?

That's what, and there ain't no reason why we can't be friends now;
that is unless you hold a grudge against me for firing at you. But I
only shot in the air, to scare you away. Them's my instructions. I'm
supposed to be on guard, and scare away strangers. I'm tired of the
work, too, for I don't get my share, and those other fellows, in the
cave, get all the money from the diamonds.

Tom Swift uttered an exclamation. A sudden plan had come to him. Quickly
he whispered to Mr. Jenks:

Make a friend of this man if possible. He evidently is dissatisfied.
Offer him a sum to show us another way into the cave, and we may yet
discover the secret of the diamond makers.

I will, declared Mr. Jenks, quietly. Then, turning to Renshaw, he
added:

Bill, come over here. I want to have a talk with you. Perhaps it will
be to our mutual advantage.

He led the former phantom to one side, and for some time conversed
earnestly with him. Mr. Jenks told the story of how he had been deceived
by Folwell and the others who were at the head of the gang of diamond
makers. The rich man related how they had taken his money, and, after
promising to disclose the secret process to him, had broken faith, and
had drugged him, afterward taking him out of the cave.

I want only my rights, and that for which I paid, concluded Mr. Jenks.
Now, I gather that these men haven't treated you altogether fairly,
Bill.

Indeed they haven't. I helped 'em to the best of my ability, and all
I get out of it is to stay out on this lonely side of the mountain,
and play ghost. They owe me money, too, and they won't pay me, either,
though they have lots, for they sold some diamonds lately.

Then they are still making diamonds? asked Mr. Jenks, eagerly. Have
you seen them? Do you know the secret?

No, I don't know it, for they won't let me in on it. I'm always sent
out of the cave just before they make the gems. But I know they've made
some lately, and have sold 'em. I want my share.

Look here! exclaimed Mr. Jenks, quickly, wishing to strike while the
iron was hot. I'll make you a proposition. Show us how to get into that
cave, unknown to the diamond makers, and I'll pay you twice what they
agreed to. Is it a bargain?

Bill Renshaw considered a moment. Then he thrust out his hand, clasped
that of Mr. Jenks, and exclaimed:

It is. I'll take you into the cave by an entrance that's seldom used.
There are four ways to get in. The one where the two men drove you back
is the rear one. The front one is on the other side of the mountain, but
it's so well concealed that you'd never find it. But I can take you to
one where you can get in, and those fellows will never know it. And,
what's more, I'll help you if it comes to a fight!

Good! exclaimed Mr. Jenks. I think we'll discover the secret of the
diamond makers this time, and he went to tell the others of the success
of his talk. Bill Renshaw had been converted from an enemy into a
friend, and the former phantom was now ready to lead Tom and the others
into the secret cave.

We'll start in the morning, decided Mr. Jenks, who, after many
disappointments, at last saw success ahead of him.




CHAPTER XIX--IN THE SECRET CAVE


Tom Swift was up at break of day, and the others were not far behind
him.

Now for the secret cave! cried the young inventor as he gazed up
the mountain, in the interior of which the mysterious band of men were
making the diamonds.

Have you made any plans, Bill? asked Mr. Jenks of the former phantom,
who had cast his lot in with the adventurers. What will be the best
course for us to follow?

You just leave it to me, Mr. Jenks, was the answer. I'll get you into
the cave, and those fellows, who, I believe, are trying to do me out of
my rights, as they did you out of yours, will never know a thing about
it.

Bless my finger-nails! cried Mr. Damon. That will be great! We can
get in the cave, and watch them make the diamonds at our leisure.

They don't make them every day, explained Renshaw. It seems they
have to wait for certain occasions. Mostly they make the diamonds when
there's a big storm.

A big storm, asked the scientist with a sudden show of interest.
Do you mean one of those electrical storms, such as we had the other
night?

That's it, Mr. Parker, though why they wait until there's a storm is
more than I can tell.

Perhaps they know that on such occasions no one will venture up the
mountain, spoke Mr. Damon.

No, it isn't that, declared the scientist. I think I am on the
track of a great scientific discovery, and I will soon be able to make
observations that will confirm it.

Well, I'm going to make an observation right now, said Tom, with a
laugh. I'm going to see what there is for breakfast.

And that reminds me, came from Mr. Jenks, shall we move our camp,
Bill, and take the tent with us to the cave?

I hardly think so, was the answer. I think the best plan would be to
conceal the tent somewhere around here, in case you might need it again.
You can also store what food you have left.

But, bless my appetite, we don't want to starve in that diamond cave!
 objected Mr. Damon.

I'll see that you don't, declared Bill Renshaw. I'll take you in
there, unbeknownst to those fellows, and I'll provide you with plenty
of food and water. You see the cave is so big that there are some parts
they never visit.

And we can stay in one of those parts, and eat? asked Tom.

Sure, answered Bill.

And watch the diamond makers at work? asked Mr. Jenks.

That's it, replied the former phantom.

Then the sooner we get started the better, remarked Mr. Damon. Mr.
Parker said nothing. He appeared to be thinking deeply, and was tapping
at some rocks with his little hammer.

The advice of Bill Renshaw was followed, and the tent, and what food
remained, was concealed in the bushes, with rocks piled over to keep
away prowling animals. Then they started for the secret cave.

The man who played the part of a ghost picked up the framework and white
cloth that had formed his disguise.

I'll still have to use this, he explained, for I don't want those
fellows to know that I'm helping you. I'll continue to play the spirit
of the mountain, but there won't be much need of it. I don't think any
more people will come prospecting out here.

Have you heard of the arrival of Farley Munson? asked Tom, as he
related the facts about the stowaway.

He hadn't arrived up to a day or so ago, answered Bill. I guess he's
still traveling. Farley is one of the heads of the gang, he added, and
a dangerous man.

As Bill led the way toward the cave, taking a route that the adventurers
had never suspected led to it, he explained that the cavern was a large
one, capable of holding an army.

But there's only a small part of it used by the diamond makers, he
added. They work in a small recess, near the summit of the mountain.
The little cave, where I'm going to take you, opens off from it by a
long passage. And, except that you'll be pretty much in the dark, you'll
be quite comfortable. There are tables, chairs, and some bunks in the
place. I can get you some lights, and plenty of food.

But, if you are seen taking away food, won't the others suspect
something? asked Tom.

I do pretty much as I please, said Bill. I go and come when I like.
All I'm supposed to do is to watch my two sides of the mountain, play
the ghost, and give warning when any one is coming. Sometimes I leave
black and white messages, like the one I put on your tent. Those fellows
fix 'em up for me. I've told 'em about you, though I didn't know who you
were, and they think you have gone, for the two men on guard at the rear
entrance so reported. Sometimes I stay out on the mountain for a couple
of days at a time, when the weather's good, and don't go back to the
cave. Those times I take food with me, and so if they see me making off
with some supplies they'll think I'm going to camp out.

It doesn't look as though we'd ever get into a cave near the top of the
mountain, going this way, said Tom, as they marched along. We're going
down, instead of up.

That's the secret of this trail, explained Bill. We go down in a
sort of valley, and then go up a pretty stiff place, and then we're on
a direct trail to the entrance I told you about. It's a steep road to
climb, but I guess we can manage it.

And a hard climb the adventurers did find it. The road was almost as bad
as the one along the edge of the chasm, but they managed to negotiate
it, and finally found themselves on a fairly good trail.

We'll soon be there, Bill assured them. After you get in the little
cave, where I'm going to hide you, I'll have to leave you for a spell,
until I get my ghost rigging fixed up again. But I'll see that you have
plenty of food and drink.

A little later their guide came to a sudden halt, and peered around
anxiously.

What's the matter? asked Tom.

I was just looking to see if any of the men were about, he answered.
But I guess not--it looks all right. The entrance is right here.

They were on a side of the mountain, near the summit. Below stretched a
magnificent scene. A great valley lay at their feet, and they could look
off to many distant peaks. The main trail to Leadville, and the one to
the settlement of Indian Ridge, was in sight.

Suddenly Tom, who had been using a small but powerful telescope, uttered
an exclamation, and focussed the instrument on a speck that seemed
moving along on the trail below.

A man--coming up the mountain, cried Tom. And--it can't be--yet it
is--it's Farley Munson--the stowaway! he cried. He's coming here!

Let me look! begged Mr. Jenks, taking the glass from Tom. An instant
later the diamond man exclaimed: Yes, it's Munson!

Then in here with you--quick! cried Renshaw. He can't see us yet, and
we'll be out of sight in another minute.

The former spirit pulled aside some thick bushes, and pointed to a hole
which was disclosed.

The entrance to the secret cave, he announced. Slip in all of you.

Tom, after another glance at the man toiling his way up the mountain,
entered the cavern. He was followed by the others. Bill was the last to
enter, and he replaced the bushes over the entrance.

At last! exclaimed Mr. Jenks, as he gazed up at the roof of the
dimly-lighted vault in which they found themselves.

Yes, we're in the diamond makers' secret cave, added Tom. Now to
catch them at work!

Come on, advised Bill, in a low tone, We're not safe yet, and he
produced a lantern from some hidden recess, lighted the wick, and led
the way. As the others followed they were aware of a subdued noise in
the great cavern.




CHAPTER XX--MAKING THE DIAMONDS


What's that noise? asked Tom, as their guide flashed the lantern to
show them the way.

That's the men getting ready to make diamonds, I guess, was the
answer. You see it takes quite a while to get the stuff ready. I don't
know what they use--they never tell me any of their secrets.

Oh, I know the ingredients well enough, said Mr. Jenks, but I
don't know the secret of how they apply the terrific heat and pressure
necessary to fuse the materials into diamonds.

Well, you'll soon know, declared Bill Renshaw. Of course it isn't
always successful. I've known 'em to try half a dozen times before they
got any diamonds big enough to satisfy 'em. They gave me some of the
small ones when I asked for my wages.

How did you come to get in with these men? asked Tom, curious to
understand how a person seemingly as honest as Renshaw appeared to be
had cast his lot in with the men who had broken faith with Mr. Jenks.

Oh, I've lived around these parts all my life, was the answer. I knew
of this cave before these diamond fellers came to it. In fact, I
showed it to 'em. It was several years ago that a party of men who were
prospecting around here came to me and asked if I knew of a small cave
near the top of a high mountain, where lightning storms were frequent.
I told them about Phantom Mountain, as it was called then, and also of
this cave. If there's any place where they have worse lightning storms
than here, I'd like to know it. They scare me, sometimes, like the night
when that landslide happened, and I'm sort of used to 'em.

Well, I took these men to the cave, and they hired me as a sort of
lookout. Then they began their work, and at first I didn't know what
they were up to, but finally I caught on. Then Mr. Jenks came, and
disappeared mysteriously, though then I didn't know that they had played
a trick on him. I was outside most of the time, pretending I was the
ghost. So that's how I came to get in with 'em, and I wish I was out.

You soon will be, I think, declared Mr. Jenks. But won't our talking
be heard by the men?

No danger. There is a thick wall between this part of the cave, and the
part where they live and work. I'll soon have you well hid, and then you
wait until I come back.

What about Munson? asked Tom. He is evidently on his way here to tell
his confederates about us.

He won't know what has happened to us, said Mr. Jenks, and he won't
see anything of us. I guess we're safe enough.

Through the dark passage they followed Bill Renshaw until he came to a
halt in a place that suddenly widened and broadened into a good-sized
cave.

Here's your stopping place, said the former ghost. Now if you follow
that passage, off to the left, and he pointed to it, you'll come
to the larger part of the cave where the diamond makers are. But go
cautiously, and don't make any noise. I won't be responsible for what
happens.

We'll take all the risk, interrupted Tom.

All right. Now there's a couple of lanterns around here. I'll light
them, and leave you for a while until I can get some grub. I'll be back
as soon as I can.

He glided away, after lighting two lanterns, by the gleams of which
the adventurers could see that they were in a vaulted cavern that had
evidently been fitted up as a living apartment. The sides, roof and
floor were of stone. It was clean, and the air was fresh. There were
some chairs, a table, and several cots, with pieces of bagging for
bedding, though it was warm in the place.

I guess we can stay here until we discover the secret, spoke Tom.

Bless my watch! We can if we have something to eat, came from Mr.
Damon, with something like a sigh. I'm hungry!

And I want to make some observations, said Mr. Parker. From what I
have seen of this mountain, I would not be surprised if this cave was
to be suddenly destroyed by a landslide or a lightning bolt. I will make
some further investigations.

Well, if it's going to cause you to make such gloomy prophecies as
that, I'd just as soon you wouldn't look any further, spoke Tom, in
a low voice. But Mr. Parker, taking one of the lanterns, set about
examining the rock of which the cave consisted.

In a short time Bill Renshaw returned with enough food to last for two
days. He said he was going out on the mountain once more to act the part
of a lookout, and would visit the adventurers again the next day.

In the meanwhile you can do just as you please, he said. Nobody is
likely to disturb you here, and you can sneak up and take a look at the
men in the other cave whenever you're ready. Only be careful--that's all
I've got to say. They're desperate men.

It was not very pleasant, eating in the gloomy cavern, but they made the
best of it. They cooked on a small oil-stove they found in the place,
and after some hot coffee they felt much better.

Well, remarked Tom, after a while, shall we take a chance, and go
look at the men at work?

I think so, answered Mr. Jenks. The sooner we discover this mystery,
the better. Then we can go back home.

And recover my airship, added Tom, who was a bit uneasy regarding the
safety of the Red Cloud.

Then, bless my finger-rings! let's go and see if we can find the big
cave your friend the ghost told us of, suggested Mr. Damon.

Cautiously they made their way along the passage Bill had pointed out.
As they went forward the subdued noise became louder, and finally they
could feel the vibration of machinery.

This is the place, whispered Mr. Jenks. That sound we hear is one of
the mixing machines, for grinding the materials--carbon and the other
substances--which go to make up the diamonds. I remember hearing that
when I was in the cave before.

Then we must be near the place, observed Tom.

Yes, but I didn't have much chance to look around when I was here
before. They wouldn't let me. I never even knew of the small cave Bill
took us to.

Well, if we're close to it, we'd better go cautiously, and not talk any
more than we're obliged to, suggested Mr. Parker, and they agreed that
this was good advice.

They walked on softly. Suddenly Tom, who was in the lead, saw a gleam of
light.

We're here, he whispered. I'll put out our lantern, now, which he
did. Then, stealing forward he and the others beheld a curious sight.
The tunnel they were in ended at a small hole which opened into a large
cavern, and, fortunately, this opening was concealed from the view of
those in the main place.

The diamond makers! whispered Tom, hoarsely, pointing to several men
grouped about a number of strange machines.

Yes--the very place where I was, answered Mr. Jenks, and there is the
apparatus--the steel box--from which the diamonds are taken--now to see
how they make them.

Fascinated, the adventurers looked into the cave. The men there were
unaware of the presence of our friends, and were busily engaged. Some
attended to the grinding machine, the roar and clatter of which made
it possible for Tom and the others to talk and move about without being
overheard. Into this machine certain ingredients were put, and they were
then pulverized, and taken out in powdery form.

The power to run the mixing machine was a gasoline motor, which
chug-chugged away in one corner of the cave.

As the powder was taken out, other men fashioned it into small balls,
which were put on pan, and into a sort of oven, that was heated by a
gasoline stove.

Is that how they make the diamonds? asked Mr. Damon.

That is evidently the first step, said Mr. Jenks. Those balls of
powdered chemicals are partly baked, and then they are put into the
steel box. In some way terrific heat and pressure are applied, and the
diamonds are made. But how the heat and pressure are obtained is what we
have yet to learn.

He paused to watch the men at work. They were all busy, some attending
to the machines, and others coming and going in and out of the cave. In
one part a man was apparently getting ready a meal.

Suddenly there rushed into the cave a man who seemed much excited.

Are you nearly ready with that stuff? he cried. There's a good storm
gathering on the mountain!

Yes, we'll be ready in half an hour, answered one of the men at the
mixing machine.

Good. It will be flashing lightning bolts then, and we can see what
luck we have. The last batch was a failure. The man hurried out again.
Mr. Parker touched Tom and Mr. Jenks on their shoulders.

What is it? asked Tom.

I know the secret of making the diamonds, said the scientist.

What? cried Mr. Jenks.

It is by the awful power of the lightning bolts! whispered Mr. Parker.
Everything is explained now--the reason why they make diamonds in this
lonely place, near the top of the mountain. They need a place where the
lightning is powerful. I can understand it now--I suspected it before.
They make diamonds by lightning!

Are you sure? cried Mr. Jenks.

Positive.

I agree with you, said Tom Swift. I was just getting on that track
myself, when I saw the electric wires running to the steel box. That
explains the upright rod on the top of the mountain. The man says
a storm is coming--very well; we'll stay here and watch them make
diamonds!

As he spoke there came the mutter of thunder, and the mountain vibrated
slightly. The men in the cave redoubled their activity. Tom and his
friends felt that the secret process they had so long sought was about
to be demonstrated before their eyes.



CHAPTER XXI--FLASHING GEMS


Eagerly the adventurers looked through the opening at the end of the
passage into the larger cave. The men opened the small oven in which the
balls of white chemicals and carbon mixed, had been baked, and a pile of
things, that looked like irregularly-shaped marbles, were placed in the
steel box.

This box, which was about the size of a trunk, was of massive metal. It
was placed in a recess in the solid rock, and all about were layers of
asbestos and other substances that were nonconductors of heat.

That box becomes red hot, exclaimed Mr. Jenks, in a whisper. When
things are in readiness, that lever is pulled and the diamonds are
made. I pulled it once, but I did not then know the process involved. I
supposed that the lightning had nothing to do with making the diamonds.

It has--a most important part, said Mr. Parker. The hidden adventurers
could talk in perfect safety now, for the men in the large cave were too
excited to pay much attention to them. The muttering of the thunder
grew louder, and at times a particularly loud crash told that a bolt had
struck somewhere in the vicinity of the cave.

But, bless my watch-charm! exclaimed Mr. Damon, I didn't know
lightning made diamonds.

It does not--always, went on the scientist. But great heat and
pressure are necessary to create the gems. In nature this was probably
obtained by prehistoric volcanic fires, and by the terrific pressure of
immense rocks. It is possible to make diamonds in the laboratory of the
chemist, but they are so minute as to be practically valueless.

However, these men seem to have hit upon a new plan. They utilize the
terrific heat of lightning, and the pressure which is instantaneously
obtained when the bolt strikes. I am anxious to see how it is done.
Look, I think they are getting ready to make the gems.

Indeed there seemed to be an air of expectancy among the diamond makers.
The mixing machine had now been stopped, and, as it was more quiet
in the cave, our friends, in their hiding-place, had to speak in mere
whispers. All the men were now gathered about the great steel box.

This receptacle had been closed by a solid metal door, which was screwed
and clamped tight. Then one of the men examined a number of heavily
insulated electric wires that extended from the box off into the
darkness where Tom and his companions could not discern them.

That's Folwell--the man I befriended, and who got me into this game,
 whispered Mr. Jenks. He was also one of the first to turn against me. I
think he's one of the leaders.

Folwell came back, after having gone into a dark part of the cave. He
went over to an electrical switch on one of the stone walls.

It's almost time, Tom heard him say to his confederates. The storm is
coming up rapidly.

Will it be severe enough? asked one of the helpers. We had all our
work for nothing last time. The flashes weren't heavy enough.

These will be, asserted Folwell. The indicator shows nearly a million
volts now, and it's increasing.

A million volts! exclaimed Tom. I hope it doesn't strike anywhere
around here.

Oh, it will probably be harmlessly conducted down on the heavy wires,
 said Mr. Parker. We are in no danger, at present, though ultimately I
expect to see the whole mountain shattered by a lightning bolt.

Cheerful prospect, murmured Tom.

There was a terrific crash outside. The rocky floor of the cave
trembled.

Here she comes! cried Folwell. Get back, everybody! I'm going to
throw over the switch now!

The men retreated well away from the steel box. Folwell threw over the
lever--the same one Mr. Jenks remembered pulling. Then the man ran
to the electric switch on the wall, and snapped that into place,
establishing a connection.

There was a moment's pause, as Folwell ran to join the others in their
place of safety. Then from without there came a most nerve-racking and
terrifying crash. It seemed as if the very mountain would be rent into
fragments.

Watching with eager eyes, the adventurers saw sparks flash from the
steel box. Instantly it became red hot, and then glowed white and
incandescent. It was almost at the melting point.

Then came comparative quiet, as the echoes of the thunder died away amid
the mountain peaks.

I guess that did the trick! cried Folwell. It was a terrific crash
all right!

He and the others ran forward. The steel box was now a cherry red,
for it was cooling. Folwell threw back the lever, and another man
disconnected the switch. There was a period of waiting until the box was
cool enough to open. Then the heavy door was swung back.

With a long iron rod Folwell drew something from the retort. It was the
tray which had held the white balls. But they were white no longer, for
they had been turned into diamonds. From their hiding-place Tom and the
others could see the flashing gems, for, in spite of the fact that the
diamonds were uncut, some of them sparkled most brilliantly, due to the
peculiar manner in which they were made.

We have the secret of the diamonds! whispered Mr. Jenks. There must
be a quart of the gems there!

The men gathered about Folwell, uttering exclamations of delight. The
diamonds were too hot to handle yet.

That's going some! exclaimed the chief of the diamond makers. We have
a small fortune here.

The was a sudden commotion at one end of the cave. A man rushed in. At
the sight of him Tom stared and uttered an exclamation.

Munson--the stowaway! he whispered.

Hello! cried Folwell, as he saw his confederate. I thought you were
East, keeping Jenks away from here.

He got the best of me! cried Munson, he and that Tom Swift! I stowed
away on their airship, but they found me out by a wireless message,
and marooned me in the woods. I've been trying to get here ever since!
Didn't you get my messages of warning?

No--what warnings? cried Folwell.

About Jenks, Tom Swift and the others. They're here--they must be on
Phantom Mountain now. In fact, I shouldn't be surprised if they were in
this cave. I traced them to their camp, but they're gone. They may be
among us now--in some of the secret recesses!

For an instant Folwell stared at the bearer of these tidings. Then he
cried out:

Scatter men, and find these fellows! We must get them before they
discover our secret!

It's too late--we know it! exulted Tom Swift. Then he whispered to
the others to hurry to the part of the cave where Bill Renshaw had first
hidden them.




CHAPTER XXII--PRISONERS


Do you think there is any danger of them finding us? asked Mr. Damon,
as he hurried along beside Tom.

I'm afraid so, was the answer. I've been worried ever since we saw
Munson heading this way. But we couldn't do any differently.

Perhaps Bill Renshaw may be able to conceal us, suggested Mr. Jenks.
Very likely he knows that Munson is on hand. Perhaps we will be safe
for a while. I want to make a few more observations as to how they
manufacture the diamonds, and then, with what I already know, I'll have
the secret.

And I'd like to make some scientific tests of the sides and bottom
rocks of the cave, spoke Mr. Parker. I think it will bear out my
theory that the mountain will soon be destroyed.

Well, you were right about Earthquake Island, and you may be right
about this mountain, said Tom, but if it is going to be annihilated I
hope we get far enough away from it.

We can keep our presence here a secret for a few more days, I think
that will be long enough, proceeded Mr. Jenks. Then we will leave.

And, in the meanwhile, they'll be searching for us, objected Mr.
Damon. I wish that ghost-chap would come back and tell us what to do.
Bless my liver-pin, but we are going to be in considerable danger, I'm
afraid! Those men may capture us, and decide to make diamond dust from
us.

Come on--hurry to the little cave, urged Tom. Then we'll get ready to
defend ourselves.

The main cave is a large one, said Mr. Jenks, and there are many
hiding places in it. In fact, it is so large that it will take those
fellows several days to complete a circuit of it. By that time Bill
Renshaw may come back, and take us to some place in which they have
already searched for us. Then we'll be comparatively safe.

This thought was some consolation to them, as they made their way
through the dark passage, dimly illuminated by the lantern they had
rekindled, to the place where Bill had hidden them. They found things
as they had left them, and proceeded to get a meal, though Tom said it
would be best not to cook anything, or even to make coffee, for fear the
odors would enable the searchers to trail them.

So they ate cold food, glad to get that. Silently they sat about the
dimly-lighted cavern, and discussed the situation. True they might even
now retreat, going out of the entrance Bill had showed them, and so
escape. But Mr. Jenks felt that his mission was not completed yet, and
they all agreed to stay with him.

For there are several points about making diamonds that are not
quite clear to me, he said. I need to know how that steel box is
constructed, how the electrical switches are arranged, what kind of
lightning rods they use, and how they regulate the pressure. The other
things, and how to mix the ingredients, I already know.

Then we'll do our best to help you, promised Tom. But now I think we
had better see what sort of a defense we can put up. We have our guns
and revolvers, and with these chairs and tables we can build a sort of
barricade behind which we can take refuge if those fellows do discover
our hiding place.

This was conceded to be a good idea, and soon a rude sort of fort was
made, behind which the adventurers could take their stand and fight, if
necessary, though they hoped this would not come to pass.

They remained quietly in the cave the remainder of that day, and, when
it was night, as they could tell by their timepieces--there was no
daylight--they divided the hours into watches, taking turns standing
guard.

Morning, at least in point of time, came without any disturbance, and
they made a cold breakfast. They hoped that Bill Renshaw would come, but
he did not appear.

After sitting in the dark cave until afternoon, Tom said:

I think we might as well go and take another observation of the big
cave. We can tell what the men are doing, then, for they don't seem to
have been near us. Maybe they have given up the search for us, and we
can see them at work, and Mr. Jenks can gain what further knowledge he
needs.

That will be a good plan, agreed the diamond man. It's maddening to
sit here, doing nothing.

And it will be comparatively safe to go from here to our former post of
observation, added Tom, for there doesn't seem to be any opening along
the tunnel, into the larger cave, except the place where we were.

Accordingly they started off. Cautiously they looked through the opening
into the apartment where they had seen the diamonds made.

There's not a soul here! exclaimed Tom, in a whisper. The others
looked. The place was deserted--the machinery silent. Mr. Jenks peered
in for a moment, and then exclaimed:

I'm going in! Now's my chance to find out all that I wish to know! It
may never come again, and then we can soon leave Phantom Mountain!

It was a daring plan, but it seemed to be the best one to follow. They
were all tired of inactivity. Mr. Jenks managed to get through the
opening, and dropped into the big cave. The others followed. Mr. Jenks
hurried over to the steel box, and began an examination of it. Tom Swift
was looking at the electrical switch. He saw how it was constructed. Mr.
Damon and Mr. Parker were peering interestedly about.

Suddenly the sound of voices was heard, and the echo of footsteps. Mr.
Jenks started.

They're coming back! he whispered hoarsely. Run!

They all turned and sped toward their hiding place. But they were too
late. An instant later Folwell, Munson and the other diamond makers
confronted them. Our friends made a bold rush, but were caught before
they could go ten feet.

We have them! cried Munson. They walked right into our hands!

It was true. Tom Swift and the others were the prisoners of the diamond
makers.



CHAPTER XXIII--BROKEN BONDS


Well, remarked Tom Swift, in mournful tones, this looks as if we were
up against it; doesn't it?

Bless my umbrella, it certainly does, agreed Mr. Damon.

And it's all my fault, said Mr. Jenks. I shouldn't have gone into the
big cave. I might have known those men would come back any time.

The above conversation took place as our friends lay securely bound in
a small cave, or recess, opening from the larger cavern, where, about
an hour before, they had been captured and made prisoners by the diamond
makers. Despite their struggles they had been overpowered and bound,
being carried to the cave, where they were laid in a row on some old
bags.

It certainly is a most unpleasant situation, to say the least,
 observed Mr. Parker.

And all my fault, repeated Mr. Jenks.

Oh, no it isn't, declared Tom Swift, quickly. We were just as ready
to follow you into that cave as you were to go. No one could tell that
the men would return so soon. It's nobody's fault. It's just our bad
luck.

From where he lay, tied hand and foot, the young inventor could look
out into the cave where he and the others had been caught. The diamond
makers were busily engaged, apparently in getting ready to manufacture
another batch of the precious stones. They paid little attention to
their captives, save to warn them, when they had first been taken into
the little cave, that it was useless to try to escape.

They needn't have told us that, observed Tom, as he and the others
were talking over their situation in low voices. I don't believe any
one could loosen these ropes.

They certainly are pretty tight, agreed Mr. Damon. I've been tugging
and straining at mine for the last half hour, and all I've succeeded in
doing is to make the cords cut into my flesh.

Better give it up, advised Mr. Jenks.

We'll just have to wait.

For what? the scientist wanted to know.

To see what they'll do with us. They can't keep us here forever.
They'll have to let us go some time. Following their capture, Folwell
and Munson, the latter the stowaway of the airship, had been in earnest
conversation regarding our friends, but what conclusion they had reached
the adventurers could only guess.

And we didn't have time to examine the diamond-making machinery close
enough so that we could duplicate it if necessary, complained Tom, a
little later.

No, agreed Mr. Jenks. There are certain things about it that are not
clear to me. Well, I don't believe I'll have another chance to inspect
it. They'll take good care of that, though they seem to be getting ready
to make more diamonds.

Perhaps they're going to manufacture a big batch, and then leave this
place, suggested Mr. Damon. They will probably go to some other secret
cave, and leave us here.

I hope they untie us before they leave, and give us something to eat,
 remarked the young inventor.

For two hours longer the captives lay there, in most uncomfortable
positions. Then Folwell and Munson, leaving the group of diamond makers
who were grouped about the machinery, approached the captives.

Well, remarked Munson, we got ahead of you after all; didn't we. You
thought you had our secret, but it will be a long while before you ever
make diamonds.

What are you going to do with us? asked Tom.

Never mind. You came where you had no right to, and you must take the
consequences.

We did have a right to come here! exclaimed Mr. Jenks. I am entitled
to know how the diamonds are made. I paid for the information, and you
tricked me. If ever it's possible I'll have the whole gang arrested for
swindling.

You'll never get the chance! declared Folwell. You were given some
diamonds for the money you invested, and that makes us square.

No, it doesn't! declared Mr. Jenks. I invested the money to learn how
to make diamonds, and you know it! You tricked me, and I had a right
to try to discover your secret! I nearly have it, too, and I'll get it
completely before I'm done with you!

No, you won't! boasted Folwell. But we didn't come here to tell you
that. We came to give you something to eat. We're not savages and
we'll treat you as well as we can in spite of the fact that you are
trespassers. We're going to give you some grub, but I warn you that any
attempt to escape will mean that some of you will get hurt.

He signalled to some of his confederates. These men unbound the
captives' arms, and stood over them while they ate some coarse food that
was brought into the small cave. They were given coffee to drink, and
then, when the simple meal was over, they were securely bound again,
and left to themselves, while the diamond makers went back to their
machinery.

It was evident that they were going to attempt a big operation, for an
unusually large quantity of the white stuff was prepared. The prisoners
watched them idly. They could see some but not all of the operations. In
this way several hours passed.

Gloom possessed the hearts of Tom and his friends. Not only had their
expedition been almost a failure so far, but the young inventor was
worried lest the gang might discover and wreck his airship. This would
prove a serious loss. Lying there in the semi-darkness the lad imagined
all sorts of unpleasant happenings.

At times he dozed off, as did the others. They had become somewhat used
to the pain caused by the bonds, for their nerves were numb from the
strain and pressure.

Once, as he was lightly sleeping, Tom was awakened by hearing loud
voices in the main cave. He looked out, rolling over slightly to get a
better view. He saw the man who, once before had run in to give news of
an approaching electrical storm.

Are you fellows all ready? asked this same man again.

Yes. Is there another storm coming?

Yes, and it's going to be a corker! was the reply. It's one of the
worst I've ever seen. It's sweeping right up the valley. It'll be here
in an hour.

That's good. We need a big flash to make all the material we have
prepared into diamonds. It's the biggest batch we ever tried. I hope it
succeeds, for we're going to leave-- The rest was in so low a tone that
Tom could not catch it.

The storm messenger departed. Folwell and Munson busied themselves about
the machinery. Tom dozed off again, dimly wondering what had become of
Bill Renshaw, and whether the former ghost knew of their plight. The
others were asleep, as the young inventor saw by the dim light of a
lantern in the cave. Then, he too, shut his eyes.

Tom was suddenly awakened by feeling some one's hands moving about his
clothing. At first he thought it was one of the diamond-making gang, who
had sneaked in to rob him. Here! What are you up to? exclaimed Tom.

Quiet! cautioned a voice. Are you all here?

All of us--yes. But who are you?

Easy--keep quiet, Tom Swift! I'm Bill Renshaw! I've been searching all
over for you, since I got back to your cave and found it empty. Now I'm
going to free you. I got in here by a secret entrance. Wait, I'll cut
your ropes. There was a slight sound, and an instant later Tom was
freed from his bonds.




CHAPTER XXIV--IN GREAT PERIL


The young inventor could scarcely believe the good luck that had so
unexpectedly come to him and his companions. No sooner was Tom able to
move freely about than Bill Renshaw performed the same service for Mr.
Jenks and the others, cautioning them to be quiet as he awakened them,
and cut the ropes.

Bless my circulation! exclaimed Mr. Damon, in a hoarse whisper. How
did you ever get here. I'd given ourselves up for lost.

Oh, I came in off the mountain, as there's a big storm due, explained
the man. There was no need of me playing the haunt in daytime, anyhow.
I went to the cave, found you and your things gone, and I surmised that
you might have walked into some trap.

We did, admitted Mr. Jenks, grimly.

Well, I hunted around until I found you, went on Bill. This mountain
is honeycombed with caves, all opening from the large one, I know them
better than these fellows do, so I could explore freely, and keep out of
their sight. They didn't know that there was a second entrance to this
place, but I did, and I made for it, when I couldn't find you in some of
the other caves where I looked. And, sure enough, here you were.

Well, we can't thank you enough, said Mr. Parker. But you say there
is a big storm coming?

One of the biggest that's been around these parts in some time,
 replied Bill.

Then perhaps the mountain will be destroyed, went on the scientist, as
calmly as if he had remarked that it might rain.

I hope nothing like that happens until we get away, spoke Mr. Damon,
fervently.

What had we better do? inquired Tom.

Get away, unless you want to discover some more of their secrets,
 advised Bill. Those fellows are planning something, but I can't find
out what it is. They are suspicious of me, I think. But they are up to
something, and I believe, it would be best for you to leave while you
have the chance. It may not be healthy to stay. That's why I did my best
to untie you.

We appreciate what you have done, declared Mr. Jenks, but I want my
rights. I must learn a few more facts about how to make diamonds from
lightning flashes, and then I will have the same secret they cheated me
out of. I think if we wait a while we may be able to see the parts of
the process that are not quite clear to us. What do you say, Tom Swift?

Well, I would like to learn the secret, replied the lad, and if Bill
thinks it's safe to stay here a while longer--

Oh, I guess it will be safe enough, was the reply. Those fellows
won't bother about you now that they are about to make some more
diamonds. Besides, they think you're all tied up. Yes, you can stay here
and watch, I reckon. I've got a couple of guns, and--

Then we'll stay, decided Tom. We can put up a better fight now.

Silently, in their prison, but which they could now leave whenever they
pleased, the adventurers watched the diamond makers once more. The same
process they had witnessed before was gone through with. The white balls
were put inside the steel box and sealed up. Then they waited for the
storm to reach its height.

That this would not be long was evidenced by the mutterings of thunder
which every moment grew louder. The outburst of electrical fury was
likely to take place momentarily, and that it would be unusually severe
was shown by the precautions taken by the diamond makers. They attached
a number of extra wires, and brought out some insulated, hard rubber
platforms, on which they themselves stood. Tom and Mr. Jenks were much
interested in watching this detail of the work, and sought to learn how
each part of the process was done.

I almost think we can make diamonds, Tom, when we get back to
civilization, whispered Mr. Jenks.

I hope we can, answered Tom, and we can't get back any too soon to
suit me. I want to be in my airship again.

I don't blame you. But look, they are getting ready to adjust the
switch.

The adventurers ceased their whispered talk, and eagerly watched the
diamond makers. Folwell and Munson were hurrying to and fro in the big
cave, attending to the adjustments of the machinery.

On your insulated plates--all of you, Folwell gave the order. This
is going to be a terrific storm. The gage shows twice the power we have
ever used, and it's creeping up every minute! We'll have more diamonds
than ever had before!

Yes, if the mountain isn't destroyed, added Mr. Parker, in a low
voice. I predict that it will be split from top to bottom!

Comforting, thought Tom, grimly.

I guess we're all ready, said Folwell, in a low tone to Munson. We'd
better get insulated ourselves. I'm going to throw the switch.

He did so. A moment later the man who had before given warning of the
storm came dashing in. He was very much excited.

It's awful! he cried. The lightning is striking all over! Big rocks
are being split like logs of wood!

Well, it can't do any damage in here, said Munson. We are well
protected. Get on one of the plates, and he motioned to one of the
hard-rubber platforms that was not occupied. The roar and rumble of the
storm outside had given place to short terrific crashes. In their small
cave the adventurers could feel the solid ground shake.

A bluish light began dancing about the electrical wires. There was a
smell of sulphur in the air. Crash after crash resounded outside. A
flash of flame lit up the whole interior of the cave. It came from the
copper switch.

Something's wrong with the insulation! cried Munson.

Don't go near it! yelled Folwell. If you value your life, stand
still!

Hardly had he spoken than inside the cavern there sounded a report like
that of a small cannon. A big ball of fire danced about the middle of
the cave and then leaped on top of the steel box.

This is a fearful storm, cried Munson.

The adventurers in the cave did not know what to say or do. They were in
deadly peril.

Suddenly there came a crash louder than any that had preceded it. The
whole side of the cave where the switches were was a mass of bluish
flame. Then came a ripping, tearing sound, and a tangle of wires and
copper connections were thrown to the floor. At the same time the steel
box, containing the materials from which diamonds were made, turned
blue, and flames shot from it.

It's all up with us! cried Munson. Run for it, everybody! The wires
are down, and this place will be an electric furnace in another minute!

He leaped toward the exit from the cave.

What about those fellows? asked Folwell, indicating the place where
Tom and the others had been tied.

They'll have to do the best they can! It's every man for himself, now!
 yelled Munson. There was a wild scramble from the cavern.

Come on! cried Tom. We must escape! It's our only chance!

He leaped into the big cave, followed by the others. Already long
tongues of electrical fire were shooting out from the walls and roof as
Tom Swift and his companions, evading them as best they could, sought
safety in flight.



CHAPTER XXV--THE MOUNTAIN SHATTERED--CONCLUSION


Can't we get some of the diamonds? cried Mr. Damon, as he raced along
behind Tom. Now's our chance. Those fellows have all gone! The odd man
made a grab for something as he ran.

It's as much as our lives are worth, declared the young inventor. We
dare not stop! Come on!

I'd like to investigate some of the machinery, spoke Mr. Jenks, but I
wouldn't stop, even for that.

The storm is too dangerous, called Bill Renshaw. I can show you a
shorter way out than the one those fellows have taken. Follow me.

No way can be too short, said Mr. Parker, solemnly. This mountain
will go to pieces shortly, I think!

Tom shuddered. He remembered how narrow had been their escape when
Earthquake Island sank into the sea. And that some terrific upheaval was
now imminent might be judged from the awful reports that sounded more
plainly as the adventurers raced toward the opening of the cave. It was
like the bombardment of some doomed city.

Mr. Jenks and Tom cast one longing look behind at the complicated and
expensive machinery that had been installed in the cave by the diamond
makers. They had abandoned it, and in it lay the secret of making
precious gems. But there was no time to stop now, and investigate.

This way, urged Bill Renshaw. We'll soon be out.

But won't it be dangerous to go outside? asked Mr. Damon. Shan't we
be struck by lightning? There is some protection in here.

None at all, said Mr. Parker, quickly. This mountain is a natural
lightning rod. To stay here in this cave will be sure death when the
storm gets directly over it. And that will be very soon. We must get
on insulated ground. Is there any part of this mountain that does not
contain iron ore? the scientist asked of the former spirit.

Yes; the way out by which we are going lands on a dirt hill.

That's good; then we may be saved.

On they ran. They had no lanterns, but the blue light of the
electricity, as it leaped from point to point inside the cave, where
there were outcroppings of iron ore, made the place bright enough to
see.

Here we are! cried Bill Renshaw at length. Here's the way out!

Making a sudden turn in the winding passage he showed the adventurers
a small opening in the side of the crag. In an instant they had passed
through, and found themselves in daylight once more. The sudden glare
almost blinded them, for, though the sky was overcast by clouds, from
which jagged tongues of lightning played, the outside was much lighter
than the dark cave.

I should say it was a storm! cried Tom Swift. See, it is striking
every minute, and all around us!

In fact, lightning bolts were falling on every side of the adventurers.
Every time the balls of fire struck, they burst open great stones,
or seared a livid scar on the face of some cliff. As for Tom and the
others, they stood on a dry dirt hill, in which, fortunately, there was
no iron ore. To this fact they undoubtedly owed their lives, though
had there been rain, to moisten the ground and make the earth a good
conductor of electricity, they probably would have been badly shocked.
But the electrical outburst was not accompanied by rain.

Tom looked up. He saw a compact mass of cloud moving toward the summit
of the mountain on the slope of which they stood. From this cloud there
played shafts of reddish-green fire.

Look! called the young inventor to Mr. Parker. The instant the latter
saw the cloud, he cried:

We must get away from here by all means! That is the center of the
storm. As soon as it gets over the mountain, where that lightning rod
is, all the electrical fluid will be discharged in one bolt at the
mountain, and it will be destroyed! We must run, but keep on the dirt
places! Run for your lives!

They needed no second warning. Turning, they fled down the steep side of
the mountain, slipping and stumbling, but taking care not to step on any
iron ore. Behind them flashed the lightning bolts.

Suddenly there was a most awful crash. It seemed as if the end of the
world had come, and the ear drums of Tom and his companion almost burst
with the fearful report. The concussion knocked them down, and they lay
stunned for a moment.

Following the terrible report there was a low, rumbling sound. Hardly
knowing whether he was dead or alive, Tom opened his eyes and looked
about him. What he saw caused him to cry out in terror.

The whole mountain seemed bathed in fire. Great blue, red and green
flashes played around it. Then the towering cliff seemed to melt and
crumble up, and the great peak, the top of it containing the diamond
makers' cave, from which they had fled but a few minutes before, the
entire summit was toppled over into the valley on the other side, and in
the direction opposite to that where the adventurers stood.

Then came a profound silence, and the lightning ceased. The storm was
over, and only the rattle of stones and boulders, as they came to rest
in the valley below, reached the ears of our friends.

Phantom Mountain has been destroyed, just as I said it would be, spoke
Mr. Parker, solemnly. Once more he had prophesied correctly.

For a few minutes the adventurers hardly knew what to say. They arose
awkwardly from the ground where the shock had tossed them. Then Tom
remarked, as calmly as possible:

Well, it's all over. I guess we may as well get back to our airship.

What became of Munson and the others? asked Mr. Damon.

Mr. Jenks pointed to the trail, far below. The figures of some men,
running madly, could be seen.

There they go, he said; I fancy we have seen the last of them. And
they had, for some time at least.

There was little use lingering any longer on Phantom Mountain--indeed
little of it was left on which to remain. Looking back toward the place
where the cave had been, Tom and the others started forward again.
The diamond-making machinery had all been destroyed. So, also, had the
finished diamonds stored in the cavern and the large supply which had
probably been made by the last terrific crash. No one would ever have
them now. Tom and Mr. Jenks felt a sense of disappointment, but they
were glad to have escaped with their lives. They sought their former
camp, but the tent and all their food was buried under tons of earth and
rocks.

Three days later, after rather severe hardships, they were near the
place where they had left the Red Cloud. They had suffered cold and
hunger, for they had no food supplies, and, had it not been that Bill
Renshaw knew the haunts of some game, of which they managed to snare
some, they would have fared badly, for they had left their guns in the
cave.

Well, there are the trees behind which I hope my airship is hidden,
 announced Tom, as they came to the spot. Good old Red Cloud! Maybe we
won't do some eating when we get aboard, eh?

Bless my appetite! but we certainly will! cried Mr. Damon.

There's somebody walking around the place, spoke Mr. Jenks.

I hope it's no one who has damaged the ship, came from Tom,
apprehensively. He broke into a run, and soon confronted an aged miner,
who seemed to have established a rude sort of camp near the airship.

Is anything the matter? asked Tom, breathlessly. Is my airship all
right?

I guess she's all right, stranger, was the reply. I don't know much
about these contraptions, but I haven't touched her. I knowed she was an
airship, for I've seen pictures of 'em, and I've been waiting until the
owner came along.

Why? asked Tom, wonderingly.

Because I've got a proposition to make to you, went on the miner, who
said his name was Abe Abercrombie. I've been a miner for a good many
years, and I'm just back from Alaska, prospecting around here. I haven't
had any luck, but I know of a gold mine in Alaska that will make us all
rich. Only it needs an airship to get to it, and I've been figuring how
to hire one. Then I comes along, and I sees this big one, and I makes up
my mind to stay here until the owners come back. That's what I've done.
Now, if I prove that I'm telling the truth, will you go to Alaska--to
the valley of gold with me?

I don't know, answered Tom, to whom the proposition was rather sudden.
We've just had some pretty startling adventures, and we're almost
starved. Wait until we get something to eat, and we'll talk. Come aboard
the Red Cloud, and the lad led the way to his craft which was in as
good condition as when he left it to go to the diamond cave. Later he
listened to the miner's story.

Tom Swift did go to the valley of gold in Alaska, and what happened to
him and his companions there will be told of in the next volume of this
series, to be called Tom Swift in the Caves of Ice; or, the Wreck of
the Airship.

It did not take our friends long, after they had eaten a hearty meal,
to generate some fresh gas, and start the Red Cloud on her homeward way.
Tom wanted to take Bill Renshaw with him, but the old man said he would
rather remain among the mountains where he had been born. So, after
paying him well for his services, they said good-by to him. Abercrombie,
the miner, also remained behind, but promised to call and see Tom in a
few months.

Well, we didn't make any money out of this trip, observed Mr. Jenks,
rather dubiously, as they were nearing Shopton, after an uneventful
trip. I guess I owe you considerable, Tom Swift. I promised to get you
a lot of diamonds, but all I have are those I had from my first visit to
the cave.

Oh, that's all right, spoke Tom, easily. The experience was worth all
the trip cost.

Speaking of diamonds, look here! exclaimed Mr. Damon, suddenly, and he
pulled out a double handful.

Where did you get them? cried the others in astonishment.

I grabbed them up, as we ran from the cave, said the eccentric man;
but, bless my gaiters! I forgot all about them until you spoke. We'll
share them.

These diamonds, some of which were large, proved very valuable, though
the total sum was far below what Mr. Jenks hoped to make when he started
on the remarkable trip. Tom gave Mary Nestor a very fine stone, and it
was set in a ring, instead of a pin, this time.

On their arrival in Shopton, where Mr. Swift, the housekeeper, Mr.
Jackson and Eradicate Sampson were much alarmed for Tom's safety, an
attempt was made to manufacture diamonds, using a powerful electric
current instead of lightning. But it was not a success, and so Mr. Jenks
concluded to give up his search for the secret which was lost on Phantom
Mountain.

And now we will take leave of Tom Swift, to meet him again soon in other
adventures he is destined to have in the caves of ice and the valley of
gold.

CHAPTER I

ERADICATE IN AN AIRSHIP


"Well, Massa Tom, am yo' gwine out in yo' flyin' machine ag'in to-day?"

"Yes, Rad, I think I will take a little flight. Perhaps I'll go over
to Waterford, and call on Mr. Damon. I haven't seen very much of
him, since we got back from our hunt after the diamond-makers."

"Take a run clear ober t' Waterfield; eh, Massa Tom?"

"Yes, Rad. Now, if you'll help me, I'll get out the Butterfly, and
see what trim she's in for a speedy flight."

Tom Swift, the young inventor, aided by Eradicate Sampson, the
colored helper of the Swift household, walked over toward a small
shed.

A few minutes later the two had rolled into view, on its three
bicycle wheels, a trim little monoplane--one of the speediest craft
of the air that had ever skimmed along beneath the clouds. It was
built to carry two, and had a very powerful motor.

"I guess it will work all right," remarked the young inventor, for
Tom Swift had not only built this monoplane himself, but was the
originator of it, and the craft contained many new features.

"It sho' do look all right, Massa Tom."

"Look here, Rad," spoke the lad, as a sudden idea came to him,
"you've never ridden in an airship, have you?"

"No, Massa Tom, an' I ain't gwine to nuther!"

"Why not?"

"Why not? 'Case as how it ain't healthy; that's why!"

"But I go in them frequently, Eradicate. So does my father. You've
seen us fly often enough, to know that it's safe. Why, look at the
number of times Mr. Damon and I have gone off on trips in this
little Butterfly. Didn't we always come back safely?"

"Yes, dat's true, but dere might come a time when yo' WOULDN'T come
back, an' den where'd Eradicate Sampson be? I axes yo' dat--whar'd I
be, Massa Tom?"

"Why, you wouldn't be anywhere if you didn't go, of course," and Tom
laughed. "But I'd like to take you for a little spin in this
machine, Rad. I want you to get used to them. Sometime I may need
you to help me. Come, now. Suppose you get up on this seat here, and
I promise not to go too high until you get used to it. Come on, it
will do you good, and think of what all your friends will say when
they see you riding in an airship."

"Dat's right, Massa Tom. Dey suah will be monstrous envious ob
Eradicate Sampson, dat's what dey will."

It was clear that the colored man was being pursuaded somewhat
against his will. Though he had been engaged by Tom Swift and his
father off and on for several years, Eradicate had never shown any
desire to take a trip through the air in one of the several craft
Tom owned for this purpose. Nor had he ever evinced a longing for a
trip under the ocean in a submarine, and as for riding in Tom's
speedy electric car--Eradicate would as soon have sat down with
thirteen at the table, or looked at the moon over the wrong
shoulder.

But now, somehow, there was a peculiar temptation to take his young
employer at his word. Eradicate had seen, many times, the youthful
inventor and his friends make trips in the monoplane, as well as in
the big biplane and dirigible balloon combined--the RED CLOUD. Tom
and the others had always come back safely, though often they met
with accidents which only the skill and daring of the daring
aeronaut had brought to a safe conclusion.

"Well, are you coming, Rad?" asked Tom, as he looked to see if the
oil and gasoline tanks were filled, and gave a preliminary twirl to
the propeller.

"Now does yo' t'ink it am puffickly safe, Massa Tom?" and the
colored man looked nervously at the machine.

"Of course, Rad. Otherwise I wouldn't invite you. But I won't take
you far. I just want you to get used to it, and, once you have made
a flight, you'll want to make another."

"I don't nohow believe I will, Massa Tom, but as long as you have
axed me, an' as yo' say some of dem proud, stuck-up darkies in
Shopton will be tooken down a peg or two when de sees me, vhy, I
will go wif yo', Massa Tom."

"I thought you would. Now take your place in the little seat next to
where I'm going to sit. I'll start the engine and jump in. Now sit
perfectly still, and, whatever you do, don't jump out. The ground's
pretty hard this morning. There was a frost last night."

"I knows dere was, Massa Tom. Nope, I won't jump. I--I--Oh, golly,
Massa Tom! I guess I don't want to go--let me out!"

Eradicate, his heart growing fainter as the time of starting drew
nearer, made as if he would leave the monoplane, in which he had
taken his seat.

"Sit still!" yelled Tom. At that instant he started the propeller.
The motor roared like a salvo of guns, and streaks of fire could be
seen shooting from one cylinder to the other, until there was a
perfect blast of explosions.

The speed of the propeller increased as the motor warmed up. Tom ran
to his seat and opened the gasoline throttle still more, advancing
the spark slightly. The roar increased. The lad darted a look at
Eradicate. The colored man's face was like chalk, and he was
gripping the upright braces at his side as though his salvation
depended on them.

"Steady now" spoke Tom, yelling to be heard above the racket. "Here
we go."

The Butterfly was moving slowly across the level stretch of ground
which Tom used for starting his airships. The propeller was now a
blur of light. The explosions of the motor became a steady roar, the
noise from one cylinder being merged into the blast from the others
so rapidly that it was a continuous racket.

With a whizz the monoplane shot across the ground. Then, with a
quick motion, Tom tilted the lifting planes, and, as gracefully as a
bird, the little machine mounted upward on a slant until, coming to
a level about two hundred feet above the earth, Tom sent it straight
ahead over the roof of his house.

"How's this, Rad?" he cried. "Isn't it great?"

"It--it--er--bur-r-r-r! It's--it's mighty ticklish, Massa Tom--dat's
de word--it suah am mighty ticklish!"

Tom Swift laughed and increased the speed. The Butterfly darted
forward like some hummingbird about to launch itself upon a flower,
and, indeed, the revolutions of the propeller were not unlike the
vibrations of the wings of that marvelous little creature.

"Now for some corkscrew twists!" cried the young inventor. "Here we
go, Rad!"

With that he began a series of intricate evolutions, making figures
of eight, spirals, curves, sudden dips and long swings. It was
masterwork in handling a monoplane, but Eradicate Sampson, as he sat
crouched in the seat, gripping the uprights until his hands ached,
was in no condition to appreciate it. Gradually, however, as he saw
that the craft remained up in the air, and showed no signs of falling,
the fears of the colored man left him. He sat up straighter.

"Don't you like it, Rad?" cried Tom.

This time the answer came with more decision.

"It suah am great, Massa Tom! I'm--I'm beginnin' t' like it. Whoop!
I guess I do like it! Now if some of dem stuck-up coons could see
me--"

"They'd think YOU were stuck up; eh, Rad? Stuck up in the air!"

"Dat's right, Massa Tom. Ha! Ha! I suah am stuck up in de air! Ha!
Ha!"

By this time Tom had guided the machine away from the village, and
they were flying over the fields, some distance from his house. The
colored man was beginning to enjoy his experience very much.

Suddenly, just as Tom was trying to get a bit more speed out of the
motor, the machine stopped. The cessation of the racket was almost
as startling as a loud explosion would have been.

"Just my luck!" cried Tom.

"What's de matter?" asked Eradicate, anxiously.

"Motor's stalled," replied the young inventor.

"An', by golly, we's falling!" yelled the colored man.

Naturally, with the stopping of the propeller, there was no further
straight, forward motion to the monoplane, and, following the law of
nature, it began to drop toward the earth on a slant.

"We's fallin'! We'll be killed!" yelled the negro.

"It's all right, I'll just vol-plane back to earth," spoke Tom,
calmly. "I've often done it before, higher up than this. Sit still,
Rad, I'm volplaning back to the ground."

"An' I'll JUMP back to de ground; dat's what I'll do. I ain't goin'
t' wait until I falls, no sah! An' I ain't gwine t' do none ob dat
ball-playin' yo' speak ob, Massa Swift. It's no time t' play ball
when yo' life am in danger. I'se gwine t' jump."

"Sit still!" cried Tom, for the colored man was about to spring from
his seat. "There's no danger! I didn't say anything about playing
ball. I said I'd VOL-PLANE back to the earth. We'll be there
shortly. I'll take you down safe. Sit still, Rad!"

He spoke so earnestly that the fears of his colored passenger were
quelled. With a quick motion Tom threw up the head planes, to check
the downward sweep. The Butterfly shot forward on a gradual slant.
Repeating this maneuver several times, the young inventor finally
brought his machine to within a short distance of the earth, and,
also, considerably nearer his own home.

"I wonder if we can make it?" he murmured, measuring the distance
with his eye. "I think so. I'll shoot her up a bit and then let her
down on a long slant. Then, with another upward tilt, I ought to
fetch it."

The monoplane tilted upward. Eradicate gave a cry of terror. It was
stilled at a look from Tom. Once more the air machine glided
forward. Then came another long dip, another upward glide and the
Butterfly came gently to earth almost on the very spot whence it had
flown upward a few minutes before.

Eradicate gave one mad spring from his seat, almost before the
bicycle wheels had ceased revolving, as Tom jammed on the earth-brake.

"Here, where are you going, Rad?" cried the lad.

"Whar am I goin'? I'se goin' t' see if mah mule Boomerang am safe.
He's de only kind ob an airship I wants arter dis!" and the colored
man disappeared into the shack whence came a loud "hee-haw!"

"Oh, pshaw! Wait a minute, Rad. I'll soon have the motor fixed, and
we'll make another try. I'll take you over to Mr. Damon's with me."

"No, sah, Massa Tom. Yo' don't catch dis coon in any mo' airships.
Mah mule am good enough fo' me!" shouted Eradicate from the safe
harbor of the mule's stable.

Tom laughed, and turned to inspect the motor. As he was looking it
over, to locate the trouble, the door of the house opened and a
pleasant-faced woman stepped out.

"Oh, Tom," she called. "I looked for you a moment ago, and you
weren't here!"

"No, Mrs. Baggert," Tom replied, waving his hand in greeting to the
housekeeper, "Rad and I just came back--quite suddenly--sooner than
we expected to. Why? Did you want me?"

"Here's a letter that came for you," she went on.

Tom tore open the envelope, and rapidly scanned the contents of the
missive.

"Hello!" he ejaculated half aloud. "It's from Abe Abercrombie, that
miner I met when we were after the diamond-makers! He says he is on
his way east to get ready to start on the quest for the Alaskan
valley of gold, in the caves of ice. I had almost forgotten that I
promised to make the attempt in the big airship. How did this letter
come, Mrs. Baggert?" he asked.

"By special delivery. The messenger brought it a few minutes ago."

"Then we may see Abe any day now. Guess I'd better be looking over
the RED CLOUD to see if it's in shape for a trip to the Arctic
regions."

Tom's attention for the moment was taken off his little monoplane,
and his memory went back to the strange scenes in which he and his
friends had recently played a part, in searching for the cave of the
diamond-makers on Phantom Mountain. He recalled the promise he had
made to the old miner.

"I wonder if he expects us to start for Alaska with winter coming
on?" thought Tom.

His musings were suddenly interrupted by the entrance into the yard,
surrounding the aeroplane shed, of a lad about his own age.

"Hello, Ned Newton!" called Tom, heartily.

"Hello, yourself," responded Ned. "I've got a day off from the bank,
and I thought I'd come over and see you. Say, have you heard the
latest?"

"No. What is it?"

"Andy Foger is building an airship."

"Andy Foger building an airship?"

"Yes, he says it will beat yours."

"Humph! It will, eh? Well, Andy can do as he pleases as long as he
doesn't bother me. I won't be around here much longer, anyhow."

"Why not, Tom?"

"Because I soon expect to start for the far north on a strange
quest. Come on in the shed, and I'll tell you about it. We're going
to try to locate a valley of gold, and I guess Andy Foger won't
follow me there, even if he does build an airship."

Tom and his chum started toward the shed, the young inventor still
holding the letter that was to play such an important part in his
life within the next few months. And, had he only known it, the
building of Andy Foger's airship was destined to be fraught with
much danger to our hero.




CHAPTER II

ANDY FOGER'S TRIPLANE


"Going to look for a valley of gold, eh?" remarked Ned Newton as he
and Tom took seats in a little room, fitted up like a den, where the
young inventor frequently worked out the details of the problems
that confronted him. "Where is this valley, Tom? Anywhere so I could
have a chance at it?"

"It's up in Alaska. Just where I don't know, but Abe Abercrombie,
the old miner whom we met when out in Colorado this summer, says he
can find it if we circle around in the airship. So I'm going to take
a chance. I'll tell you all about it."

And, while Tom is doing this, I will take the opportunity to more
formally introduce to my new readers our hero and his friends.

Tom Swift was an inventor of no little note, in spite of his youth.
He lived with his father, Barton Swift, who was also an inventor, on
the outskirts of the village of Shopton, New York State. Tom's
mother was dead, and Mrs. Baggert had kept house for him and his
father since he was a child. Garret Jackson, an expert machinist,
was also a member of the household, and as has been explained,
Eradicate Sampson, who took that name because, as he said he
"eradicate de dirt," was also a sort of retainer. He lived in a
little house on the Swift grounds, and did odd jobs about the place.

In the first book of the series, entitled "Tom Swift and His Motor
Cycle," there was related how the lad became possessed of one of
those speedy machines, after Mr. Wakefield Damon had come to grief
on it. Mr. Damon was an eccentric man, who was always blessing
himself, some part of his anatomy, or some of his possessions.

After many adventures on his motor-cycle, Tom Swift went through
some surprising happenings with a motor-boat he bought. After that
he built an airship, the RED CLOUD, and later he and his father
constructed a submarine, in which they went under the ocean in
search of sunken treasure, enduring many perils and much danger.

Tom Swift's electric runabout, which he built after returning home
from the submarine trip, proved to be the speediest car on the road.
The experience he acquired in making this machine stood him in good
stead, when (as told in the sixth volume, "Tom Swift and His
Wireless Message") the airship in which he, Mr. Damon and a friend
of the latter's (who had built the craft) were wrecked on Earthquake
Island. There Tom was marooned with some refugees from a wrecked
steam yacht, among whom were Mr. and Mrs. Nestor, father of a girl
of whom Tom thought a great deal.

With parts from the wrecked electric airship the youth rigged up a
plant, and sent wireless messages from the island. The castaways
nearly lost their lives in the earthquake shocks, but a steamer,
summoned by Tom's wireless call, arrived in time to save them, just
as the island disappeared beneath the sea.

In the seventh book of the series, entitled "Tom Swift Among the
Diamond Makers" there was related the adventures of himself and his
friends when they tried to solve the mystery of Phantom Mountain.

Among the castaways of Earthquake Island was a Mr. Barcoe Jenks and
a Professor Ralph Parker. Mr. Jenks was a strange man, and claimed
to have some valuable diamonds, which he said were made by a gang of
men hidden in a cave in the Rocky Mountains. Tom did not believe
that the diamonds were real, but Mr. Jenks soon proved that they
were.

He asked Tom to aid him in searching for the cave of the diamond
makers. Mr. Jenks had been there once--in fact, he had been offered
a partnership in the diamond-making business, but, after he had paid
his money, he had been drugged, and carried secretly from the cave
before he had a chance to note its location.

But he, together with Tom, Mr. Damon and the scientist Mr. Parker,
who correctly predicted the destruction of Earthquake Island, set
out in the RED CLOUD to find the diamond makers. They did find them,
after many hardships, and were captured by the gang. How Tom and his
friends escaped from the cave, after they had seen diamonds made by
a powerful lightning flash, and how they nearly lost their lives
from the destruction of Phantom Mountain, is fully set down in the
book.

Sufficient to say now, that, though they had a general idea of how
the precious stones were made, by the power of the lightning, the
young inventor and his friends were never quite able to accomplish
it, and the secret remained a secret. But they had secured some
diamonds as they rushed from the cave (Mr. Damon grabbing them up)
and these were divided among Tom and the others.

Just as they were ready to come home in the airship, our friends
were met by an old miner, Abe Abercrombie, who spoke of a valley of
gold in Alaska, which was the story Tom related to Ned Newton, as
the two chums sat in the den of the airship shed.

"Then you don't know all the details about the gold valley, Tom?"
remarked Ned, as the young inventor showed his chum the letter that
had just arrived.

"No, not all of them. At the time this miner met us I was anxious to
get back East, for we had been away so long I knew dad would be
worried. But I listened to part of Abe's story, and half promised to
go in partnership in this quest for gold. He was to furnish
information about the hidden valley, and I was to supply the
airship. I expect Abe to come along at any time, now, and then I'll
hear more particulars."

"Will you go all the way in the airship?"

"Well, I hadn't thought of that. I could ship it to the nearest
place by rail, I suppose, and go on from there. That's a detail to
be considered later. I'll talk it over with Abe."

"Who are going?"

"I don't know that even. I suppose Mr. Damon would feel slighted if
I left him out. And perhaps Mr. Parker, that gloomy scientist, who
is always predicting terrible accidents, will be glad to go along.
Then Abe may have some friend he wants to take."

"By Jinks! But you certainly do have swell times, Tom Swift!"
exclaimed Ned Newton, enviously. "I wish I could go and have a try
at that valley of gold!"

"Why don't you come along, Ned?"

"Do you really mean it?"

"Of course."

"But I don't believe I could get away from the bank."

"Oh, dad and Mr. Damon could fix that. They're directors, you know.
Come along, I'd be delighted to have you. Will you?"

"I'll think about it. Jinks! But I sure would like to go. Do you
think you can find the valley?"

"Well, there's no telling. We generally do succeed in finding what
we go after, even if we didn't get the diamond secret. I'm anxious
to have Abe come, now, though until I got his letter I had almost
forgotten about my promise to him. But, say, what's this you told me
about Andy Foger making an airship?"

"It's true, though I haven't seen it. Jake Porter was telling me
about it. Andy's built a big shed in his yard, and he and some
cronies of his, including Pete Bailey and Sam Snedecker, are working
in there night and day. They've hired a couple of machinists, too.
Mr. Foger is putting up the cash, I guess. Say, that was quite a
scare you gave Andy on your monoplane, one day."

"Yes, the big bully! and I'd like to scare him worse. But say, do
you know I'd like to get a look at his airship. I wonder what sort
of a craft it is?"

"We can see it easily enough."

"How?"

"Why, the back part of the shed where he and the others are working
is close to our fence. There are some holes in our fence and if you
come there, maybe you can look in."

"I can't see through the side of the shed, though."

"Yes, you can."

"How?"

"Why, there's a big window, for light, in the back part of it. I
happened to notice it the other day. I didn't look in, because I
wasn't much interested, but I saw that one could peer over the top
of our fence right into the shop where Andy is working. Want to try
it?"

Tom hesitated a moment.

"Well, it seems rather an odd thing to do," he said. "But I would
like to see what sort of a flying machine Andy is making, just for
my own satisfaction. He may be infringing on some of my patents, and
if he is, I'll stop him. Once or twice he's been sneaking around my
shed here. I don't believe in sneaking, but I know he wouldn't let
me in if I asked him, so I guess it's the only way. I'll go with
you, Ned."

"All right. We'll see if we can get a glimpse of Andy's queer
shebang through the window."

The two chums left Tom's shop, and were soon in the yard of Ned
Newton's house. As he had said, the big shed in Andy's premises came
close up to the fence, and there was a window through which one
might gaze. The casement did not appear to be curtained.

"I'll get a ladder so we can climb up to the top of the fence, and
look over," spoke Ned, as he and Tom went out into the yard back of
his house. The fence was high up on an embankment.

A little later Tom and his chum were gazing into the shop window
from the ladder.

"Why, it's a triplane--a big triplane!" he exclaimed.

"What's a triplane?" asked Ned, who didn't have much time to study
the different types of airships.

"It's one that has three sets of planes, one above the other. A
biplane has two sets of planes, and a monoplane only one. Triplanes
are larger, and, as far as I've been able to learn, not as
satisfactory as either the biplanes or monoplanes. But that's not
saying Andy's won't be a success. They certainly are busy in there,
though! Andy is flying around like a hen scratching for her little
chickens!"

"See anything of his cronies?"

"Yes, Pete and Sam are hammering away. There are a couple of men,
too."

"Yes, the machinists. Oh, I guess Andy expects great things from his
airship."

"Have you heard what he's going to do with it, Ned? Make flights for
pleasure, or exhibit it?"

"No, I haven't heard. Look out, Tom, the ladder is slipping!"

As Ned spoke this warning, the window of the airship shed, through
which they were looking, was suddenly raised. The ugly face of Andy
Foger peered out. He caught sight of Tom and Ned.

"Get away from there, you spies!" he yelled. "Get away from there,
Tom Swift! You're trying to steal some of my ideas! Get away or I'll
make you. Sam, bring me my gun! Pete, go tell my father to come
here! I'll show Ned Newton and Tom Swift they can't bother me!"

Andy was dancing about in a rage. His two cronies crowded behind him
to the window just as the ladder on which Tom and Ned were standing
slipped along the fence.

"Jump, Ned!" yelled Tom Swift, as he leaped away to escape being
entangled in the rungs.

The young inventor came to the ground with a jar that shook him up
considerably, while Ned, who had grasped the top board of the fence,
remained hanging there by his hands, his feet dangling in the air.

"Whack his fingers, Andy!" yelled Pete Bailey. "Get a long stick and
whack Ned's fingers! That will make him drop off!"

Tom Swift heard, and labored desperately to raise the ladder to
enable Ned to get down, for his chum seemed to be afraid to drop.




CHAPTER III

ABE IS DECEIVED


Raising a ladder alone is rather an awkward job. Tom found this so
when he tried to aid his friend Ned. But, being a muscular lad, the
young inventor did finally succeed in getting the ladder up against
the fence where the bank clerk could reach it.

Whack! Down upon the top board came a stick wielded by Andy Foger
from the rear window of his shop.

"Wow!" cried Ned, for the blow had been close to his fingers. "Hurry
up with that ladder, Tom."

"There it is! But why don't you drop?"

"Too far. I can't reach the ladder now!"

"Yes, you can. Stretch a bit!"

"Whack!" Once more the stick descended on the fence, this time still
closer to Ned's clinging hands.

"Hit him good, Andy!" cried Sam Snedecker, "Give me a shot at him!"

"I will not. I want to attend to him myself. You go tell my father,
and he'll have Tom Swift arrested for trying to sneak in and get
some of my airship ideas!"

By this time Ned's wiggling feet had found the topmost rung of the
ladder. The next moment he was rapidly descending it, and, when on
the ground, he and Tom carried it away, to prevent its use by the
enemy.

"Whew!" exclaimed the young inventor. "I had no idea they would kick
up such a row!"

"Me either. Did you hurt yourself when you jumped, as the ladder
fell?"

"No. Did they hit your hands?"

"Came mighty near it. Well, I s'pose it serves us right, yet if I
can't look over my own back fence it's a pity!"

"Of course we can, only I'd just as soon they hadn't seen us.
However--hello! there's Andy looking over here, now."

The mean face of the bully now topped the fence. It was evident that
he had crawled from the window of his shop.

"What are you trying to get into my place for, Tom Swift?" he
demanded.

"I wasn't trying to get in, Andy Foger."

"Well, you were looking in."

"Only doing as you've done over at my shop, several times, Andy. I
wanted to see what sort of an airship you were building."

"Trying to get some ideas for your own, I guess," sneered Andy.

Tom did not think it worth while to answer this taunt.

"I could have you arrested for this," went on Andy, who felt bolder
now that he was reinforced by Sam and Pete on either side of him as
he looked over the fence into Ned's yard.

"Arrested for what?" demanded the bank clerk.

"For trespassing on my father's premises," went on Andy.

"We weren't on your premises," declared Ned. "We were on our side of
the fence all the while."

"Well, you were looking over in my yard."

"A cat may look at a king, you know, Andy," Tom reminded the bully.

"Yah! Think you're smart, don't you! Well, you can't steal any of my
ideas for an airship. They're all patented, and I'll soon be making
longer and higher flights than you ever dreamed of! I'll show you
what a real airship is, Tom Swift! Monoplanes and biplanes are out
of date. The only thing that's any good is a triplane. If mine works
well--and I'm sure it will--I may build a quadruplane!"

"I wish you luck," spoke Tom, with a shrug of his shoulders.

"Well, you won't have any luck if you come around here any more,"
went on Pete Bailey. "We'll be on the watch for you fellows, now,
and we'll cover this window, so you can't see in."

"That's what we will," agreed Andy, and Sam Snedecker shook his head
vigorously to indicate that he, too, approved of this.

"Come on," spoke Tom in a low tone to Ned, "I've seen enough."

The two chums moved toward Ned's house, followed by the jeers and
mocking laughter of Andy and his cronies.

"Can't you get back at them in some way?" asked Ned, for he did not
like to see himself or his friend apparently vanquished by the
bully.

"He laughs best who laughs last, Ned."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean that when Andy tries to fly in his triplane it will be our
turn to laugh."

"Won't it fly?"

"Never, the way he has it rigged up. It didn't take but one look to
tell me that. He's working on altogether the wrong principle. Wait
until he tries to go up, and then we'll have some fun with him."

"Then you got a good view of it through the window?"

"I saw all I wanted to. But say, I was about to take a little trip
in my monoplane, to see my friend Mr. Damon, when Abe's letter
arrived, and you came along with your news. I started to take
Eradicate, but he backed out. Don't you want to come?"

"Sure, I'll go along."

Ned had often ridden in the trim Butterfly, though the trips had not
been so frequent that he was tired of them. A little later, Tom,
having adjusted the motor that had stalled before, compelling him to
vol-plane back to earth, the two chums were sailing through the air
toward Waterford.

"Why, bless my shoe laces!" cried Mr. Damon, as they alighted in the
yard of his house, about an hour later. "I didn't expect you, Tom.
But I'm glad to see you!"

"And I to meet you again. I guess you know Ned Newton."

"Ah, yes. How d'ye do, Ned? Bless my appetite! but it's quite
chilly. We'll soon have winter. Won't you come in and have some hot
chocolate?"

The boys were glad to accept the invitation, and as they were
drinking the beverage, which Mrs. Damon made for them, Tom told of
the receipt of the letter from the old miner, and also his
experience in seeing Andy's airship.

"Why, bless my pocketbook!" cried Mr. Damon. "I had no idea we'd
ever hear from Abe Abercrombie again. And so he is really coming on,
to tell us about the valley of gold?"

"So he says," replied Tom. "I was wondering if you'd like to go, Mr.
Damon."

"Go? Why, bless my very topknot! Of course I would. I'll go with
you--only--only," and he leaned forward and whispered cautiously,
"don't speak so loudly. My wife might hear you!"

"Doesn't she want you to go off in the airship any more?" asked Tom.

"Well, she'd rather I wouldn't. But she's going on a visit to her
mother, soon, and then I think will come my opportunity to take
another trip with you. A valley of gold in Alaska, eh? Up where the
icebergs and caves of ice are. Say, Tom, I know some one else who
would be glad to go."

"Who?" inquired the young inventor, though he had an idea to whom
his friend referred.

"Mr. Parker! You know he's taken up his residence in Waterford, now,
and only the other day he spoke to me about wishing he could go to
the far north. He has some new theory--"

"About the destruction of something or other; hasn't he, Mr. Damon?"
interrupted Tom, with a smile.

"That's it, exactly, my boy. Bless my coffeepot! But Mr. Parker has
an idea that the whole northern part of this continent will soon be
buried thousands of feet deep under an icy avalanche, and he wants
to be there to see it. I know he'd like to go with us, Tom."

The young inventor made a little gesture of dissent, but as he knew
Mr. Damon, who was very eccentric himself, had taken a great liking
to the gloomy scientist, Tom did not feel like refusing. So he said:

"All right, Mr. Damon. If we go, and I think we shall, we'll expect
you and Mr. Parker. I'll let you know the result of Mr.
Abercrombie's visit, and I needn't request you to keep quiet about
it. If there is a valley of gold in Alaska, we don't want everyone
to know about it."

"No, of course not, Tom Swift. I'll keep silent about it. Bless my
liverpin! But I'll be glad to be on the move again, even if it is
toward the Arctic regions."

After some further talk, Tom and Ned took their departure, making
good time back to Shopton in the speedy monoplane.

For several days after that Tom busied himself about his big airship
the RED CLOUD, for it needed quite a few repairs after the long trip
to the mountains where the diamond makers had been discovered in
their cave.

"And if we're going up amid the ice and snow," reasoned Tom, "I've
got to make some different arrangements about the craft, and provide
for keeping warmer than we found necessary when we went west."

So it was that Tom had no time to learn anything further about Andy
Foger's airship, even had our hero been so inclined, which he was
not. He looked for Abe Abercrombie any day now, for though the old
miner had given no date as to when he would arrive, he had said, in
his letter, that it would be soon.

It was one day, nearly a week after Tom's attempt to make Eradicate
like aeroplaning, that there might have been seen, coming along the
Shopton road, which led toward Tom's house, the figure of a grizzled
old man. His clothes were rather rough, and he carried a valise that
had, evidently, seen much service. There was that about him which
proclaimed him for a westerner--a cattleman or a miner.

He walked slowly along, murmuring to himself.

"Wa'al, I might better have taken one of them wagons at th' depot,"
he said, "than t' try t' walk. It's quite a stretch out t' Tom
Swift's house. I hope I find him home."

He trudged on, and, a little later, his gaze was attracted by a
large shed, in the rear of a white house the pretentious appearance
of which indicated that persons of wealth owned it.

"I guess that must be the place," he remarked. "That shed is big
enough to hold the airship. Now to present myself."

As he walked up the front path of the house, he was met by one of
the gardeners, who was raking up the leaves.

"Is this the airship place?" asked the miner.

"Yes, that's where the young master is making his triplane,"
answered the man.

"Is he in?"

"Yes, I guess so. You can walk right back to the shed."

The miner did so. Through the open door of the building he had a
glimpse of big stretches of wings, propellers, rudders, and some
machinery.

"That's it," he murmured, "though it looks some different than I
remembered it. However, maybe Tom's changed it about. I wonder where
he is?"

As he spoke a lad came from the shed to meet him--a lad on whose
face there was a look of suspicion.

"What do you want?" he demanded.

"I'm lookin' for Tom Swift," was the simple reply. "But I take it
you're one of his partners in this airship business. I guess he must
have told you about me. I'm Abe Abercrombie, the miner, and I've
come to show him the way to that valley of gold in Alaska."

At the mention of Tom Swift's name, Andy Foger, for it was he, had
started to utter a denial. But, at the next words of the miner, and
as Mr. Abercrombie mentioned "gold" and "Alaska," there came a
cunning look over Andy's face.

"Tom Swift isn't here just now," he said, wondering how he could
turn to advantage the unexpected visit, and the impending
information that the guileless old man was about to give under the
mistaken idea that Andy was Tom's friend.

"That's all right, I reckon he'll be along presently. You'll do just
as well, I reckon. You're in partnership with him, I take it. So
this is the place where he makes his airships, eh? It's a big one,"
and Mr. Abercrombie looked in at the odd triplane of Andy's--for the
airship was almost finished.

"But it'll need to be big if we're to go to Alaska in it," went on
the miner. "It's quite a journey t' th' valley where th' gold is. No
way t' get t' it except by an airship. An' here I be an' ready to
start, I've brought th' map of th' place, jest as I promised. Here
it is, better take good care of it. Now, let's talk business," and
the miner, having guilelessly handed Andy Foger a folded parchment,
sat down on a box at the door of the airship shed, and placed his
heavy valise on the ground beside him.

"What's this?" asked the bully, wondering whether he had heard
aright.

"It's the map of th' valley of gold--directions how t' git there,
an' all that. I guess it's plain enough. Now, when can we start?"

Andy did not know what to say. Fate had, most unexpectedly, placed
in his hands a valuable paper. The miner had made a mistake. Andy's
house was on the same road as was Tom's and, seeing the airship
shed, had deceived the aged man. He had not expected to find two
airship manufactories in the same village.

"The map of the valley of gold," murmured Andy, as he put it in his
pocket.

"Yes, jest as I told Tom about when I met him out West. I said I'd
bring it with me, an' I did. When will Tom be back? He never spoke
of you, though I reckoned he'd have to have some help in makin' his
airships. Where is he?"

"He--he--" stammered Andy. He did not know what to say.

At that instant Tom Swift himself passed by in the road. He had been
over to Shopton on an errand. One look into the yard of Andy's house
showed to our hero the old miner sitting at the door of the airship
shed.

"Mr. Abercrombie--Abe!" cried Tom, almost, before he thought.

"Hello, Tom! I got here!" cried the miner, heartily. "I was jest
talking to your partner."

"My partner!" spoke Tom in amazement.

"Yes--partner in th' airship business. I should think you'd need
about three partners to build these machines!"

"My partner! Andy Foger isn't my partner!" cried Tom, wondering what
would happen next. "I have no partner! If he said he was he deceived
you!"

"No partner? Ain't he your partner?" cried Mr. Abercrombie. "Why, I
thought he was. I told him about th' valley of gold--I--I--give him
the map--"

"The map?"

"Yes, the map t' tell how to get there. He's got it!"

There was a mocking smile on Andy's face.

"Give that map back at once!" cried Tom, sternly, now understanding
something of the situation. "Hand it over at once, Andy Foger!"

"I will--when I get ready! He gave it to me!" cried the bully, and
then, before either Tom or Abe could stop him, Andy darted into the
big shed, and slammed shut the door.




CHAPTER IV

TOM GETS THE MAP


For a few seconds Tom was so surprised at the sudden action of the
bully that he could neither move nor speak. Then, crying out a
command to halt, the young inventor took after his enemy.

"The scamp!" he cried. "The nerve he has! To deceive Abe Abercrombie
in that fashion! Wait until I get hold of him!"

"What's it all about?" asked the old miner, who, being a slow
thinker had not understood all that had happened. "What's up, Tom
Swift?"

"Haven't time to tell you now," flung back the running lad over his
shoulder. "I've got to catch Andy! Then I'll explain. He's trying to
get ahead of us, I guess, but we'll stop him!" Thereupon Tom flung
himself against the door of the airship shed. The young inventor
found the portal bolted, though it vibrated with the impact of his
body.

"Come out of there, Andy Foger!" cried Tom, pounding on the door.
"Come out, or I'll get an officer, and have you arrested!"

There was no answer.

"Come out, I say!" repeated Tom.

"Around th' back! Try th' back door!" suggested the miner, who had
hastened to Tom's side. "Maybe he's run out that way!"

Tom listened. There was no movement in the shop. Then the young
inventor sprinted around the side. He was just in time to see the
bully running away over the lots and fields in the rear of his
father's premises. Andy had climbed out of the back window of the
shed, into which Tom and Ned had peered that day, had climbed the
high fence, dropped down on the other side, and was now running away
with all the speed he could muster.

"Come back--!" began Tom, and then he realized that his enemy could
not hear him. The bully was too far away. At the same time our hero
realized that it would be useless to give chase, for Andy had too
much of a start. There was nothing to do but to turn back, and Tom
knew that his delay in trying to gain an entrance at the front door
had given Andy the very opportunity he needed to escape at the rear.

"Well, this is a bad turn of affairs," remarked the lad, as he faced
the puzzled miner.

"What is, Tom?"

"Him having that map. It shows the location of the valley of gold,
doesn't it, and tells how to get there?"

"That's what it does!"

"How did Andy happen to get it?"

"Jest as I told you. I was on my way t' your house, havin' inquired
at th' post-office, an' the man said that at your place there was a
big shed, where you kept your airships. I come along, an', of
course, when I see this house, an' the shed, an' had a glimpse of
th' airship, I, of course, thought it was your place. An', though
you'd never told me about it, I thought maybe this lad was in
business with you. So, like a blamed young tenderfoot, I blurted out
my business afore I thought, an' handed him the map for safe
keepin'. He took it, too, that's the worst of it."

"Yes, that's the worst of it," agreed Tom, "But I'll get it back, if
I have to cause his arrest, and search his whole house."

"But he runned away, Tom."

"Oh, he'll come back. Was there only one copy of the map of the
valley, Abe?" asked Tom, anxiously.

"Yep; only one."

"Could you make another?"

"No, not if you was to pay me a million dollars! You see I ain't no
drawer, an' this map, while I made part of it, was mostly made by my
old partner, who was with me when we discovered th' valley of gold,
an' was druv back by th' savage Eskimos an' Indians, an' by th'
terrible cold. My partner made th' best part of th' map, an' he's
dead, poor fellow."

"I see. That's too bad! Then you can't make a duplicate map?"

"Nary a one. But can't you do somethin'? It were amazin' stupid of
me, old Abe Abercrombie, t' be took in by a boy like him! Can't you
do somethin'?"

"I'm going to try," announced Tom determinedly, as he swung on
toward the Foger house. "I'll cause his arrest if he doesn't give it
up."

A few minutes later Tom Swift and Abe confronted Mr. Foger. The rich
man, father of the bully, was rather surprised at the visit from the
young inventor, for the two were not friends.

"Well, what can I do for you, Tom Swift?" asked the banker, for he
felt a certain coldness toward our hero, since the latter had
defeated him in an effort to wreck a financial institution in which
Tom and his father were interested.

"Mr. Foger," spoke Tom, sternly, "your son has just stolen a map
belonging to this gentleman," and he indicated Abe.

"My son stolen a map!" exclaimed Mr. Foger. "How dare you make such
an accusation, Tom Swift?"

"I dare, because it's true! And, unless that map is returned to me
at my house to-night I shall swear out a warrant for Andy's arrest."

"You'd never dare do that!"

"Wait and see!" spoke Tom, firmly. "I will give your son, or you,
exactly five hours to return that map--if it isn't back in my hands
by then, I'll get a warrant!"

"Preposterous! Stuff and nonsense!" blustered Mr. Foger. "My son
never stole anything!"

"He stole this map, and there is plenty of evidence," went on Tom,
as he detailed the circumstances.

Mr. Foger hemmed and hawed, and affected not to believe that
anything of the kind could have happened. But Tom was firm, and Abe
Abercrombie backed up his statements, until even the banker began to
waver.

"Very well," he announced at length, "I will look into this matter,
and if I find that my son has anything of yours, you shall have it
back. But I cannot believe it. Perhaps he took it as a joke."

"In which case," spoke Tom grimly, "he will find that he has carried
the joke too far," and with that he and the miner left the Foger
home.

"It's all my fault," bewailed Abe, as he and our hero trudged on
toward the Swift household.

"No, it wasn't, Abe," declared Tom. "Any one would have been
deceived by such tactics as Andy used--that is any stranger. And you
didn't expect to find two airship sheds so close together."

"No. That's right, I didn't. That's what threw me off th' track."

"Andy only recently began work on his triplane. I don't know what
his object is, and I don't care. Just now I'm more concerned about
getting back this map."

"I hope we do get it."

"Oh, we will. I'm going to start off on my own hook, to find Andy.
But first I'll take you to my house."

The old miner was soon telling his story to Mr. Swift, the
housekeeper and Garret Jackson. They expressed their surprise at
Andy's daring act. But Tom didn't do much more talking.

"I'm going out to find Andy," he declared, "and when I do--" He
didn't finish his sentence, but they all knew what he meant.

But the bully was in none of his usual haunts, though Tom visited
them all. Nor was Andy at the homes of either of his cronies.

"Well, if I don't find him, I shall certainly swear out the
warrant," decided Tom. "I'll give him until night, and then I'll
call on the police."

Still he did not give up, but went to several other places where
Andy might be found. He had about given up, as it was getting toward
late afternoon, when, as he came out of a billiardroom, where the
bully was in the habit of spending much of his time, Tom saw the lad
of whom he was in search.

"Hold on there, Andy Foger!" cried the young inventor. "I want to
see you!"

"What about?"

"You know very well. Where's that map you stole?"

"I haven't got it."

"Take care!" and Tom, with a quick step was beside the bully, and
had grasped him firmly by the arm.

"You let me alone, Tom Swift!" cried Andy.

"Where's that map?" and Tom gave Andy's arm a wrench.

"It's at your house; that's where it is! I just took it back. It was
only a joke."

"A joke, eh? And you took it back?"

"Yes, I did. Now you let me go!"

"I will when I find out if you're telling me the truth or not, Andy
Foger. You come with me!"

"Where?"

"To my house. I want to see if that map's there."

"Well, you'll find that it is, and you'd better let me go! My father
told me to take the map back, and I did. You let me go!"

Andy struggled to get loose, but Tom had too tight a grip. There was
something, too, in the manner of our hero that warned Andy not to
trifle with him. So, concluding that discretion was the better part
of valor, Andy walked sullenly along toward Tom's home, the young
inventor never relaxing the grip on his enemy's arm.

They reached the Swift home. Still holding his captive, Tom rang the
bell. His father came to the door, followed by Abe Abercrombie.

"Is the map back?" asked the young inventor, anxiously.

"Yes, Andy brought it here a few minutes ago," announced Mr. Swift.

"Is it the right one, Abe?" inquired Tom.

"Yep, Tom. I made sure of that as soon as I laid my eyes on it. It's
th' right one."

"Then you can go, Andy Foger," announced our hero, "and if I ever
catch you in another trick like this, I'll take the law into my own
hands. Clear out, now!"

"You wait! I'll get even with you," muttered the bully, as he fled
down the front walk, as though afraid Tom would, even then, put his
threat into execution.

"Did he damage the map any?" asked the lad, as he followed his
father and Abe into the house.

"Nary a bit," answered the old miner. "It's jest th' same as it was.
There it is," and he spread a crinkled sheet of tough parchment in
front of Tom. It was covered with a rude drawing, and with names of
places scrawled on it.

"So that's the map, eh?" murmured Tom, eagerly scanning it.

"That's it, an' here's th' valley of gold," went on Abe, as he
placed one rough finger on a certain spot. "Right there--hello!" he
cried, as he peered more closely at the parchment. "That ink spot
wasn't there when I had th' map, a few hours ago."

"What ink spot?" asked Tom, anxiously.

"That one," and the miner indicated a small one near the edge of the
map. "That was never there!"

"It looks as if it was recently made," added Mr. Swift, who was
something of a chemist.

"An ink spot-freshly made," murmured Tom, "Dad--Abe, I can guess
what's happened!"

"What?" demanded the miner.

"Andy Foger made a copy of this map while it was in his possession,
and now he knows where the valley of gold is as well as we do! He
may get there ahead of us!"




CHAPTER V

GRAVE SUSPICIONS


Tom's announcement took them all by surprise. For a moment no one
knew what to say, while the young inventor looked more closely at
the parchment map.

"Do you really think he has dared to make a copy of it?" asked Mr.
Swift.

"I do," answered his son. "That ink spot wasn't there when Abe gave
him the map; was it?"

"No," replied the miner.

"And it couldn't get on in Andy's pocket," went on Tom. "So he must
have had it open near where there was ink."

"His fountain pen might have leaked," suggested Mr. Jackson.

"In that case the ink spot would be on the outside of the map, and
not on the inside," declared Tom, with the instinct of a detective.
"Unless he had the map folded in his pocket with the inside surface
on the outside, the ink couldn't have gotten on. Besides, Andy
always carries his fountain pen in his upper vest pocket, and that
pocket is too small to hold the map. No, I'm almost positive that
Andy or his father have sneakingly made a copy of this map!"

"I'm sorry to have to admit that Mr. Foger is capable of such an
act," spoke Mr. Swift, "but I believe it is true."

"And here is another thing," went on the young inventor, who was now
closely scanning the parchment through a powerful magnifying glass,
"do you see those tiny holes here and there, Mr. Jackson?"

"Yes," answered the engineer.

"Were they there before, Abe?" went on Tom, calling the old miner's
attention to them.

"Nary a one," was the answer. "It looks as if some one had been
sticking pins in th' map."

"Not pins," said Tom, "but the sharp points of a pair of dividers,
or compasses, for measuring distances. Andy, or whoever made a copy
of the map, used the dividers to take off distances with. This
clinches it, in my mind."

"But what can you do?" asked Tom's father.

"I don't know," answered the young inventor. "It would be of little
use to go to Andy. Naturally he would deny having made a copy of the
map, and his father would, also. Even though I am sure they have a
copy, I don't see how I am going to make them give it up. It's a
hard case. There's only one thing I see to do."

"What's that?" asked Abe.

"Start for Alaska as soon as possible, and be first on hand at the
valley of gold."

"Good!" cried the miner. "That's the way to talk! We'll start off at
once. I know my way around that country pretty well, an' even though
winter is coming on, I think we can travel in th' airship. That's
one reason why I wanted t' go in one of these flyin' machines.
Winter is no time to be in Alaska, but if we have an airship we
won't mind it, an' it's the best time t' keep other people away, for
th' ordinary miner or prospector can't do anythin' in Alaska in
winter--that is away up north where we're goin'."

"Exactly where are we going?" asked Tom. "I have been so excited
about discovering Andy's trick that I haven't had much time to
consider where we're bound for nor what will be the best plan to
follow."

"Well, we're goin' to a region about seven hundred an' fifty miles
northwest from Sitka," explained the old miner, as he pointed out
the location on the map. "We'll head for what they call th' Snow
Mountains, an' th' valley of gold is in their midst. It's just over
th' Arctic circle, an' pretty cold, let me tell you!"

"You'll be warm enough in Tom's airship, with the electric stoves
going," commented Mr. Jackson.

"Well, we'll need t' be," went on the miner. "Th' valley is full of
caves of ice, an' it's dangerous for th' ordinary traveler. In fact
an airship was the only way I saw out of th' difficulty when I was
there."

"Then you have been to the valley of gold?" asked Tom.

"Well, not exactly TO it," was the reply, "but I was where I could
see it. That was in th' summer, though of course the summer there
isn't like here. I'll tell you how it was."

The miner settled himself more comfortably in his chair, and resumed
his story.

"It was two year ago," he said, "that me an' Jim Mace started to
prospect in Alaska. We didn't have much luck, an' we kept on workin'
our way farther north until we come to these Snow Mountains. Then
our supplies gave out, an' if it hadn't been for some friendly
Eskimos I don't know what we would have done. Jim and me we gave 'em
some trinkets an' sich, and th' Indians began talkin' of a wonderful
valley of gold, where th' stuff lay around in chunks on top of the
ground."

"Me and Jim pricked up our ears at that, so to speak, an' we wanted
to see th' place. After some delay we was taken to th' top of a big
crag, some distance away from where we had been stopping with the
friendly Eskimos, or Indians, as I call 'em. There, away down below,
was a valley--an' a curious sort of a valley it were. It seemed
filled with big bubbles--bubbles made of solid banks of snow or ice,
an' we was told, me an' Jim was, that these were caves of ice, an'
that th' gold was near these caves."

"Well, of course me an' my partner wanted to go down the worst way,
an' try for some gold, but th' Indians wouldn't let us. They said it
was dangerous, for th' ice caves were constantly fallin' in, an'
smashin' whoever was inside. But to prove what they said about th'
gold, they sent one of their number down, while we waited on th'
side of th' mountain."

"Did he get any gold?" asked Tom, eagerly.

For answer the old miner pulled from his pocket a few yellow
pebbles--little stones of dull, gleaming yellow.

"There's some of th' gold from amid th' caves of ice," he remarked
simply. "I kept 'em for a souvenir, hopin' some day I might git back
there. Well, Jim an' me watched th' Indian going down into th'
valley. He come back in about three hours, havin' only gone to th'
nearest cave, an' he had two pockets filled with these little chunks
of solid gold. They gave me an' Jim some, but they wouldn't hear of
us goin' t' th' valley by ourselves."

"Then a bad storm come up, an' we had t' hit th' trail for home--the
Indians' home, I mean--for Jim an' I was far enough away from ours."

"Well, t' make a long story short, Jim an' me tried every way we
knowed t' git t' that valley, but we couldn't. It come off colder
an' colder, an' th' tribe of Indians with whom we lived was attacked
by some of their enemies, an' driven away from their campin'
grounds. Jim an' me, we went too, but not before Jim had drawed this
map on a piece of dog-skin we found in one of the huts. We had an
idea we might get back, some day, an' find the valley, so we'd need
a map t' go by. But poor Jim never got back. He got badly frozen
when the Indians drove us an' our friends away, an' he never got
over it. He died up there in th' ice, an' we buried him. I took th'
map, an' when spring come, I made a hike out of that country. From
then until now I've been plannin' how t' git t' that valley, an' th'
only way I seen was an airship. Then, when I was prospectin' around
out in Colorado I saw Tom's machine hidden in th' trees, an' I
waited until he come along, which part you know as well as I do,"
finished Abe.

"And that's the story of the valley of gold," spoke Mr. Swift.

"That's all there is to it," assented Abe, simply.

"Do you think there is much gold there?" asked Tom.

"Plenty of it--for th' pickin' up," replied the miner. "Around th'
caves of ice it's full of it, but, of course, it's dangerous. An'
th' only way t' git t' it, an' pass th' savage Indians that are all
around in th' mountains about th' valley, is t' fly over their heads
in th' airship."

"Then that's what we'll do," decided Tom.

"Will you go all the way in the RED CLOUD?" inquired Mr. Jackson.

"No, I think I'll send the airship on ahead to some point in
Washington--say Seattle," replied Tom, "put it together there, and
start for the Snow Mountains. In Seattle we can get plenty of
supplies and stores. It will be a good point to start from, and will
save us a long, and perhaps dangerous, flight across the United
States."

"I think that will be the best plan," agreed Mr. Swift. "But what
about Andy--do you think he'll try to follow--or try to get ahead of
you now that he has a copy of the map?"

"He may," answered Tom. "But I have a little trick I'm going to work
on Andy. I will try to learn whether he really has a copy of the
map, though I'm practically certain of it. Then I'll decide what's
best to do."

"In th' meanwhile, will you be gettin' ready?" asked Abe. "I'd like
t' start as soon as we can, for it's awful cold there, the longer
you wait, at this time of th' year."

"Yes, I'll start right to work, getting the RED CLOUD in readiness
to be shipped," promised Tom.




CHAPTER VI

ANDY'S AIRSHIP FLIES


"Hello, Tom, have you heard the news?" asked Ned Newton, of the
young inventor, a few days later.

"What news, Ned? I declare I've been so busy thinking out the best
plan to ship the RED CLOUD to Seattle that I haven't been over to
town. What's going on? Have they decided to build a new church in
Shopton, or something like that?"

"Oh, this about Andy Foger's airship."

"Andy's airship, eh? Is he still working on it?"

"It's all done, so Sam Snedecker was telling me last night, and
to-day Andy is going to try to fly it."

"You don't mean it!"

"Sure thing. Let's go over and watch him."

"He might make a fuss, same as he did when we looked in the window
of his shed."

"He can't make any fuss now. He's got to take his machine out to fly
it, and anybody that wants to can look on. Didn't he watch you make
flights often enough?"

"That's so. Where is the trial flight going to take place?"

"In the big meadow. Come on over."

"Guess I will. I can't do much more now. I've been getting some
boxes and crates made in which to pack the RED CLOUD. I'll have to
take her all apart."

"Then you're really going to hunt for the valley of gold?"

"Sure thing. How about you going, Ned? I spoke to dad about it, and
he said he'd see that you could have a leave of absence."

"Yes, that part's all right. The bank president told me today I
could take a vacation any time I wanted it. In fact that's what I
came over to see you about. I want to thank your father."

"Then you're going?"

"I sure am, Tom! Won't it be great! I hope I can get a little gold
for myself! My folks didn't take very much to the notion of me going
off in an airship, but I told them how often you'd gone on trips,
and come safely back, so they finally gave their consent. When are
you going to start?"

"Oh, in about two weeks. Did I tell you about Andy and the map?"

"No. What trick has he been up to now?"

Thereupon Tom related his suspicions concerning the bully, and also
hinted to Ned of a certain ruse he intended to work on Andy when he
got the chance.

"Well, if you're ready, suppose we go over and see if Andy's airship
will really fly," suggested Ned, after a while. "I'm doubtful
myself, and I'd just like to see him come to grief, after the many
mean things he's done to you."

"Well," spoke Tom slowly, "I don't know as I wish him any bad luck,
but I certainly hope he doesn't use his airship to try to beat us
out in the hunt for the valley of gold."

"Do you think he might?"

"It's possible. But never mind about that now. Come on, we'll go
over to the big meadow."

The two chums walked along together, talking of many things. Tom
told of some communication he had had with Mr. Damon, in which
letters the eccentric man had inquired as to when the trip for
Alaska would be undertaken.

"Then he's going?" asked Ned.

"Oh, yes, it wouldn't seem natural to go without some of Mr. Damon's
blessings. But I think he's going to bring a friend with him."

"Who?"

"Mr. Ralph Parker."

"That gloomy scientist, who is always predicting such terrible
things going to happen?"

"That's the gentleman. You met him once, I believe. Mr. Damon says
Mr. Parker wants to do some scientific studying in the far north, so
I've already counted on him as one of our party. Well, perhaps he
won't do so much predicting this trip."

A little later Tom and Ned came to a big open field. They saw quite
a crowd gathered in it, but no sign of an airship.

"Guess Andy hasn't arrived," spoke Tom.

"No; very likely he's found out that something is wrong with his
machine, and he isn't going to risk it."

But almost as Ned spoke, there sounded cries of excitement from the
crowd, and, a little later, something big and white, with many
wing-shaped stretches of canvas sticking out from all sides, was seen
turning into the big meadow from the broad highway that led to
Andy's house.

"There she is!" cried Ned.

"There's something, at any rate," conceded Tom, as he hastened his
steps. "It's a queer-looking aeroplane, though. My! he's got enough
wings to it!"

"Yes, it's Andy's sure enough," went on Ned "There he is in front,
giving orders like a major-general, and Sam and Pete are helping
him. Let's get closer."

They followed the crowd, which was thronging about the airship that
Andy Foger had made, Tom had a glimpse of the machine. It was a form
of triplane, with three tiers of main wings, and several other sets
of planes, some stationary and some capable of being moved. There
was no gas-bag feature, but amidships was a small, enclosed cabin,
which evidently held the machinery, and was designed to afford
living quarters. In some respects the airship was not unlike Tom's,
and the young inventor could see that Andy had copied some of his
ideas. But Tom cared little about this.

"Do you think it will go up?" asked Ned.

"It looks to me to be too heavy, and his propellers seem too small,"
answered Tom. "He's got to have a very powerful motor to make all
that bulk fly."

The people were crowding in closer around the airship, for the news
that Andy was to attempt a flight had spread about town.

"Now keep back--all of you!" ordered the bully, with a show of
anger. "If any one damages my airship I'll have him arrested! Keep
back, now, or I won't fly!"

"Reminds me of a little kid saying he won't play if he can't have
his own way," whispered Ned to Tom.

"Hello, Andy, give us a ride!"

"Going above the clouds?"

"When are you coming back?"

"Bring down a snowstorm!"

"Be careful that you don't fall!"

These were some of the things shouted at Andy, for he had few
friends among the town lads, on account of his mean ways.

"Keep quiet--all of you!" he ordered. "Get back. You might get hurt
when I start the motor. I'm going to make a flight soon," he added
proudly. "Sam, you come over here and hold this end. Pete, you go
back to the rear. Simpson, you get inside and help me with the
motor. Henderson, you get ready to shove when I tell you."

These last orders were to the two machinists whom Andy had engaged
to help him, and the bully gave himself no end of airs and
importance as he bustled about.

Tom could not help but admit that Andy's machine was a big affair.
There was a great stretch of wings and planes, several rudders other
appliances for which the young inventor could not exactly fathom a
use. He did not think the machine would fly far, if at all. But Andy
was hurrying here and there, getting the triplane in place on a
level stretch of ground, as if he intended to capture some great
prize.

"Are you going to tackle him about stealing a copy of that map?"
asked Ned.

"I will if I get a chance," answered Tom, in a low voice.

He got his opportunity a few minutes later. Andy, hurrying here and
there, came face to face with the young inventor.

"Hello, Andy," spoke Tom, good-naturedly. "So you're going to make a
flight, eh?"

"Yes, I am, and I s'pose you came around to see if you could get any
ideas; didn't you?" sneered Andy.

"Of course," admitted Tom, with an easy laugh. "My airship doesn't
fly, you know, Andy, and I want to see what's wrong with it."

There was a laugh in the crowd, at this, for Tom's success was well
known.

"Are you going to Alaska?" suddenly asked Tom, in a low voice, of
the bully.

"To Alaska? I--I don't--I don't know what you mean?" stammered Andy,
as he turned aside.

"Yes, you do know what I mean," insisted Tom. "And I want to tell
you that the map you have won't be of much use to you. Why, do you
think," he went on, "that Abe would carry the real map around with
him that way? It's easy to make a copy look like an original, Andy,
and also very easy to put false distances and directions on a map
that may fall into the hands of an enemy."

The shot told. Andy's face turned first red and then pale.

"A--a false map!" he stammered. "Wrong directions?"

"Yes--on the copy you made of the map you took from Mr.
Abercrombie," went on Tom.

"I--I didn't make any--Oh, I'm not going to talk to you!" blustered
Andy. "Get out of my way! I'm going to fly my airship."

The bully pushed past Tom, and started toward the triplane. But Tom
had found out what he wanted to know. Andy had made a copy of the
map. From now on there would be every danger that the bully would
make an effort to get to the valley of gold.

But other matters held Andy's attention now. He wanted to try his
airship. With the help of his two cronies, and the machinists, the
machine was gone over, oiled up, and finally, after several false
starts, the motor was set going.

It made a terrific racket, and the whole machine vibrated as though
it would shake apart.

"He hasn't got it well enough braced," said Tom to Ned.

"Out of the way, now, everybody!" yelled Andy. "Keep away or you'll
get hurt! I'm going up!"

He climbed into the cabin of the craft, and took his position at the
steering-wheel. The speed of the motor, its racket and its stream of
sparks increased.

"Let go!" cried Andy to those who were holding his craft.

They released their hold. The triplane moved slowly across the
ground, gathered speed, and, then, under the impulse of the powerful
propellers, ran rapidly over the meadow.

"Hurrah! There he goes!" cried Sam.

"Yes! Now he's going to fly," proudly added Pete Bailey, the other
crony of the bully.

"He'd better fly soon, then, or he'll be in the ditch," said Tom
grimly, for a little, sluggish stream crossed the meadow not far
from where Andy had started.

The next instant, thinking he had momentum enough, Andy tilted his
elevation plane. The clumsy triplane rose into the air and shot
forward.

"There he goes!" cried Sam.

"Hurrah!" yelled the crowd.

Andy had gone up about ten feet, and was making slow progress.

"I guess Tom Swift isn't the only one in Shopton who can build an
airship!" sneered Pete Bailey.

"Look! Look!" yelled Ned. "He's coming down!"

Sure enough, Andy's machine had reached the end of her flight. The
motor stopped with something between a cough and a wheeze. Down
fluttered the aeroplane, like some clumsy bird, down into the ditch,
settling on one side, and then coming to rest, tilted over at a
sharp angle. Andy was pitched out, but landed on the soft mud, for
there had been a thaw. He wasn't hurt much, evidently, for he soon
scrambled to his feet as the crowd surged toward him.

"Well, he flew a little way," observed Ned, grimly.

"But he came down mighty soon," added Tom. "I thought he would. His
machine is too big and clumsy. I've seen enough. Come on, Ned. We'll
get ready to go to Alaska. Andy Foger will never follow us in that
machine."

But Tom was soon to find out how much mistaken he was.




CHAPTER VII

READY FOR THE TRIP


Andy Foger stood looking at his tilted airship. His clothes were
covered with mud from the ditch, some of the muck had splashed over
his face so that he was a pitiable looking object.

"What's the matter?" panted Pete Bailey.

"Are you hurt?" asked Sam Snedecker.

The two cronies had hurried to the side of the bully.

"Matter? Can't you see what's the matter?" demanded Andy wrathfully.
"The machine came down, that's what's the matter! Why didn't you
fellows fix the motor better?" he shouted at the two machinists as
they came running up, followed by the crowd.

"Fix it better? The motor was all right," declared the taller
machinist. "Any of them are likely to stop unexpectedly."

"Well, I didn't think mine would," came from Andy. "Now look at my
airship! It's all busted!"

"No, it isn't hurt much," said the other man, after critically
looking it over. "We can fix it, and you'll fly yet, Andy."

"I hope I do, if only to fool Tom Swift," declared the bully, as he
wiped some of the mud from his face. "Come on, now, help me wheel
the machine back, and I'll try it again."

Andy made another attempt, but this time the machine did not even
rise off the ground, and then, amid the jeers of the crowd, the
discomfited lad took his aeroplane back to the shed in the rear of
his house.

"I'll fix it yet, and make a long flight," he declared. "I'll show
Tom Swift he can't laugh at me!"

"You'll make a long flight eh?" asked one of the machinists. "Where
will you go?"

"Never mind," answered Andy, with a knowing wink. "I've got a plan
up my sleeve--my father and I are going to do something that will
astonish everybody in Shopton," and then Andy, with many nods and
winks, went into the shed, where he began giving orders about the
airship. He wanted the motor changed, and one of the machinists made
some suggestions about the planes, which, he said, would give better
results.

As for Tom and Ned, they strolled away, satisfied that in Andy Foger
they would not have a very dangerous rival, as far as airships were
concerned.

Tom thought matters over during the next few days. He was now
satisfied that Andy had a copy of the map, and, as far as he could
see, there was no way of getting it from him, for he could not prove
to the satisfaction of the legal authorities that the bully actually
had it.

"We'll just have to take a chance, that's all," decided the young
inventor in talking matters over with his father, Ned, and Abe
Abercrombie. "If Andy and some of his crowd trail after us, we'll
just have to run away from them and get to the valley first."

"If they do get there, they won't find it very easy traveling I
reckon," remarked Abe. "They'll get all they want of the caves of
ice. But hadn't we better get a hustle on ourselves, Tom?"

"Yes, we will soon start now. I have the RED CLOUD all packed up for
shipment to Seattle. We will send it on ahead, and then follow, for
it will take some time to get there, even though it's going by fast
freight."

"What about Mr. Damon?" asked Ned. "When is he coming?"

"There's no telling," responded Tom. "He may be on hand any minute,
and, again, he may only show up just as we are starting. I haven't
heard from him in the last day or two."

At that moment there was a knock on the private office in the
aeroplane shed, where Tom, Ned and Abe Abercrombie were talking.

"Who's there?" asked Tom.

"It's me," answered a voice recognizable as that of the colored man
Eradicate.

"What is it, Rad?" asked Tom.

"Why I jest thought I'd tell you dat de blessin' man am comin' down
de road."

"The blessing man?" repeated Tom. "Oh, you mean Mr. Damon."

"Yais, sah, dat's jest who I done mean. An' dere's anodder gen'man
wif him."

"Mr. Parker, I expect," spoke Tom. "Well, tell them to come in here,
Rad."

"Yais, sah. Dey's comin' up de path now, so dey is."

The next moment Tom and the others heard a voice saying:

"Why, bless my necktie! The RED CLOUD is gone!" Mr. Damon had peered
into the shed, and had not seen the airship, for Tom had it packed
up. "I wonder if Tom Swift has gone away? Bless my top-knot, Mr.
Parker, I hope we're not too late!"

"Indeed I hope not," added the scientist. "I wish to make a study of
the caves of ice. I think perhaps they may be working south, and, in
time, this part of the country may be covered deep under a frozen
blanket."

"Cheerful, isn't he, Ned?" asked Tom, with a smile. Then, going to
the door of the shed he called out: "Here we are, Mr. Damon. Glad to
see you, Mr. Parker." This last wasn't exactly true, but Tom wanted
to be polite.

"Bless my collar button, Tom! But what has become of the airship?"
asked Mr. Damon, as he looked about the shed, and saw only a number
of boxes and crates.

"Taken apart, and packed up, ready for the trip to the valley of
gold and the caves of ice," replied the young inventor, and then he
briefly told of their plans.

"Well, that's a good idea," declared the eccentric man. "Mr. Parker
and I are ready to go whenever you are, Tom."

"Then we'll start very soon. I will get all our supplies in Seattle.
Now, to discuss details," and, after Mr. Parker and Mr. Damon had
been made acquainted with the old miner, who told his story in
brief, they began a discussion of the prospective trip.

Mr. Damon and Mr. Parker took up their residence in Tom's house, and
while the eccentric man busied himself in helping our hero, Ned and
Abe Abercrombie in getting ready for the trip to Alaska, the gloomy
scientist went about making "observations" as he called them, with a
view to predicting what might happen in the near future.

He was particularly anxious to get up north, among the caves of ice,
and, several times he repeated his statement that he believed the
mass of ice in Alaska was working down toward the south. But no one
paid much attention to him, though Tom recalled, not without a
little shudder, that Mr. Parker had correctly predicted the
destruction of Earthquake Island, and also the landslide on Phantom
Mountain.

The airship was finally sent off, being forwarded to Seattle in
sections, where it could easily be put together. The matter of Andy
Foger having a duplicate map of the valley of gold was discussed,
but it was agreed that nothing could be done about it. So Tom and
the others devoted all their energies to getting in shape for their
prospective journey.

Mr. Swift was invited to go, but declined on the ground that he had
several inventions to perfect, nor could Mr. Jackson go, as he was
needed to help his employer. So Tom, Ned, Mr. Damon, Mr. Parker and
Abe Abercrombie made up the party. Tom arranged to send wireless
messages to his father from the airship once they were started off
toward the valley of gold, and over the frozen north.

One evening, when Tom had been to pay a last visit to Mary Nestor,
as he was coming past the Foger premises he saw a number of large
vans, loaded with big packing cases coming out of the banker's yard.

"Hum! I wonder if they're moving?" mused our hero. "If they are
they're taking a queer time for it." He paused a moment to look at
the procession of vans. As he did so he heard the voice of Andy
Foger.

"Now, I want you men to be careful of everything!" the bully called
out arrogantly. "If you break anything I'll sue you for damages!"

"Oh, that cub makes me sick!" exclaimed one of the drivers as he
came opposite Tom.

"What are you moving--eggs, that you have to be so careful?" asked
the young inventor, in a low voice.

"Eggs? No! But it might just as well be," was the growling answer.
"He's shipping an airship, all taken to pieces, and he has nervous
prostration for fear it will be broken. I don't believe the old
thing's any good, anyhow."

"An airship--Andy Foger sending away his airship?" gasped Tom.
"Where to?"

"Some place in Alaska," was the startling reply. "Pitka or Sitka, or
some such place like that. It's all in these boxes, G'lang there!"
this to his horses.

"Andy sending his airship to Alaska!" murmured Tom in dismay. "Then
he surely is going to make a try for that valley of gold!"

He turned away, while the snarling voice of the bully rang out on
the night, urging the drivers to be very careful of the boxes and
crates on their trucks.




CHAPTER VIII

A THIEF IN THE NIGHT


Tom Swift hardly knew what to think. He had scarcely believed, in
spite of the fact that he was sure Andy had a copy of the map, that
the bully would actually make an effort to go to the valley of gold.

"And in that airship of his, too," mused Tom. "Well, there's one
consolation, I don't believe he'll go far in that, though it does
sail better than when he made his first attempt. Well, if he's going
to try to beat us, it's a good thing I know it. We can be prepared
for him, now."

Tom, after watching the big vans for a few minutes, turned and kept
on toward his home.

There was more than surprise on the part of Mr. Damon and the others
when Tom told his news. There was alarm, for there was a feeling
that Mr. Foger and his son might adopt unscrupulous tricks.

"But what can we do?" asked Mr. Swift.

"Whitewash him!" exclaimed Eradicate Sampson, who had overheard part
of the conversation. "Dat's what I'd do t' him an' his father, too!
Dat's what I would! Fust I'd let mah mule Boomerang kick him a bit,
an' den, when he was all mussed up, I'd whitewash him!" That was the
colored man's favorite method of dealing with enemies, but, of
course, he could not always carry it out.

However, after considering the matter from all sides, it was decided
that nothing could be done for the present.

"Let them go," said Tom, "I don't believe they'll ever find the
valley of gold. I fancy I threw a scare into Andy, talking as I did
about the map."

"Well, even if the Fogers do get the gold," said Mr. Parker calmly,
"they cannot take away the caves of ice, and it is in them that I am
most interested. I want to prove some of my new theories."

"And we need the gold," said Tom, in a low voice; "don't we, Abe?"

"That's what we do, Tom," answered the old miner.

Preparations were now practically completed for their trip to
Seattle by rail. Tom made some inquiries in the next few days
regarding the Fogers, but only learned that the father and son had
left town, after superintending the shipment of their airship.

"Well, we start to-day," remarked Tom, as he arose one morning. "In
two weeks, at most, we ought to be hovering over the valley, Abe."

"I hope so, Tom. You've got the map put away safely, have you?"

"Sure thing. Are you all ready?"

"Yes."

"Then we'll start for the depot right after breakfast." The
adventurers had arranged to take a local train from Shopton, and get
on a fast express at one of the more important stations.

Good-byes were said, Mr. Swift, Mr. Jackson, Mrs. Baggert and
Eradicate waving their adieus from the porch as Tom and the others
started for the depot. Miss Mary Nestor had bidden our hero farewell
the previous night--it being a sort of second good-bye, for Tom was
a frequent caller at her house, and, if the truth must be told he
rather disliked to leave the young lady.

Tom found a few of his friends at the station, who had gathered
there to give him and Ned BON-VOYAGE.

"Bring us back some nuggets, Tom," pleaded Arthur Norton.

"Bring me a musk-ox if you can shoot one," suggested one.

"A live bear or a trained Eskimo for mine," exclaimed another.

Tom laughingly promised to do the best he could.

"I'll send you some gold nuggets by wireless," said Ned Newton.

It was almost time for the train to arrive. In the crowd on the
platform Tom noticed Pete Bailey.

"He must feel lost without Andy," observed the young inventor to
Ned.

"Yes, I wonder what he's hanging around here for?"

They learned a moment later, for they saw Pete going into the
telegraph office.

"Must be something important for him to wire about," observed Ned.

Tom did not answer. The window of the office was slightly open,
though the day was cool, and he was listening to the clicks of the
telegraph instrument, as the operator sent Pete's message. Tom was
familiar with the Morse code. What was his surprise to hear the
message being sent to Andy Foger at a certain hotel in Chicago. And
the message read:

"Tom Swift's party leaving to-day."

"What in the world does that mean?" thought Tom, but he did not tell
Ned what he had picked up as it went over the wire. "Why should Andy
want to be informed when we leave? That's why Pete was hanging
around here! He had been instructed to let Andy know when we left
for Seattle. There's something queer back of all this."

Tom was still puzzling over the matter when their train roiled in
and he and the others got aboard.

"Well, we're off!" cried Ned.

"Yes; we're off," admitted Tom, and, to himself he added: "No
telling what will happen before we get there, though."

The trip to Chicago was without incident, and, on arrival in the
Windy City, Tom was on the lookout for Andy or his father, but he
did not see them. He made private inquiries at the hotel mentioned
in Pete's telegram, but learned that the Fogers had gone on.

"Perhaps I'm worrying too much," thought Tom. But an event that
occurred a few nights later, when they were speeding across the
continent showed him that there was need of great precaution.

On leaving Chicago, Tom had noticed, among the other passengers
traveling in the same coach as themselves, a man who seemed to be
closely observing each member of the party of gold-hunters. He was a
man with a black mustache, a mustache so black, in fact, that Tom at
once concluded that it had been dyed. This, in itself, was not much,
but there was a certain air about the man--a "sporty" air--which
made Tom suspicious.

"I wouldn't be surprised if that man was a gambler, Ned," he said to
his chum, one afternoon, as they were speeding along. The man in
question was several seats away from Tom.

"He does look like one," agreed Ned.

"I needn't advise you not to fall in with any of his invitations to
play cards, I suppose," went on Tom, after a pause.

"No, indeed, it's something I don't do," answered Ned, with a laugh.
"But it might be a good thing to speak to Abe Abercrombie about him.
If that man's a sharper perhaps Abe knows him, or has seen him, for
Abe has traveled around in the West considerable."

"We'll ask him," agreed Tom, but the miner, when his attention was
called to the man, said he had never seen him before.

"He does look like a confidence man," agreed Abe, "but as long as he
doesn't approach us we can't do anything, and don't need to worry."

There was little need to call the attention of either Mr. Damon or
Mr. Parker to the man, for Mr. Damon was busy watching the scenery,
as this trip was a new one to him, and he was continually blessing
something he saw or thought of. As for Mr. Parker, he was puzzling
over some new theories he had in mind, and he said little to the
others.

On the night of the same day on which Tom had called special
attention to the man with the black mustache, our hero went to his
berth rather late. He had sent some telegrams to his father and one
to Miss Nestor, and, when he turned in he saw the "gambler," as he
had come to call him, going into the smoking compartment of the
coach. Though Tom thought of the man as a gambler, there was no
evidence, as yet, that he was one, and he had made no effort to
approach any of our friends, though he had observed them closely.

How long Tom had been asleep he did not know, but he was suddenly
awakened by feeling his pillow move. At first he thought it was
caused by the swaying of the train, and he was about to go to sleep
again, when there came a movement that he knew could not have been
caused by any unevenness of the roadbed.

Then, like a flash there came to Tom's mind the thought that under
his pillow, in a little leather case he had made for it, was the
map, showing the location of the valley of gold.

He sat up suddenly, and made a lunge for the pillow. He felt a hand
being hurriedly withdrawn. Tom made a grab for it, but the fingers
slipped from his grasp.

"Here! Who are you!" cried Tom, endeavoring to peer through the
darkness.

"It's all right--mistake," murmured a voice.

Tom leaned suddenly forward and parted the curtains of his berth.
There was a dim light burning in the aisle of the car. By the gleam
of it the young inventor caught sight of a man hurrying away, and he
felt sure the fellow who had put his hand under his pillow was the
man with the black mustache. He confirmed this suspicion a moment
later, for the man half turned, as if to look back, and the youth
saw the mustache.

"He--he was after my map!" thought Tom, with a gasp.

He sat bolt upright. What should he do? To raise an alarm now, he
felt, would only bring a denial from the man if he accused him.
There might also be a scene, and the man might get very indignant.
Then, too, Tom and his friends did not want their object made known,
as it would be in the event of Tom raising an outcry and stating
what was under his pillow.

He felt for the map case, opened it and saw, in the gleam of the
light, that it was safe.

"He didn't get it anyhow," murmured our hero. "I guess I won't say
anything until morning, though he did come like a thief in the night
to see if he could steal it."

Tom glanced to where his coat and other clothing hung in the little
berth-hammock, and a hasty search showed that his money and ticket
were safe.

"It was the map he was after all right," mused Tom. "I'll have a
talk with Mr. Damon in the morning about what's best to do. That's
why the fellow has been keeping such a close watch on us. He wanted
to see who had the map."

Then another thought came to Tom.

"If it was the map he was after," he whispered to himself, "he must
know what it's about. Therefore the Fogers must have told him. I'll
wager Andy or his father put this man up to steal the map. Andy's
afraid he hasn't got a copy of the right one. This is getting more
and more mysterious! We must be on our guard all the while. Well,
I'll see what I'll do in the morning."

But in the morning the man with the black mustache was not aboard
the train, and on inquiring of the conductor, Tom learned that the
mysterious stranger had gotten off at a way station shortly after
midnight.




CHAPTER IX

A VANDAL'S ACT


"Bless my penknife!" exclaimed Mr. Daman, the next morning, when he
had been told of Tom's experience in the night, "things are coming
to a pretty pass when our enemies adopt such tactics as this! What
can we do, Tom? Hadn't you better let one of us carry the map?"

"Oh, I guess not," answered the young inventor. "They have had one
try at me, and found that I wasn't napping. I don't believe they'll
try again. No, I'll carry the map."

Tom concealed it in an old wallet, as he thought it was less likely
to attract attention there than in the new case he formerly used.
Still he did not relax his vigilance, and his sleep for the next few
nights was uneasy, as he awakened several times, thinking he felt a
hand under his pillow.

At length Ned suggested that one of them sit up part of the night,
and keep an eye on Tom's berth. This was agreed to, and they divided
the hours of darkness into watches, each one taking a turn at
guarding the precious map. But they might have spared themselves the
trouble, for no further attempt was made to get it.

"I'd just like to know what Andy Foger's plans are?" said Tom one
afternoon, as they were within a few miles of Seattle. "He certainly
must have made up his mind quickly, after he saw the map, about
going in search of the gold."

"Maybe his father proposed it," suggested Ned. "I heard, in our
bank, that Mr. Foger has lost considerable money lately, and he may
need more."

"I shouldn't wonder. Well, if they are going to Sitka, Alaska, to
assemble their ship, I think they'll have trouble, for supplies are
harder to get there than in Seattle. But we'll soon be on our way
ourselves, if nothing happens. I hope all the parts of the RED CLOUD
arrive safely."

They did, as Tom learned a few hours later, when they had taken up
their quarters in a Seattle hotel, and he had made inquiries at the
railroad office. In the freight depot were all the boxes and crates
containing the parts of the big airship, and by comparison with a
list he had made, the young inventor found that not a single part
was missing.

"We'll soon have her together again," he said to his friends, "and
then we'll start for Alaska."

"Where are you going to assemble the airship?" asked Mr. Damon.

"I've got to hire some sort of a big shed," explained Tom. "I heard
of one I think I can get. It's out at the fair grounds, and was used
some time ago when they had a balloon ascension here. It will be
just what I need."

"How long before we can start for the gold valley?" asked the old
miner anxiously.

"Oh, in about a week," answered the lad, "that is, if everything
goes well."

Tom lost no time in getting to work. He had the different parts of
his airship carted to the big shed which he hired. This building was
on one edge of the fair grounds, and there was a large, level space
which was admirably adapted for trying the big craft, when once more
it was put together.

The gold-seekers worked hard, and to such good purpose that in three
days most of the ship was together once more, and the RED CLOUD
looked like herself again. Tom hired a couple of machinists to aid
him in assembling the motor, and some of the gas appliances and
other apparatus.

"Ha! Bless my rubber shoes!" cried Mr. Damon in delight, as he
looked at the big craft "This is like old times, Tom!"

"Yes, indeed," agreed our hero.

"Are you going to give it a preliminary tryout?" asked Ned.

"Oh, yes, I think we can do that to-morrow," replied Tom. "I want to
know that everything is in good working shape before I trust the
ship on the trip to the frozen north. There are several problems I
want to work out, too, for I think I will need a different kind of
gas up where the temperature is so low."

"It certainly is cold up here," agreed Ned, for they were now much
farther north than when they were in Shopton, and, besides, winter
was coming on. It was not the best time of the year to journey into
Alaska, but they had no choice. To delay, especially now, might mean
that their enemies would get ahead of them.

"We'll be warm in the airship, though; won't we?" asked Abe.

"Oh, yes," answered Tom. "We'll be warm, and have plenty to eat.
Which reminds me that I must begin to see about our stock of
provisions and other supplies, for we'll soon be on our way."

Work on the airship was hastened to such good advantage the next two
days that it was in shape for a trial flight, and, one afternoon,
the RED CLOUD was wheeled from the shed out into big field, the gas
was generated, and the motor started.

There was a little hitch, due to the fact that some of the machine
adjustments were wrong, but Tom soon had that remedied and then,
with the big propellers whirling around, the airship was sent
scudding across the field.

Another moment and it rose like a great eagle, and sailed through
the air, while a small crowd that had daily gathered in the hope of
seeing a flight, sent up a cheer.

"Does it work all right?" asked Ned anxiously, as he stood in the
pilothouse beside his chum.

"As good as it did in Shopton," answered the young inventor,
proudly.

"Bless my pocketbook! but that's lucky," exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Then
we can soon start, eh?"

"As soon as we are stocked up," replied the lad.

Tom put the airship through a number of "stunts" to test her
stability and the rudder control, much to the delight of the
gathering throng. Everything was found to work well, and after
ascending to a considerable height, to the no small alarm of the old
miner, Tom made a quick descent, with the motor shut off. The RED
CLOUD conducted herself perfectly, and there was nothing else to be
desired.

She was sent down to earth and wheeled back into the shed, and not
without some difficulty, for the crowd, which was now very large,
wanted to get near enough to touch the wonderful craft.

"To-morrow I'll arrange about the supplies and provisions, and we'll
stock her up," said Tom to his companions. "Now you folks had better
go back to the hotel."

"Aren't you coming?" asked Ned.

I'm going to bunk here in the shed to-night, said the young
inventor.

"What for?"

"I can't take any chances now that the RED CLOUD is in shape for
flying. Some of the Foger crowd might be hanging around, and break
in here to damage her."

"But the watchman will be on guard," suggested Ned, for since the
hiring of the shed, the young inventor had engaged a man to remain
on duty all night.

"I know," answered Tom Swift, "but I'm not going to take any
chances. I'll stay here with the watchman."

Ned offered to share the vigil with his chum, and, after some
objection Tom consented. The others went back to the hotel,
promising to return early in the morning.

Tom slept heavily that night, much heavier than he was in the habit
of doing. So did Ned, and their deep breathing as they lay in their
staterooms, in the cabin of the airship, told of physical weariness,
for they had worked hard to re-assemble the RED CLOUD.

The watchman was seated in a chair just inside the big door of the
shed, near a small stove in which was a fire to take off the chill
of the big place. The guard had slept all day, and there was no
excuse for him nodding in the way that he did.

"Queer, how drowsy I feel," he murmured several times. "It's only a
little after midnight, too," he added, looking at his watch, "Guess
I'll walk around a bit to rouse myself."

He firmly intended to do this, but he thought he would wait just a
few minutes more, and he stretched out his legs and got comfortable
in the chair.

Three minutes more and the watchman was asleep--sound asleep, while
a strange, sweet, sickish odor seemed to fill the atmosphere about
him.

There was a noise at the door of the shed, a door in which there
were several cracks. A man outside laid aside something that looked
like an air pump. He applied one eye to a crack, and looked in on
the sleeping watchman.

"He's off," the man murmured. "I thought he'd never get to sleep!
Now to get in and dose those two lads! Then I'll have the place to
myself!"

There was a clicking noise about the lock on the shed door. It was
not a very secure lock at best, and, under the skilful fingers of
the midnight visitor, it quickly gave way. The man entered. He gave
one look at the slumbering watchman, listened to his heavy
breathing, and then went softly toward the airship, which looked to
be immense in the comparatively small shed--taking up nearly all the
space.

The intruder peered in through the cabin windows where Ned and Tom
were asleep. Once more there was in the atmosphere a sickish odor.
The man again worked the instrument which was like a small air pump,
taking care not to get his own face too near it. Presently he
stopped and listened.

"They're doped," he murmured. He arose, and took from his mouth and
nose a handkerchief saturated with some chemical that had rendered
him immune to the effects of the sleep-producing that he had
generated. "Sound asleep," he added. Then, taking out a long, keen
knife, the vandal stole toward where the great wings of the RED
CLOUD stretched out in the dim light like the pinions of a bird.
There was a ripping, tearing, rending sound, as the vandal cut and
slashed, but Tom, Ned and the watchman slumbered on.




CHAPTER X

TOM IS HELD UP


Tom Swift stirred uneasily in his heavy sleep. He dreamed that he
was again in his berth in the railroad car, and that the thief was
feeling under his pillow for the map. Only, this time, there seemed
to be hands feeling about his clothing, trying to locate his inner
pockets.

The lad murmured something unintelligible, but he did not awaken.
The fumes prevented that. However, his movements showed that the
effect of the drug was wearing off. It was intended only for
temporary use, and it lasted less time than it would otherwise have
done in a warmer, moister climate, for the cold, crisp air that
penetrated the shed from outside dispelled the fumes.

"Guess I'd better not chance it," murmured the intruder. "He may not
have it on him, and if I go through all his pockets I'll wake him
up. Anyhow, I've done what they paid me for. I don't believe they'll
sail in this airship."

The vandal gave one glance at the sleeping lads, and stole from the
cabin of the craft. He looked at his work of ruin, and then tiptoed
past the slumbering watchman. A moment later and he was outside the
shed, hurrying away through the night.

Several hours after this Mr. Damon and the old miner were pounding
on the door of the shed. Mr. Parker, the scientist, had remained at
the hotel, for he said he wanted to work out a few calculations
regarding some of his theories.

"I thought we'd find them up by this time," spoke the eccentric man,
as he again knocked on the door. "Tom said he had lots to do to-day."

"Maybe they are working inside, and can't hear our knocks,"
suggested Abe. "Try th' door."

"Bless my heart! I never thought of that," exclaimed Mr. Damon. "I
believe I will."

The door swung open as he pushed it, for it had not been locked when
the intruder left. The first thing Mr. Damon saw was the watchman,
still asleep in his chair.

"Bless my soul!" the old man shouted. "Look at this, Abe!"

"Something's wrong!" cried the miner, sniffing the air. "There's
been crooked work here! Where are the boys?"

Mr. Damon was close to the airship. He looked in the cabin window.

"Here they are, and they're both asleep, too!" he called. "And--bless
my eyeglasses! Look at the airship! The planes and wings are
all cut and slashed! Something has happened! The RED CLOUD is all
but ruined!"

Abe hastened to his side. He looked at the damage done, and a fierce
look came over his face.

"The Fogers again!" he murmured. "We'll pay 'em back for this! But
first we must see to the boys!"

They needed small attention, however. The opening of the big door
had let in a flood of fresh air, and this dispelled the last of the
fumes. The watchman was the first to revive. The sleep caused by the
chemical, sprayed from the air-pump by the vandal, had been
succeeded by a natural slumber, and this was the case with Ned and
Tom. They were soon aroused, and looked with wonder, not unmixed
with rage, at the work done in the night.

Every one of the principal planes of the airship, each of the
rudders, and some of the auxiliary wings had been cut by a sharp
knife--some in several places. The canvas hung in shreds and
patches, and the trim RED CLOUD looked like some old tramp airship
now. Tom could scarcely repress a groan.

"Who did it?" he gasped.

"And with us here on guard!" added Ned.

"I--I must have fallen asleep," admitted the watchman in confusion.

"You were all asleep," said Mr. Damon. "I couldn't rouse you!"

"And there was th' smell of chloroform, or something like it in th'
shed," added the miner.

"But look at the airship!" groaned Tom.

"Is it ruined--can't we go to the valley of gold?" asked Ned.

Tom did not answer for a few minutes. He was walking around looking
at his damaged craft. The sleepy feeling was rapidly leaving him, as
well as Ned and the watchman.

"Bless my watch chain!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "What an ugly, mean
piece of work. Can you repair it, Tom?"

"I think so," was the hesitating answer. "It is not as bad as I
feared at first. Luckily the gas-bag has not been touched, for, if
it had, we could hardly have repaired it. I can fix the wings and
the rudders. The propellers have not been damaged, nor has the motor
been touched. I think they must have made another attempt to take
the map off me," he went on, as he looked at several pockets that
had been turned inside out.

An examination of the door showed how the lock had been forced, and
the adventurers could easily guess the rest. But who the midnight
vandal was they could not tell, though Tom and the others were sure
it was some one hired by the Fogers.

"They wanted to delay us," said Tom. "They thought this would hold
us back, but it won't--for long. We'll get right to work, and make
new planes and rudders. Fortunately the framework isn't hurt any."

Once Tom got into action nothing held him back. He hardly wanted to
stop for meals. New canvas was ordered, and that very afternoon some
of the damaged wings had been repaired. In the meanwhile the stores
and provisions that had been ordered were arriving, and, under the
direction of the miner and Mr. Damon were put in the RED CLOUD. Tom
and Ned, with the help of a man they hired, worked diligently to
replace the damaged planes and rudders. Mr. Parker came out to the
airship shed, but he was of little use as a helper, for he was
continually stopping to jot down some memoranda about an observation
he thought of, or else he would lay aside his tools to go outside,
look at the weather, and make predictions.

But Tom and the others labored to such good advantage that in three
days they had repaired most of the damage done. Luckily the vandal
had cut and slashed in a hurry, and his malicious work was only half
accomplished. There was no clue to his identity.

No trace was seen of the Fogers, and Tom hardly expected it, for he
thought they were in Sitka by this time. Nor were any suspicious
persons seen hanging around the shed. The adventurers left their
rooms at the hotel, and took up their quarters in the airship that
would soon be their home for many days. They wanted to be where they
could watch the craft, and two guards were engaged.

"We'll start to-morrow," Tom announced gaily one evening when, after
a hard day's work the last of the damaged planes had been repaired.

"Start fer th' valley of gold?" asked the miner.

"Yes. Everything is in good shape now. I want to go into town, to
send some messages home, telling dad we'll soon be on our way, and I
also want to get a few things."

"Shall I come?" asked Ned.

"No, I'd rather you'd stay here," spoke Tom, in a low voice. "We
can't take any more chances of being delayed, and, as it's pretty
well known that we'll sail to-morrow, the Foger crowd may try some
more of their tricks. No, I'll go to town alone, Ned. I'll soon be
back, however. You stay here."

But Tom came nearly never coming back. As he was returning from
sending the messages, and purchasing a few things he needed for the
trip, he passed through a dark street. He was walking along,
thinking of what the future might hold for him and his companions,
after they reached the caves of ice, when, just as he got to a high
board fence, surrounding some vacant lots, he heard some one whisper
hoarsely:

"Here he comes!"

The young inventor was on his guard instantly. He jumped back to
avoid a moving shadow, but was too late. Something struck him on the
back of his head, and he felt his senses leaving him. He struggled
against the feeling, and he realized, even in that exciting moment,
that the thick collar of his heavy overcoat, which he had turned up
because of a cold wind, had, perhaps, saved him from a broken skull.

"Hold him!" commanded another voice. "I'll go through him!"

The packages dropped from Tom's nerveless fingers. He felt himself
sinking down, in spite of his fierce determination not to succumb.
He felt several hands moving rapidly about his body, and then he
struck blindly out at the footpads.




CHAPTER XI

OFF FOR THE FROZEN NORTH


Tom Swift felt as if he was struggling in some dream or nightmare.
He felt strong hands holding him and saw evil faces leering at him.

Then gradually his brain cleared. His muscles, that had been
weakened by the cowardly blow, grew strong. He felt his fist land
heavily on some one's face. He heard a smothered gasp of pain.

Then came the sound of footsteps running--Tom heard the "ping" of a
policeman's night-stick on the sidewalk.

"Here come the cops!" he heard one voice exclaim.

"Did you get it?" asked another.

"No, I can't find it. Cut for it now!"

They released the young inventor so suddenly that he staggered about
and almost fell.

The next moment Tom was looking into the face of a big policeman,
who was half supporting him.

"What's the matter?" asked the officer.

"Hold-up, I guess," mumbled the lad. "There they go!" he pointed
toward two dark forms slipping along down the dimly-lighted street.

The officer drew his revolver, and fired two shots in the air, but
the fleeing figures did not stop.

"How did it happen?" asked the policeman. "Did they get anything
from you?"

"No--I guess not," answered Tom. He saw the packages containing his
purchases lying where they had fallen. A touch told him his watch
and pocketbook were safe. The precious map was in a belt about his
waist, and that had not been removed. "No, they didn't get
anything," he assured the officer.

"I came along too quick for 'em, I guess," spoke the bluecoat. "This
is a bad neighborhood. There have been several hold-ups here of
late, but I was on the job too soon for these fellows. Hello, Mike,"
as another officer came running up in answer to the shots and the
raps of the night-stick. "Couple of strong-arm-men tackled this
young fellow just now. I saw something going on as I turned the
corner, and I rapped and ran up. They went down that way. I fired at
'em. You take after 'em, Mike, and I'll stay here. Don't believe you
can land 'em, but try! I came up too quick to allow 'em to get
anything, though."

Tom did not contradict this. He knew, however, that, had the men who
attacked him wished to take his watch or money, they could have done
it several times before the officer arrived.

"It was the map they were after," thought Tom, "not my watch or
money. This is more of the Foger's work. We must get away from
here."

The policeman inquired for more particulars from Tom, who related
how the hold-up had taken place. The young inventor, however, said
nothing about the map he carried, letting the officer think it was
an ordinary attempt at robbery, for Tom did not want any reference
in the newspapers to his search for the valley of gold.

Presently the other policeman returned, having been unable to get
any trace of the daring men. The two bluecoats wanted to accompany
Tom back to the airship shed, for his own safety, but he declared
there was no more danger, and, after having given his name, so that
the affair might be reported at headquarters, he was allowed to go
on his way. His head ached from the blow, but otherwise he was
unhurt.

"Those fellows have been keeping watch for me," the lad reasoned, as
he walked quickly toward the airship shed. "They must have been
shadowing me, and they hid there until I came back. Andy Foger and
his father must be getting desperate. I think I know why, too. That
little dig I gave Andy about his map is bearing fruit. He begins to
think it's the wrong map, and he wants to get hold of the right one.
Well, they shan't if I can help it. We'll be away from here in the
morning."

There was indignation and some alarm among Tom's friends when he
told his story a little later that night.

"Bless my walking-stick!" cried Mr. Damon. "You'll need a bodyguard
after this."

"I'd just like t' git my hands on them fellers!" exclaimed the old
miner. "I'd show 'em!" and a look at his rugged frame and his
muscular arms and gnarled hands showed Tom and Ned that in the event
of a fight they could count much on Abe Abercrombie.

"I am glad there will be no more delays, and that we will soon be
moving northward," spoke Mr. Parker, a little later. "I am anxious
to confirm my theory about the advance of the ice crust, I met a man
to-day who had just returned from the north of Alaska. He said that
a severe winter had already set in up there. So I am anxious to get
to the ice caves."

"So am I," added Tom, but it was for a different reason.

They were all up early the next morning, for there were several
things to look after before they started on the trip that might
bring much of danger to the adventurers. Under Tom's direction, more
gas was generated, and forced into the big bag. A last adjustment
was made of the planes, wing tips and rudders, and the motor was
given a try-out.

"I guess everything is all right," announced the young inventor.
"We'll take her out."

The RED CLOUD was wheeled from the big shed, and placed on the open
lot, where she would have room to rush across the ground to acquire
momentum enough to rise in the air. Tom, whenever it was practical,
always mounted this way, rather than by means of the lifting gas,
as, in the event of a wind, he would have better control of the
ship, while it was ascending into the upper currents of air, than
when it was rising like a balloon.

"All aboard!" cried the lad, as he looked to see that the course was
clear. Early as it was, there was quite a crowd on hand to witness
the flight, as there had been every day of late, for the population
of Seattle was curious regarding the big craft of the air.

"Let her go!" cried Ned Newton, enthusiastically.

Tom took his place in the steering-tower, or pilothouse, which was
forward of the main cabin. Ned was in the engine-room, ready to give
any assistance if needed. Mr. Damon, Mr. Parker and Abe Abercrombie
were in the main cabin, looking out of the windows at the rapidly
increasing throng.

"Here we go!" cried the young inventor, as he pulled the lever
starting the motor, There was a buzz and a hum. The powerful
propellers whirred around like blurs of light. Forward shot the
great airship over the ground, gathering speed at every revolution
of the blades.

Tom tilted the forward rudder to lift the ship. Suddenly it shot
over the heads of the crowd. There was a cheer and some applause.

"Off for the frozen north!" cried Ned, waving his cap.

Tom shifted the rudder, to change the course of the airship. Mr.
Damon was gazing on the crowd below.

"Tom! Tom!" he cried suddenly. "There's the man with the black
mustache--the man who tried to rob you in the sleeping-car!" He
pointed downward to some one in the throng.

"He can't get us now!" exclaimed Tom, as he increased the speed of
the RED CLOUD, and then, taking up a telescope, after setting the
automatic steering gear, Tom pointed the glass at the person whom
Mr. Damon had indicated.




CHAPTER XII

PELTED BY HAILSTONES


"Yes, that's the man all right," observed the lad. "But if he came
here to have another try for the map, he's too late. I hope we don't
land now until we are in the valley of gold." Tom passed the
telescope to Ned, who confirmed the identification.

"Perhaps he came to see if we started, and then he'll report to Andy
Foger or his father by telegraph," suggested Mr. Damon.

"Perhaps," admitted Tom. "Anyhow, we're well rid of our enemies--at
least for a time. They can't follow us up in the air." He turned
another lever and the RED CLOUD shot forward at increased speed.

"Maybe Andy will race us," suggested Ned.

"I'm not afraid of anything his airship can do," declared Tom. "I
don't believe it will even get up off the ground, though he did make
a short flight before he packed up to follow us. It's a wonder he
wouldn't think of something himself, instead of trying to pattern
after some one else. He tried to beat me in building a speeding
automobile, and now he wants to get ahead of me in an airship. Well,
let him try. I'll beat him out, just as I've done before."

They were now over the outskirts of Seattle, flying along about a
thousand feet high, and they could dimly make out curious crowds
gazing up at them. The throng that had been around the airship shed
had disappeared from view behind a little hill, and, of course, the
man with the black mustache was no longer visible, but Tom felt as
if his sinister eyes were still gazing upward, seeking to discern
the occupants of the airship.

"We're well on our way now," observed Ned, after a while, during
which interval he and Tom had inspected the machinery, and found it
working satisfactorily.

"Yes, and the RED CLOUD is doing better than she ever did before,"
said Tom. "I think it did her good to take her apart and put her
together again. It sort of freshened her up. This machine is my
special pride. I hope nothing happens to her on this journey to the
caves of ice."

"If my theory is borne out, we will have to be careful not to get
caught in the crush of ice, as it makes its way toward the south,"
spoke Mr. Parker with an air as if he almost wished such a thing to
happen, that he might be vindicated.

"Oh, we'll take good care that the RED CLOUD isn't nipped between
two bergs," Tom declared.

But he little knew of the dire fate that was to overtake the RED
CLOUD, and how close a call they were to have for their very lives.

"No matter what care you exercise, you cannot overcome the awful
power of the grinding ice," declared the gloomy scientist. "I
predict that we will see most wonderful and terrifying sights."

"Bless my hatband!" cried Mr. Damon, "don't say such dreadful
things, Parker my dear man! Be more cheerful; can't you?"

"Science cannot be cheerful when foretelling events of a dire
nature," was the response. "I would not do my duty if I did not hold
to my theories."

"Well, just hold to them a little more closely," suggested Mr.
Damon. "Don't tell them to us so often, and have them get on our
nerves, Parker, my dear man. Bless my nail-file! be more cheerful.
And that reminds me, when are we going to have dinner, Tom?"

"Whenever you want it, Mr. Damon. Are you going to act as cook
again?"

"I think I will, and I'll just go to the galley now, and see about
getting a meal. It will take my mind off the dreadful things Mr.
Parker says."

But if the gloomy scientific man heard this little "dig" he did not
respond to it. He was busy jotting down figures on a piece of paper,
multiplying and dividing them to get at some result in a complicated
problem he was working on, regarding the power of an iceberg in
proportion to its size, to exert a lateral pressure when sliding
down a grade of fifteen per cent.

Mr. Damon got an early dinner, as they had breakfasted almost at
dawn that morning, in order to get a good start. The meal was much
enjoyed, and to Abe Abercrombie was quite a novelty, for he had
never before partaken of food so high up in the air, the barograph
of the RED CLOUD showing an elevation of a little over twelve
thousand feet.

"It's certainly great," the old miner observed, as he looked down
toward the earth below them, stretched out like some great relief
map. "It sure is wonderful an' some scrumptious! I never thought I'd
be ridin' one of these critters. But they're th' only thing t' git
t' this hidden valley with. We might prospect around for a year, and
be driven back by the Indians and Eskimos a dozen times. But with
this we can go over their heads, and get all the gold we want."

"Is there enough to give every one all he wants?" asked Tom, with a
quizzical smile. "I don't know that I ever had enough."

"Me either," added Ned Newton.

"Oh, there's lots of gold there," declared the old miner. "The thing
to do is to get it and we can sure do that now."

The remainder of the day passed uneventfully, though Tom cast
anxious looks at the weather as night set in, and Ned, noting his
chum's uneasiness, asked:

"Worrying about anything, Tom?"

"Yes, I am," was the reply. "I think we're in for a hard storm, and
I don't know just how the airship will behave up in these northern
regions. It's getting much colder, and the gas in the bag is
condensing more than I thought it would. I will have to increase our
speed to keep us moving along at this elevation."

The motor was adjusted to give more power, and, having set it so
that it, as well as the rudders, would be controlled automatically,
Tom rejoined his companions in the main cabin, where, as night
settled down, they gathered to eat the evening meal.

Through the night the great airship plowed her way. At times Tom
arose to look at some of the recording instruments. It was growing
colder, and this further reduced the volume of the gas, but as the
speed of the ship was sufficient to send her along, sustained by the
planes and wings alone, if necessary, the young inventor did not
worry much.

Morning broke gray and cheerless. A few flakes of snow fell. There
was every indication of a heavy storm. They were high above a
desolate and wild country now, hovering over a sparsely settled
region where they could see great forests, stretches of snow-covered
rocks, and towering mountain crags.

The snow, which had been lazily falling, suddenly ceased. Tom looked
out in surprise. A moment later there came a sound as if some giant
fingers were beating a tattoo on the roof of the main cabin.

"What's that!" cried Ned.

"Bless my umbrella! has anything happened?" demanded Mr. Damon.

"It's a hail storm!" exclaimed Tom. "We've run into a big hail
storm. Look at those frozen stones! They're as big as hens' eggs!"

On a little platform in front of the steering-house could be seen
falling immense hailstones. They played a tattoo on the wooden
planks.

"A hail storm! Bless my overshoes!" cried Mr. Damon.

"A hail storm!" echoed Mr. Parker. "I expected we would have one.
The hailstones will become even larger than this!"

"Cheerful," remarked Tom in a low voice, with an apprehensive look
at Ned.

"Is there any danger?" asked his chum.

"Danger? Plenty of it," replied the young inventor. "The frozen
particles may rip open the gas bag." He stopped suddenly and looked
at a gage on the wall of the steering-tower--a gage that showed the
gas pressure.

"One compartment of the bag has been ripped open!" cried Tom. "The
vapor is escaping! The whole bag may soon be torn apart!"

The noise of the pelting hailstones increased. The roar of the
storm, the bombardment of the icy globules, and the moaning of the
wind struck terror to the hearts of the gold-seekers.

"What's to be done?" yelled Ned.

"We must go up, to get above the storm, or else descend and find
some shelter!" answered Tom. "I'll first see if I can send the ship
up above the clouds!"

He increased the speed of the motor so that the propellers would aid
in taking the ship higher up, while the gas-generating machine was
set in operation to pour the lifting vapor into the big bag.




CHAPTER XIII

A FRIGHTENED INDIAN


The violence of the hail storm, the clatter of the frozen pellets as
they bombarded the airship, the rolling, swaying motion of the craft
as Tom endeavored to send it aloft, all combined to throw the
passengers of the RED CLOUD into a state of panic.

"Bless my very existence!" cried Mr. Damon, "this is almost as bad
as when we were caught in the hurricane at Earthquake Island!"

"I am sure that this storm is but the forerunner of some dire
calamity!" declared Mr. Parker.

"I'm afraid it's all up with us," came from Abe Abercrombie, as he
looked about for some way of escape.

"Do you think you can pull us through, Tom?" asked Ned Newton, who,
not having had much experience in airships had yet to learn Tom's
skill in manipulating them.

The young inventor alone seemed to keep his nerve. Coolly and calmly
he stood at his post of duty, shifting the wing planes from moment
to moment, managing the elevation rudder, and, at the same time,
keeping his eye on the registering dial of the gas-generating
machine.

"It's all right," said Tom, more easily than he felt. "We are going
up slowly. You might see if you can induce the gas machine to do any
better, Mr. Damon. We are wasting some of the vapor because of the
leak in the bag, but we can manufacture it faster than it escapes,
so I guess we'll be all right."

"Mr. Parker, may I ask you to oil the main motor? You will see the
places marked where the oil is to go in. Ned, you help him. Here,
Abe, come over here and give me a hand. This wind makes the rudders
hard to twist."

The young inventor could not have chosen a better method of
relieving the fears of his friends than by giving them something to
do to take their minds off their own troubles. They hurried to the
tasks he had assigned to them, and, in a few minutes, there were no
more doubts expressed.

Not that the RED CLOUD was out of danger, Far from it. The storm was
increasing in violence, and the hailstones seemed to double in
number. Then, too, being forced upward as she was, the airship's bag
was pelted all the harder, for the speed of the craft, added to the
velocity of the falling chunks of hail, made them strike on the
surface of the ship with greater violence.

Tom was anxiously watching the barograph, to note their height. The
RED CLOUD was now about two and a half miles high, and slowly
mounting upward. The gas machine was working to its fullest
capacity, and the fact that they did not rise more quickly told Tom,
more plainly than words could have done, that there were several
additional leaks in the gas-bag.

"I'll take her up another thousand feet," he announced grimly.
"Then, if we're not above the storm it will be useless to go
higher."

"Why?" asked Ned, who had come back to stand beside his chum.

"Because we can't possibly get above the storm without tearing the
ship to pieces. I had rather descend."

"But won't that be just as bad?"

"Not necessarily. There are often storms in the upper regions which
do not get down to the surface of the earth, snow and hail storms
particularly. Hail, you know, is supposed to be formed by drops of
rain being hurled up and down in a sort of circular, spiral motion
through alternate strata of air--first freezing and then warm, which
accounts for the onion-like layers seen when a hailstone is cut in
half."

"That is right," broke in Mr. Parker, who was listening to the young
inventor. "By going down this hail storm may change into a harmless
rain storm. But, in spite of that fact, we are in a dangerous
climate, where we must expect all sorts of queer happenings."

"Nice, comfortable sort of a companion to have along on a gold-hunting
expedition, isn't He?" asked Tom of Ned, making a wry face
as Mr. Parker moved away. "But I haven't any time to think of that.
Say, this is getting fierce!"

Well might he say so. The wind had further increased in violence,
and while the storm of hailstones seemed to be about the same, the
missiles had nearly doubled in size.

"Better go down," advised Ned. "We may fall if you don't."

"Guess I will," assented Tom. "There's no use going higher. I doubt
if I could, anyhow, with all this wind pressure, and with the
gas-bag leaking. Down she is!"

As he spoke he shifted the levers, and changed the valve wheels. In
an instant the RED CLOUD began to shoot toward the earth.

"What's happened? What in th' name of Bloody Gulch are we up
ag'in'?" demanded the old miner, springing to his feet.

"We're going down--that's all," answered Tom, calmly, but he was far
from feeling that way, and he had grave fears for the safety of
himself and his companions.

Down, down, down went the RED CLOUD, in the midst of the hail storm.
But if the gold-seekers had hoped to escape the pelting of the
frozen globules they were mistaken. The stones still seemed to
increase in size and number. The gas machine register showed a
sudden lack of pressure, not due to the shutting off of the
apparatus.

"Look!" cried Ned, pointing to the dial.

"Yes--more punctures," said Tom, grimly.

"What's to be done?" asked Mr. Damon, who had finished the task Tom
allotted to him. "Bless my handkerchief! what's to be done?"

"Seek shelter if the storm doesn't stop when we get to the earth
level," answered Tom.

"Shelter? What sort of shelter? There are no airship sheds in this
desolate region."

"I may be able to send the ship under some overhanging mountain
crag," answered the young inventor, "and that will keep off the
hailstones."

Eagerly Tom and Ned, who stood together in the pilothouse peered
forward through the storm.

The wind was less violent now that they were in the lower currents
of air, but the hail had not ceased.

Suddenly Tom gave a cry. Ned looked at him anxiously. Had some new
calamity befallen them? But Tom's voice sounded more in relief than
in alarm. The next instant he called:

"Look ahead there, Ned, and tell me what you see."

"I see something big and black," answered the other lad, after a
moment's hesitation. "Why, it's a big black hole!" he added.

"That's what I made it out to be," went on Tom, "but I wanted to be
sure. It's the opening to a cave or hole in the side of the
mountain. I take it."

"You're right," agreed Ned.

"Then we're safe," declared Tom.

"Safe? How?"

"I'm going to take the RED CLOUD in there out of the storm."

"Can you do it? Is the opening big enough?"

"Plenty. It's larger than my shed at home, Jove! but I'm glad I saw
that in time, or there would have been nothing left of the gas-bag!"

With skilful hands Tom turned the rudders and sent the airship down
on a slant toward the earth, aiming for the entrance to the cave,
which loomed up in the storm. When the craft was low enough down so
that the superstructure would not scrape the top of the cave, Tom
sent her ahead on the level. But he need have had no fears, for the
hole was large enough to have admitted a craft twice the size of the
RED CLOUD.

A few minutes later the airship slid inside the great cavern, as
easily as if coming to rest in the yard of Tom's house. The roof of
the cave was high over their heads, and they were safe from the
storm. The cessation from the deafening sound of the pelting
hailstones seemed curious to them at first.

"Well, bless my shoelaces! if this isn't luck!" cried Mr. Damon, as
he opened the door of the cabin, and looked about the cave in which
they now found themselves. It was comparatively light, for the
entrance was very large, though the rear of the cavern was in gloom.

"Yes, indeed, we got to it just in time,'" agreed Tom. "Now let's
see what sort of a place it is. We'll have to explore it."

"There may be a landslide, or the roof may come down on our heads,"
objected Mr. Parker.

"Oh, my dear Parker! please be a little more cheerful," begged Mr.
Damon.

The adventurers followed Tom from the airship, and all but the young
inventor gazed curiously at the interior of the cave. His first
thought was for his airship. He glanced up at the gas-bag, and noted
several bad rents in it.

"I hope we can fix them," Tom thought dubiously.

But the attention of all was suddenly arrested by something that
occurred just then. From the dark recess of the cavern there sounded
a fearful yell or scream. It was echoed back a thousand-fold by the
rocky walls of the cave, Then there dashed past the little group of
gold-seekers a dark figure.

"Look out! It's a bear!" shouted Mr. Damon. "A bear! It's an Eskimo
Indian!" yelled Abe Abercrombie, "an' he's skeered nigh t' death!
Look at him run!"

As they gazed toward the lighted entrance of the cave they saw
leaping and running from it an Indian who quickly scudded out into
the hail storm.

"An Indian," exclaimed Tom. "An Indian in the cave! If there's one,
there may be more. I guess we'd better look to our guns. They may
attack us!" and he hurried back into the airship, followed by Ned
and the others.




CHAPTER XIV

THE RIVAL AIRSHIP


Well armed, the adventurers again ventured out into the cave. But
they need not have been alarmed so soon, for there were no signs of
any more Indians.

"I guess that one was a stray Eskimo who took shelter in here from
the storm," said Abe Abercrombie.

"Are we in the neighborhood of the Alaskan Indians and Eskimos?"
inquired Ned.

"Yes, there are lots of Indians in this region," answered the old
miner, "but not so many Eskimos. A few come down from th' north, but
we'll see more of them, an' fewer of th' pure-blooded Indians as we
get nearer th' valley of gold. Though t' my mind th' Indians an'
Eskimos are pretty much alike."

"Well, if we don't have to defend ourselves from an attack of
Indians, suppose we look over the airship," proposed Tom.

"It's too dark to see very much," objected Ned. But this was
overcome when Tom started up a dynamo, and brought out a portable
search-light which was played upon the superstructure of the RED
CLOUD. The gas-bag was the only part of the craft they feared for,
as the hailstones could not damage the iron or wooden structure and
the planes were made in sections, and in such a manner that rents in
them could easily be repaired. So, in fact, could the gas-bag be
mended, but it was harder work.

"Well, she's got some bad tears in her," announced Tom as the light
flashed over the big bag. "Luckily I have plenty of the material,
and some cement, so I think we can mend the rents, though it will
take some days. Nothing could have been better for us than this
cave. We'll stay here until we're ready to go on."

"Unless the Indians drive us out," said Abe, in a low tone.

"Why, do you think there is any danger of that?" inquired Tom.

"Well, th' brown-skinned beggars aren't any too friendly," responded
the old miner. "Th' one that was in here will be sure to tell th'
others of some big spirit that flew into th' cave, an' they'll be
crowdin' around here when th' storm's over. It may be we can fight
'em off, though."

"Maybe they won't attack us," suggested Ned, hopefully. "Perhaps we
can make them believe we are spirits, and that it will be unlucky to
interfere with us."

"Perhaps," admitted Abe, "though my experience has been that these
Indians are a bad lot. They haven't much respect for spirits of any
kind, an' they'll soon find out we're human. But then, we'll wait
an' see what happens."

"And, in the meantime, have something to eat," put in Mr. Damon.
"Bless my knife and fork! but the hail storm gave me an appetite."

In fact, there were few things which did not give Mr. Damon an
appetite, Tom thought with a smile. But the meal idea was considered
very timely, and soon the amateur cook was busy in the galley of the
airship, whence speedily came savory odors. The electric lights were
switched on, and the adventurers were quickly made comfortable in
the cave, which so well sheltered the RED CLOUD. Tom completed his
inspection of the craft, and was relieved to find that while there
were a number of small rents, none was very large, and all could be
mended in time.

Abe Abercrombie took a look outside the cave after the meal had been
served. The old miner declared that they had made a good advance on
their northern journey for, though he could not tell their exact
location, he knew by the character of the landscape that they had
passed the boundaries of Alaska.

"A few more days' traveling at the rate we came will bring us to the
Snow Mountains and the valley of gold," he said.

"Well, we won't average such speed as we did during the hail storm,"
said Tom. "The wind of that carried us along at a terrific pace. But
we will get there in plenty of time, I think."

"Why; is there any particular rush?" asked Ned.

"There's no telling when the Fogers may appear," answered the young
inventor in a low voice. "But now we must get to work to repair
damage."

The hail storm had ceased, and, with the passing of the clouds the
cave was made lighter. But Tom did not depend on this, for he set up
powerful searchlights, by the gleams of which he and his companions
began the repairing of the torn gas-bag.

They worked all the remainder of that day, and were at it again
early the next morning, making good progress.

"We can go forward again, in about two days," spoke Tom. "I want to
give the cement on the patches plenty of chance to dry."

"Then I will have time to go out and make some observations, will I
not?" asked Mr. Parker. "I think this cave is a very old one, and I
may be able to find some evidences in it that the sea of ice is
slowly working its way down from the polar regions."

"I hope you don't," whispered Ned to Tom, who shook his head
dubiously as the gloomy scientist left the cave.

The weather was very cold, but, in the cavern it was hardly noticed.
The adventurers were warmly dressed, and when they did get chilly
from working over the airship, they had but to go into the well-heated
and cozy cabin to warm themselves.

It was on the third day of their habitation in the cave, and work on
putting the patches on the gas-bag was almost finished. Mr. Parker
had gone out to make further observations, his previous ones not
having satisfied him. Tom was on an improvised platform, putting a
patch on top of the bag, when he heard a sudden yell, and some one
dashed into the cavern.

"They're coming! They're coming!" cried a voice, and Tom, looking
down, saw Mr. Parker, apparently in a state of great fear.

"What's coming?" demanded the young inventor, "the icebergs?"

"No--the Indians!" yelled the scientist. "A whole tribe of them is
rushing this way!"

"I thought so!" cried Abe Abercrombie. "Where's my gun?" and he
dashed into the airship.

Tom slid down off the platform.

"Get ready for a fight!" he gasped. "Where are you, Ned?"

"Here I am. We'd better get to the mouth of the cave, and drive 'em
back from there."

"Yes. If I'd only thought, we could have blockaded it in some way.
It's as big as a barn now, and they can rush us if they have a mind
to. But we'll do our best!"

The adventurers were now all armed, even to Mr. Parker. The
scientist had recovered from his first fright, when he spied the
Indians coming over the snow, as he was "observing" some natural
phenomenon. Tom, even in his excitement, noticed that the professor
was curiously examining his gun, evidently more with a view to
seeing how it was made, and on which principle it was operated,
rather than to discover how to use it.

"If it comes to a fight, just point it at the Indians, pull the
trigger, and work that lever," explained the young inventor. "It's
an automatic gun."

"I see," answered Mr. Parker. "Very curious. I had no idea they
worked this way."

"Oh, if I only had my electric rifle in shape!" sighed Tom, as he
dashed forward at the side of Ned.

"Your electric rifle?"

"Yes, I've got a new kind of weapon--very effective. I have it
almost finished. It's in the airship, but I can't use it just yet.
However, maybe these repeaters will do the work."

By this time they were at the entrance of the cave, and, looking out
they saw about a hundred Indians, dressed in furs, striding across
the snowy plain that stretched out from the foot of the mountain in
which was the cavern.

"They're certainly comin' on," observed Abe, grimly. "Git ready for
'em, boys!"

The gold-seekers lined up at the mouth of the cave, with guns in
their hands. At the sight of this small, but formidable force, the
Indians halted. They were armed with guns of ancient make, while
some had spears, and others bows and arrows. A few had grabbed up
stones as weapons.

There appeared to be a consultation going on among them, and,
presently, one of the number, evidently a chief or a spokesman, gave
his gun to one of his followers, and, holding his hands above his
head, while he waved a rag that might have once been white, came
forward.

"By Jove!" exclaimed Tom. "It's a flag of truce! He wants to talk
with us I believe!"

"Bless my cartridges!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Can they speak
English?"

"A little," answered Abe Abercrombie. "I can talk some of their
lingo, too. Maybe I'd better see what they want."

"I guess it would be a good plan," suggested Tom, and, accordingly
the old miner stepped forward. The Indian came on, until Abe
motioned for him to halt.

"I reckon that's as far as it'll be healthy for you t' come," spoke
Abe, grimly. "Now what do you fellers want?"

Thereupon there ensued a rapid exchange of jargon between the miner
and the Indian. Abe seemed much relieved as the talk went on, until
there came what seemed like a demand on the part of the dark-hued
native.

"No, you don't! None of that!" muttered Abe. "If you had your way
you'd take everything we have."

"What is it? What does he want?" asked Tom in a low voice.

"Why, the beggar began fair enough," replied the miner. "He said one
of their number had been in the cave when a storm came an' saw a big
spirit fly in, with men on its back. He ran away an' now others have
come to see what it was. They don't guess it's an airship, for
they've never seen one, but they know we're white folks, an' they
always want things white folks have got."

"This fellow is a sort of chief, an' he says the white folks?--that's
us, you know?--have taken th' Indians' cave. He says he doesn't
want t' have any trouble, an' that we can stay here as long as we
like, but that we must give him an' his followers a lot of food.
Says they hain't got much. Land! Those beggars would eat us out of
everything we had if we'd let 'em!"

"What are you going to tell them?" inquired Mr. Damon.

"I'm goin' t' tell 'em t' go t' grass, or words t' that effect,"
replied Abe. "They haven't any weapons that amount t' anything, an'
we can stand 'em off. Besides, we'll soon be goin' away from here;
won't we, Tom?"

"Yes, but--"

"Oh, there's no use givin' in to 'em," interrupted Abe. "If you give
'em half a loaf, they want two. Th' only way is t' be firm. I'll
tell 'em we can't accommodate 'em."

Thereupon he began once more to talk to the Indians in their own
tongue. His words were at first received in silence, and then angry
cries came from the natives. The chief made a gesture of protest.

"Well, if you don't like it, you know what you kin do!" declared
Abe. "We've got th' best part of our journey before us, an' we can't
give away our supplies. Go hunt food if you want it, ye lazy
beggars!"

The peaceful demeanor of the Indians now turned to rage. The leader
dropped the rag that had served for a flag of truce, and took back
his gun.

"Look out! There's going to be trouble!" cried Tom.

"Well, we're ready for 'em!" answered Abe, grimly.

There was a moment of hesitation among the natives. Then they seemed
to hold a consultation with the chief. It was over shortly. They
broke into a run, and quickly advanced toward the cave. Tom and the
others held their guns in readiness.

Suddenly the Indians halted. They gazed upward, and pointed to
something in the air above their heads. They gave utterance to cries
of fear.

"What is it; another storm coming?" asked Tom.

"Let's look," suggested Ned. He and Tom stepped to the mouth of the
cave--they went outside. There was little danger from the natives
now, as their attention was fixed on something else.

A moment later Tom and Ned saw what this was.

Floating in the air, almost over the cave, was a great airship--a
large craft, nearly the size of the RED CLOUD. Hardly able to
believe the evidence of their eyes, Tom and Ned watched it. Whence
had it come? Whither was it going?

"It's a triplane!" murmured Ned.

"A triplane!" repeated Tom. "Yes--it is--and it's the airship of
Andy Foger! Our rivals are on our track!"

He continued to gaze upward as the triplane shot forward, the noise
of the motor being plainly heard. Then, with howls of fear, the
Indians turned and fled. The rival airship had vanquished them.




CHAPTER XV

THE RACE


Astonished and terrified as the Indians had been at the sight of the
big-winged craft, high in the air above their heads, Tom and the
others were no less surprised, though, of course, their fear was not
exactly the same as that of the Alaskan natives.

"Do you really think that is Andy Foger?" asked Ned, as they watched
the progress of the triplane.

"I'm almost sure of it," replied Tom. "That craft is built exactly
as his was, but I never expected him to have such good luck sailing
it."

"It isn't going very fast," objected Ned.

"No, but it can navigate pretty well, and that's something. He must
have hustled to get it together and reach this point with it."

"Yes, but he didn't have to travel as far as we did," went on Ned.
"He put his ship together at Sitka, and we came from Seattle."

"Bless my memoranda book!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "The Fogers here!
What's to be done about it?"

"Nothing, I guess," answered Tom. "I'd just as soon they wouldn't
see us. I don't believe they will. Get back into the cave. We must
use strategy now to get ahead of them. There will be a race to the
valley of gold."

"Well, he served us one good turn, anyhow, though he didn't mean
to," put in Abe Abercrombie.

"How?" asked Mr. Parker, who was still examining his gun, as though
trying to understand it.

"He scared away them pesky natives," went on the miner. "Otherwise
we might have had a fight, an' while I reckon we could have beat
'em, it's best not to fight if you kin git out of it."

The gold-seekers had withdrawn inside the mouth of the cave, where
they could watch the progress of the rival airship without being
seen. The Indians had disappeared beyond a snow-covered hill.

The airship of Andy Foger, for such it subsequently proved to be,
floated slowly onward. Its progress was not marked with the speed of
Tom's craft, though whether or not the occupants of the ANTHONY (as
Andy had vain-gloriously named his craft after himself) were
speeding up their motor, was a matter of conjecture.

The adventurers held a short consultation, while standing at the
mouth of the cave watching the progress of the ANTHONY. It rose in
the air, and circled about.

"He certainly IS trying to pick us up," declared Ned.

"Well, we'll start out after him to-morrow," decided Tom. "I think
all the patches will hold then."

They resumed work on the RED CLOUD, and that night Tom announced
that they would start in the morning. Meanwhile Andy's craft had
disappeared from sight. There was no further evidence of the
Indians.

"I don't reckon they'll come back," spoke Abe, grimly. "They think
we are sure-enough spirits, now, able to call creatures out of the
air whenever we want 'em. But still we must be on our guard."

As Mr. Parker was not of much service in helping on the airship he
agreed to be a sort of guard and took his place just outside the
cave, where he could make "observations," and, at the same time
watch for the reappearance of Indians. They had little fear of an
attack at night, for Abe said the Alaskans were not fond of
darkness.

The cold seemed to increase, and, even in the sheltered cave the
adventurers felt it. There were several heavy flurries of snow that
afternoon, and winter seemed setting in with a vengeance. The
daylight, too, was not of long duration, for the sun was well south
now, and in the far polar regions it was perpetual night.

After a brief inspection of the ship the next morning, following a
good night's rest, when they were not disturbed by any visits from
the natives, Tom announced that they would set sail. The day was a
clear one, but very cold, and the gold-seekers were glad of the
shelter of the warm cabin.

The RED CLOUD was wheeled from the cave, and set on a level place.
There was not room enough to make a flying start, and ascend by
means of the planes and propellers, so the gas-bag method was used.
The generating machine was put in operation, and soon the big red
bag that hovered over the craft began to fill. Tom was glad to see
that none of the several compartments leaked. The bag had been well
repaired.

Suddenly the RED CLOUD shot up in the air. Up above the towering
snow-covered crags it mounted, and then, with a whizz and a roar,
the propellers were set going.

"Once more northward bound!" cried Tom, as he took his place in the
pilothouse.

"And we'll see if we can beat Andy Foger there," added Ned.

All that morning the RED CLOUD shot ahead at good speed. The craft
had suffered no permanent damage during her fight with the hail
storm, and was as good as ever. They ate dinner high in the air,
while sailing over a great stretch of whiteness, where the snow lay
many feet deep on the level, and where great mountain crags were so
covered with the glistening mantle and a coating of ice as to
resemble the great bergs that float in the polar sea.

"I wouldn't want to be wrecked here," said Ned, with a shudder, as
he looked down. "We'd never get away. Does any one live down there,
Abe?"

"Yes, there are scattered tribes of Indians and Alaskan natives.
They live by hunting and fishing, and travel around by means of dog
sledges. But it's a dreary life. Me an' my partner had all we wanted
of it. An airship for mine!"

"I wonder what's become of Andy?" spoke Tom, that afternoon. "I
haven't sighted him, and I've been using the powerful telescope. I
can't pick him up, though he can't be so very far ahead of us."

"Let me try," suggested Ned. "Put her up a bit, Tom, where I can
look down. Andy won't dare go very high. Maybe I can sight him."

The RED CLOUD shot upward as the young inventor shifted the
elevation rudder, and the bank clerk, with the powerful glass to his
eye, swept the space below him. For half an hour he looked in vain.
Then, with a little start of surprise he handed the glass to his
chum.

"See what you make that out to be," suggested Ned. "It looks like a
big bird, yet I haven't seen any other birds to-day."

Tom looked. He peered earnestly through the telescope for a minute,
and then cried:

"It's Andy's airship! He's ahead of us! We must catch him! Ned, you
and Mr. Damon speed up the motor! The race is on!"

In a few minutes the great airship was hurling herself through
space, and, in less than ten minutes Andy's craft could be made out
plainly with the naked eye. Fifteen minutes more and the RED CLOUD
was almost up to her. Then those aboard the ANTHONY must have caught
sight of their pursuers, for there was a sudden increase in speed on
the part of the unscrupulous Foger crowd, who sought to steal a
march on Tom and his friends.

"The race is on!" repeated the young inventor grimly, as he pulled
the speed lever over another notch.




CHAPTER XVI

THE FALL OF THE ANTHONY


Had it not been for what was at stake, the race between the two big
airships would have been an inspiring one to those aboard Tom's
craft. As it was they were too anxious to overcome the unfair
advantage taken by Andy to look for any of the finer points in the
contest of the air.

"There's no denying that he's got a pretty good craft there,"
conceded Tom, as he watched the progress of his rival. "I never
thought Andy Foger could have done it."

"He didn't do very much of it," declared Ned. "He hired the best
part of that made. Andy hasn't any inventive ideas. He probably said
he wanted an airship, and his dad put up the money and hired men to
build it for him. Andy, Sam and Pete only tinkered around on it."

Later Tom and his chum learned that this was so--that Mr. Foger had
engaged the services of an expert to make the airship. This man had
been taken to Sitka with the Fogers, and had materially aided them
in re-assembling the craft.

"Do you think he can beat us?" asked Ned, anxiously.

"No!" exclaimed Tom, confidently. "There's only one craft that can
beat my RED CLOUD and that's my monoplane the BUTTERFLY. But I have
in mind plans for a speedier machine than even the monoplane.
However I haven't any fear that Andy can keep up to us in this
craft. I haven't begun to fly yet, and I'm pretty sure, from the way
his is going, that he has used his limit of speed."

"Then why don't you get ahead of him?" asked Mr. Damon. "Bless my
tape-measure! the way to win a race is to beat."

"Not this kind of a race," and the young inventor spoke seriously.
"If I got ahead of Andy now, he'd simply trail along and follow us.
That's his game. He wants me to be the path-finder, for, since I
cast a doubt on the correctness of the map, a copy of which he
stole, he isn't sure where he's going. He'd ask nothing better than
to follow us."

"Then what are you going to do if you don't get ahead of him?" asked
Ned.

"I'm going to press him close until night," answered Tom, "and when
it's dark, I'm going to shoot ahead, and, by morning we'll be so far
away that he can't catch up to us."

"Good idea! That's th' stuff!" cried Abe with enthusiasm.

"He's a sneak!" burst out Mr. Damon. "I'd like to see him left
behind."

Tom carried out his plan. The remainder of the day he hung just on
Andy's flank, sometimes shooting high up, almost out of sight, and
again coming down, just to show what the RED CLOUD could do when
pressed.

As for those aboard the ANTHONY, they seemed to be trying to
increase their speed, but, if that was their object they did not
have much success, for the big, clumsy triplane only labored along.

"I wonder who he's got with him?" said Ned, as darkness was closing
down. "I can't make out any one by this glass. They stick pretty
closely to the cabin."

"Oh, probably Andy's father is there," said "and, perhaps, some of
Mr. Foger's acquaintances. I guess Mr. Foger is as anxious to get
this gold as Andy is."

"He certainly needs money," admitted Ned. "Jove! but I hope we beat
him!"

But alas for Tom's hopes! His plan of waiting until night and then
putting on such speed as would leave Andy behind could not be
carried out. It was tried, but something went wrong with the main
motor, and only half power could be developed. Tom and Ned labored
over it nearly all night, to no effect, and through the hours of
darkness they could see the lights from the cabin of the ANTHONY
gleaming just ahead of them. Evidently the bully's airship could not
make enough speed to run away from the RED CLOUD, or else it was the
plan of the Foger crowd to keep in Tom's vicinity.

The direction held by Andy's craft was a general northwestern one,
and Tom knew, in time, and that very soon, it would bring the
ANTHONY over the valley of gold. Evidently Andy was placing some
faith in his copy of the stolen map.

"Once I get this motor in shape I'll soon pull away from him,"
announced Tom, about four o'clock that morning, while he and Ned,
aided by Mr. Damon, were still laboring over the refractory machine.

"What are you going to do?" asked Ned.

"It's too late to carry out my original plan," went on Tom. "We're
getting so near the place now that I want to be there ahead of every
one else. So as soon as we can, I'm going to push the RED CLOUD for
all she's worth, and get to the valley of gold first. If possession
is nine points of the law, I want those nine points."

"That's the way to talk!" cried Abe. "Once we git on th' ground we
kin hold our own!"

It was breakfast time before Tom had the motor repaired, and he
decided to have a good meal before starting to speed up his craft.
He felt better after some hot coffee, for he and the others were
weary from their night of labor.

"Now for the test!" he cried, as he went back to the engine-room.
"Here's where we give Andy the go-by, and I don't think he can catch
us!"

There was an increasing hum to the powerful motor, the great
propellers whirled around at twice their former number of
revolutions, and the airship suddenly shot ahead.

Those on the ANTHOMY must have been watching for some such move as
that, for, no sooner had Tom's craft begun to creep up on his rival
than the forward craft also shot ahead.

But the airship was not built that could compete with Tom's. Like a
racer overhauling a cart-horse, the RED CLOUD whizzed through the
air. In a spirit of fun the young inventor sent his machine within a
few feet of Andy's. He had a double purpose in this, for he wanted
to show the bully that he did not fear him, and he wanted to see if
he could discover who was aboard.

Tom did catch a glimpse of Andy and his father in the cabin of the
ANTHONY, and he also saw a couple of men working frantically over
the machinery.

"They're going to try to catch us!" called Tom to Ned.

This was evident a moment later, for, after the RED CLOUD had forged
ahead, her rival made a clumsy attempt to follow. The ANTHONY did
show a burst of speed, and, for a moment Tom was apprehensive lest
he had underrated his rival's prowess.

Suddenly Ned, who was looking from a projecting side window of the
pilothouse, back toward Andy's ship, cried out in alarm.

"What's the matter?" shouted Tom.

"The airship--Andy's--two of the main wings have collapsed!"

Tom looked. It was but too true. The strain under which the ANTHONY
had been put when the machinists increased the speed, had been too
much for the frame. Two wings broke, and now hung uselessly down,
one on either side. The ANTHONY shot toward the snow-covered earth!

"They're falling!" cried Mr. Parker.

"Yes," added Tom, grimly, "the race is over as far as they are
concerned."

"Bless my soul! Won't they be killed?" cried Mr. Damon.

"There's not much danger," replied the young inventor. "They can
vol-plane back to earth. That's what they're doing," he added a
moment later, as he witnessed the maneuver of the crippled craft.
"They're in no danger, but I don't believe they'll get to the valley
of gold this trip!"

Tom was soon to learn how easily he could be mistaken.




CHAPTER  XVII

HITTING THE ICE MOUNTAIN


Onward sped the RED CLOUD. For a moment after the accident to Andy's
ship, Tom had slowed up his craft, but he soon went on again, after
he had satisfied himself that his enemies were in no danger.

"Don't you think--that is to say--I know they can't expect anything
from us," spoke Mr. Damon, "but for humanity's sake, hadn't we
better stop and help them, Tom?"

"I hardly think so," replied the young inventor. "In the first place
they would hardly thank us for doing so, and, in the second, I don't
believe they need help. They are almost safely down now."

"I don't just mean that," went on the odd man. "But they may starve
to death. This is a very desolate country over which we are
sailing."

"They must have a supply of food in their ship," declared Tom, "and
they have brought their plight on themselves."

"They're in no great danger," put in Abe.

"There are plenty of natives around here, an' if the Fogers need
food or aid they can git it by payin' for it. Why, for the sake of
th' parts of their damaged airship, th' Eskimos would take th' whole
party back t' Sitka and feed 'em well on th' trip. Oh, they're all
right."

"Very well, if you say so," assented Mr. Damon. He looked back to
watch the ANTHONY slowly settling to earth. It came gently down,
proving that Tom knew whereof he spoke, when he had said they could
vol-plane down. Before the RED CLOUD was out of sight Tom and his
companions saw Andy and his father leave their wrecked craft and
venture out on the snow-covered ground. The Fogers gazed enviously
after the airship of our hero as they saw him still forging toward
the goal.

"I guess Andy's stolen map won't be of much use to him," mused Tom.
"Now we can put on all the speed we like," and with that he shifted
the gears and levers until the airship was making exceedingly good
time toward the valley of gold.

The remainder of that day saw our adventurers pursuing their way
eagerly. At times they were flying high, and again, when Abe
suggested that they go down to observe the character of the country
over which they were passing, they skimmed along, just above the big
mountains, which seemed almost like icebergs, so covered were they
with frost and snow.

They were indeed in a wild and desolate country. Below them
stretched a seemingly endless waste of snow and ice--great forests
interspersed with treeless patches, while now and then they sailed
over a frozen lake.

Once in a while they had glimpses of bands of Indians, dressed in
furs, hunting. At such times the natives would look up, on hearing
the noise made by the motor of the airship, and catching a glimpse
of what must have seemed to them like some supernatural object, they
would fall down prostrate in amazement and fear.

"Airships are pretty much of a novelty up here," remarked Abe with a
grim smile.

The weather was now very cold, and the gold-seekers had to get out
their heavy fur garments, of which they had brought along a goodly
supply. True, it was warm in the cabin of the airship, but at times,
they wanted to venture out on the deck to get fresh air, or to make
some adjustments to the wing planes, and, on such occasions the
keen, frosty air, as it was driven past them by the motion of the
craft, made even the thickest garments seem none too warm. Then,
too, it was colder at the elevation at which they flew than down on
the ground.

Another day found them in a still wilder and more desolate part of
Alaska. There were scarcely any signs of habitation now, and the
snow and ice seemed so thick that even a long summer of sunshine
could hardly have melted it. The hours of daylight, too, were
growing less and less the farther north they went.

"Do you think you can pilot us right to the Snow Mountains, Abe?"
asked Tom, on the third day after the accident to Andy's airship.
"Let's get out the map, and have another look at it. We must be
getting near the place now. We'll look at the map."

The young inventor went to his stateroom where he kept the important
document in a small desk, and the others heard him rummaging around.
He muttered impatiently, and Ned heard his chum say: "I thought sure
I put it in here." Then ensued a further search, and presently Tom
came out, his face wearing rather a puzzled and worried look, and he
asked: "Say, Abe, I didn't give that map back to you; did I?"

"Nope," answered the miner. "I ain't seen it since just before th'
hail storm. We was lookin' at it then."

"That's when I remember it," went on Tom, "and I thought I put it in
my desk. I didn't, by any possible chance give it to you; did I,
Ned?"

"Me? No, I haven't seen it."

"That's funny," went on Tom. "I'll look once more. Maybe it got
under some papers."

They heard him rummaging again in his desk.

"Bless my bank-book!" cried Mr. Damon. "I hope nothing has happened
to that map. We can't find the valley of gold without it."

Tom came back again.

"I can't find it." he said, hopelessly.

Then ensued a frantic search. Every possible place in the airship
was looked into, but the precious map did not turn up.

"Perhaps the Fogers took it," suggested Mr. Parker, who had helped
in the hunt, in a dreamy sort of fashion.

"That's not possible," said Tom. "They haven't been near enough to
us since I saw the map last. No, the last time I had it was just
before the hail storm, and, in the excitement of repairing the ship,
I have mislaid it."

"Maybe it's back there in the big cave," suggested Ned.

"It's possible," admitted the young inventor. "Pshaw! It's very
careless of me!"

"If you think it's in the cave, we'd better go back there and have a
hunt for it," suggested Mr. Damon. "Otherwise we are on a wild-goose
chase."

"Don't go back!" exclaimed old Abe. "I think we can find th' valley
of gold without th' map, now that we have come this far. I sort of
remember th' marks on that parchment, an' we are in the right
neighborhood now, for I kin see some of th' landmarks my partner and
I saw. I say, let's keep on! We can cruise around a bit until we
strike th' right place. That won't take us so long as it would to go
back to the cave. Besides, if we go back, the Fogers may get ahead
of us!"

"With their broken airship?" asked Ned.

"Can't they repair it?" demanded Abe.

"Hardly--up in this wild country," was Tom's opinion. "But perhaps
it WILL be just as well to keep on. I have a hazy remembrance of the
distances and directions on the map, and, though it will take longer
to hunt out the valley this way, I think we can do it. I can't
forgive myself for my carelessness! I should have kept a copy of the
map, or given one of you folks one."

But they would not hear of him blaming himself, and said it might
have happened to any one. It was decided that the map must be lost
in the big cave, and if it was there it was not likely to be found
by their enemies.

"We'll jest have t' prospect about a bit," declared Abe, "only we'll
do it in th' air instead of on th' ground."

It was dusk when the fruitless search for the map was over, and they
sat in the cabin discussing matters. The lights had not yet been
switched on, and the RED CLOUD was skimming along under the
influence of the automatic rudders and the propellers.

"Well, suppose we have supper," proposed Mr. Damon, who seemed to
think eating a remedy for many ills, mental and bodily. "Bless my
desert-spoon, but I'm hungry!"

He started toward the galley, while Tom went forward to the
pilothouse. Hardly had he reached it than there came a terrific
crash, and the airship seemed tossed back by some giant hand. Every
one was thrown off his feet, and the lights which had been turned on
suddenly went out.

"What's the matter?" cried Ned.

"Have we hit anything?" demanded Mr. Damon.

"Hit anything! I should say we had!" yelled Tom. "We've knocked a
piece off a big mountain of ice!"

As he spoke the airship began slowly settling toward the earth, for
her machinery had been stopped by the terrific impact.




CHAPTER XVIII

A FIGHT WITH MUSK OXEN


"Can I help you, Tom? What's to be done?" demanded Ned Newton, as he
rushed to where his chum was yanking on various levers and gear
wheels.

"Wait a minute!" gasped the young inventor. "I want to throw on the
storage battery, and that will give us some light. Then we can see
what we are doing." An instant later the whole ship was illuminated,
and those aboard her felt calmer. Still the RED CLOUD continued to
sink.

"Can't we do something?" yelled Ned. "Start the propellers, Tom!"

"No, I'll use the gas. I can't see where we're heading for, as the
searchlight is out of business. We may be in the midst of a lot of
bergs. We were flying too low. Just start the gas generating
machine."

Ned hurried to obey this order. He saw Tom's object. With the big
bag full of gas the airship would settle gently to earth as easily
as though under the command of the propellers and wing planes.

In a few minutes the hissing of the machine told that the vapor was
being forced into the bag and a little later the downward motion of
the ship was checked. She moved more and more slowly toward the
earth, until, with a little jar, she settled down, and came to rest.
But she was on such an uneven keel that the cabin was tilted at an
unpleasant angle.

"Bless my salt-cellar!" cried Mr. Damon. "We are almost standing on
our heads!"

"Better that than not standing at all," replied Tom, grimly. "Now to
see what the damage is."

He scrambled from the forward door of the cabin, no easy task
considering how it was tilted, and the others followed him. It was
too dark to note just how much damage had been inflicted, but Tom
was relieved to see, as nearly as he could judge, that it was
confined to the forward part of the front platform or deck of the
ship. The wooden planking was split, but the extent of the break
could not be ascertained until daylight. The searchlight connections
had been broken by the collision, and it could not be used.

"Now to take a look at the machinery," suggested the young inventor,
when he had walked around his craft. "That is what I am worried
about more than about the outside."

But, to their joy, they found only a small break in the motor. That
was what caused it to stop, and also put the dynamo out of
commission.

"We can easily fix that," Tom declared.

"Bless my coffee-spoon!" cried Mr. Damon, who seemed to be running
to table accessories in his blessings. Perhaps it was because it was
so near supper time. "Bless my coffee-spoon! But how did it happen?"

"We were running too low," declared Tom. "I had forgotten that we
were likely to get among tall mountain peaks at any moment, and I
set the elevation rudder too low. It was my fault. I should have
been on the lookout. We must have struck the mountain of ice a
glancing blow, or the result would have been worse than it is. We'll
come out of it all right, as it is."

"We can't do anything to-night," observed Ned.

"Only eat," put in Mr. Damon, "and we'll have to take our coffee
cups half full, for everything is so tilted that it's like topsy-turvey
land. It makes me fairly dizzy!"

But he forgot this in the work of getting a meal, and, though it was
prepared under considerable difficulties, at last it was ready.

Bright and early the next morning Tom was up making another
inspection of his ship. He found that even if the forward deck was
not repaired they could go on, as soon as the motor was in shape,
but, as they had some spare wood aboard, it was decided to
temporarily repair the smashed platform.

It was cold work, even wearing their thick garments; but, after
laboring until their fingers were stiff from the frost, Ned hit on
the idea of building a big fire of some evergreen trees near where
the ship lay.

"Say, that's all right!" declared Tom, as the warmth of the blaze
made itself felt. "We can work better, now!"

The RED CLOUD was tilted on some rough and uneven ground, in among
some little hills. On either side arose big peaks, the one in
particular that they had hit towering nearly fifteen thousand feet.

Everything was covered with snow and ice, and, in fact, the ice was
so thick on the top of the mountains that the crags resembled
icebergs rather than stony peaks. The crash of the airship had
brought down a great section of this solid rock-ice.

"Do you think we are anywhere near the valley of gold?" asked Mr.
Damon that afternoon, when the work was nearly finished.

"It's somewhere in this vicinity." declared Abe. "Me an' my partner
passed through jest such a place as this on our way there. I
wouldn't wonder but what it wasn't more than a few hundred miles
away, now."

"Then we'll soon be there," said Tom. "I'll start in the morning. I
could go to-night, but there are a few adjustments I want to make to
the motor, and, besides, I think it will be safer, now that we are
among these peaks, to navigate in daylight, or at least with the
searchlight going. I should have thought of that before."

"Then, if you're not going to start away at once," spoke Mr. Parker,
"I think I will walk around a bit, and make some observations. I
think we are now in the region where we may expect a movement of the
ice. I want to test it, and see if it is traveling in a southerly
direction. If it is not now, it will soon be doing that, and the
coating of ice may reach even as far as New York."

"Pleasant prospect," murmured Tom. Then he said aloud: "Well if you
are going, Mr. Parker, we'll be with you. I'll be glad of the chance
to stretch my legs, and what more remains to be done, can be
finished in the morning."

Mr. Damon declared that he did not relish a tramp over the ice and
snow, and would stay in the warm cabin, but Tom and Ned, with Abe
and Mr. Parker started off. The scientist pointed out what he
claimed were evidences of the impending movement of the ice, while
Abe explained to the lads how the Alaskan Indians of that
neighborhood hunted and fished, and how they made huts of blocks of
ice.

"We are nearing th' Arctic circle," the old miner said, "and we'll
soon be among th' most savage of the Eskimo tribes."

"Is there any hunting around here?" asked Ned.

"Yes, plenty of musk ox," answered Abe.

"I wish I'd brought my gun along and could see one of the big beasts
now," went on Ned. He looked anxiously around, but no game was in
sight. After a little farther tramp over the icy expanse they all
declared that they had seen enough of the dreary landscape, and
voted to return to the ship.

As they neared their craft Tom saw several large, shaggy black
objects standing in a line on the path the adventurers had come over
a little while before. The objects were between the gold-seekers and
the RED CLOUD.

"What in the world are those?" asked the young inventor.

"Look to me like black stones," spoke Ned.

"Stones?" cried Abe. "Look out, boys, those are musk oxen; and big
ones, too! There's a lot of 'em! Make for the ship! If they attack
us we're goners!"

The boys and Mr. Parker needed no second warning. Turning so as to
rush past the shaggy creatures, the four headed toward the ship.

But if our friends expected to reach it unmolested they were
disappointed. No sooner had they increased their pace than the oxen,
with snorts of rage, darted forward. The animals may have imagined
they were about to be attacked, and determined to make the first
move.

"Here they come!" yelled Ned.

"Sprint for it!" cried Tom.

"Oh, if I only had my gun!" groaned Abe.

It was hard work running over the ice and snow, hampered as they
were with their heavy fur garments. They soon realized this, and the
pace was telling on them. They were now near to the ship, but the
savage creatures still were between them and the craft.

"Try around the other way!" directed Tom, They changed their
direction, but the oxen also shifted their ground, and with loud
bellows of rage came on, shaking their shaggy heads and big horns,
while the hair, hanging down from their sides and flanks, dragged in
the snow.

"Right at 'em! Run and yell!" advised the young inventor. "Maybe we
can scare 'em!"

They followed his advice. Yelling like Indians the four rushed
straight for the animals. For a moment only the creatures halted.
Then, bellowing louder than ever they rushed straight at Tom and the
others.

The largest of the oxen, with a sudden swerve, made for Mr. Parker,
who was slightly in the lead off to one side. In an instant the
scientist was tossed high in the air, falling in a snow bank.

"Mr. Damon! Mr. Damon!" yelled Tom, frantically. "Get a gun and
shoot these beasts!"

The young inventor and his two companions had come to a halt. The
oxen also stopped momentarily. Suddenly Mr. Damon appeared on the
deck of the airship. He held two rifles. Laying one down he aimed
the other at the ox which was rushing at the prostrate Mr. Parker.
The eccentric man fired. He hit the beast on the flank, and, with a
bellow of rage it turned.

"Now's our time!" yelled Tom. "Head for the ship, I'll get my
electric gun!"

"We can't leave Mr. Parker!" yelled Abe.

But the scientist had arisen, and was running toward the RED CLOUD.
He did not seem to be much hurt. Mr. Damon fired again, hitting
another beast, but not mortally.

Once more the herd of shaggy creatures came on, but the adventurers
were now almost at the ship, on the deck of which stood Mr. Damon,
firing as fast as he could work the lever and pull the trigger.




CHAPTER XIX

THE CAVES OF ICE


"Keep on firing! Hold 'em back a few minutes and I'll soon turn my
electric rifle loose on 'em!" yelled Tom Swift as he sprinted
forward. "Keep on shooting, Mr. Damon!"

"Bless my powder-horn! I will!" cried the excited man. "I'll fire
all the cartridges there are in the rifle!"

Which, at the rate he was discharging the weapon, would not take a
long time. But it had the effect of momentarily checking the advance
of the creatures.

Not for long, however. Our friends had barely reached the airship,
with Mr. Parker stumbling and slipping on the ice and snow, ere the
musk oxen came on again, with loud bellows.

"They're going to charge the ship! They'll ram her!" yelled Ned
Newton.

"I think I can stop them!" cried Tom, who had leaped toward his
stateroom. He came out a moment later, carrying a peculiar-looking
gun, The adventurers had seen it before, but never in operation, as
Tom had only put some finishing touches on it since undertaking the
voyage to the caves of ice.

"What sort of a weapon is that?" cried Abe, as he helped Mr. Parker
on board.

"It's my new electric rifle," answered the young inventor. "I don't
know how it will work, as it isn't entirely finished, but I'm going
to try it."

Putting it to his shoulder he aimed at the leading musk ox, and
pulled a small lever. There was no report, no puff of smoke and no
fire, yet the big creature, which had been rushing at the ship,
suddenly stopped, swayed for a moment, and then fell over in the
snow, kicking in his death agony.

"One down!" yelled Tom. "My rifle works all right, even if it isn't
finished!"

He aimed at another ox, and that creature was stopped in its tracks.
Mr. Damon had exhausted his cartridges, and had ceased firing, but
Abe Abercrombie was ready with his rifle, and opened up on the
beasts. Tom killed another with his electric gun, and Abe shot two.
This stopped the advance, and only just in time, for the foremost
animals were already close to the ship, and had they rushed at the
frail hull they might have damaged it beyond repair.

"Here goes for the big one!" cried Tom, and, aiming at the largest
ox of the herd, the young inventor pulled the lever. The brute fell
over dead, and the rest, terror stricken, turned and fled.

"Hurrah! That's the stuff!" cried Ned Newton, capering about on
deck. He had hurried to his stateroom and secured his rifle, and,
before the musk oxen were out of sight he had killed one, which gave
him great delight.

"Mighty lucky we drove them away," declared Abe. "They are terrible
savage at times, an' I reckon we struck one of them times. But say,
Tom, what sort of a gun is that you got, anyhow?"

"Oh, it fires electric bullets," explained our hero. "But I haven't
time to tell you about it now. Let's get out and skin one of those
oxen. The fresh meat will come in good, for we've been living on
canned stuff since we left Seattle. We've got time enough before it
gets dark."

They hurried to where the shaggy creatures lay in the snow, and soon
there was enough fresh meat to last a long time, as it would keep
well in the intense cold. Tom put away his electric gun, briefly
explaining the system of it to his companions. The time was to come,
and that not very far off, when that same electric rifle was to save
his life in a remarkable manner, in the wilds of Africa where he
went to hunt elephants.

In the cozy cabin that night they sat and talked of the day's
adventures. The airship had been slightly lifted up by means of the
gas bag, and now rested on a level keel, so it was more comfortable
for the gold hunters.

"I did not complete my observations about the great snow slide,"
remarked Professor Parker, "I trust I will have time to go over the
ground again to-morrow."

"We leave early in the morning," objected Tom.

"Besides, I don't believe it would be safe to go over that ground
again," put in Mr. Damon.

"Bless my gunpowder! But when I saw those savage creatures rushing
at you, I thought it was all up with us. Are you hurt, Parker, my
dear fellow? I forgot to ask before."

"Not hurt in the least," answered the scientist. "My heavy and thick
fur garments saved me from the beasts' horns, and I fell in some
soft snow. I was quite startled for a moment. I thought it might be
the beginning of the snow movement."

"It was an ox movement," said Ned, in a low voice to Tom.

Morning saw the travelers again under way, with the Red Cloud now
floating high enough to avoid the lofty peaks. The weather was clear
but very cold, and Tom, who was in the pilot-house, could see a long
distance ahead, and note many towering crags, which, had the airship
been flying low enough, would have interfered with her progress.

"We'll have to keep the searchlight going all night, to avoid a
collision," he decided.

"Are we anywhere near the place?" asked Mr. Damon.

"We're in th' right region," declared the old miner. "I think we're
on th' right track. I recognize a few more landmarks."

"There wouldn't have been any trouble if I hadn't lost the map."
complained Tom, bitterly.

"Never mind about that," insisted Abe. "We'll find th' place anyhow.
But look ahead there; is that another hail storm headin' this way,
Tom?"

The young inventor glanced to where Abe pointed. There was a mist in
the air, and, for a time great apprehension was felt, but, in a few
minutes there was a violent flurry of snow and they all breathed
easier. For, though the flakes were so numerous as to completely
shut off the view, there was no danger to the airship from them. Tom
steered by the compass.

The storm lasted several hours, and when it was over the adventurers
found themselves several miles nearer their destination--at least
they hoped they were nearer it, for they were going it blind.

Abe declared they were now in the region of the gold valley. They
cruised about for two days, making vain observations by means of
powerful telescopes, but they saw no signs of any depression which
corresponded with the place whence Abe had seen the gold taken from.
At times they passed over Indian villages, and had glimpses of the
skin-clad inhabitants rushing out to point to the strange sight of
the airship overhead. Tom was beginning to reproach himself again
for his carelessness in losing the map, and it did begin to took as
if they were making a fruitless search.

Still they all kept up their good spirits, and Mr. Damon concocted
some new dishes from the meat of the musk oxen. It was about a week
after the fight with the savage creatures when, one day, as Ned was
on duty in the pilothouse, he happened to look down. What he saw
caused him to call to Tom.

"What's the matter?" demanded the young inventor, as he hurried
forward.

"Look down there," directed Ned. "It looks as if we were sailing
over a lot of immense beehives of the old-fashioned kind."

Tom looked. Below were countless, rounded hummocks of snow or ice.
Some were very large--as immense as a great shed in which a
dirigible balloon could be housed--while others were as small as the
ice huts in which the Eskimos live.

"That's rather strange," remarked Tom. "I wonder--"

But he did not complete his sentence, for Abe Abercrombie, who had
come to stand beside him, suddenly yelled out:

"The caves of ice! The caves of ice! Now I know where we are! We're
close to the valley of gold! There are the caves of ice, and just
beyond is th' place we're lookin' for! We've found it at last!"




CHAPTER XX

IN THE GOLD VALLEY


The excited cries of the old miner brought Mr. Damon and Mr. Parker
to the pilothouse on the run.

"Bless my refrigerator!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Are there more of
those savage, shaggy creatures down there?"

"No, but we are over th' caves of ice," explained Abe. "That means
we are near th' gold."

"You don't say so!" burst out the scientist. "The caves of ice! Now
I can begin my real observations! I have a theory that the caves are
on top of a strata of ice that is slowly moving down, and will
eventually bury the whole of the North American continent. Let me
once get down there, and I can prove what I say."

"I'd a good deal rather you wouldn't prove it, if it's going to be
anything like it was on Earthquake Island, or out among the diamond
makers." said Tom Swift. "But we will go down there, to see what
they are like. Perhaps there is a trail from among the ice caves to
the valley of gold."

"I don't think so," said Abe, shaking his head.

"I think th' gold valley lies over that high ridge," and he pointed
to one. "That's where me an' my partner was," he went on. "I
recognize th' place now."

"Well, we'll go down here, anyhow," decided Tom, and he pulled the
lever to let some gas out of the bag, and tilted the deflection
rudder to send the airship toward the odd caves.

And, curious enough did our friends find them when they had made a
landing and got out to walk about them. It was very cold, for on
every side was solid ice. They walked on ice, which was like a floor
beneath their feet, level save where the ice caves reared
themselves. As for the caverns, they, too, were hollowed out of the
solid ice. It was exactly as though there had once been a level
surface of some liquid. Then by some upheaval of nature, the surface
was blown into bubbles, some large and some small. Then the whole
thing had frozen solid, and the bubbles became hollow caves. In time
part of the sides fell in and made an opening, so that nearly all
the caves were capable of being entered.

This method of their formation was advanced as a theory by Mr.
Parker, and no one cared to dispute him. The gold-seekers walked
about, gazing on the ice caves with wonder showing on their faces.

It was almost like being in some fantastic scene from fairyland, the
big ice bubbles representing the houses, the roofs being rounded
like the igloos of the Eskimos. Some had no means of entrance, the
outer surface showing no break. Others had small openings, like a
little doorway, while of still others there remained but a small
part of the original cave, some force of nature having crumbled and
crushed it.

"Wonderful! Wonderful!" exclaimed Mr. Parker. "It bears out my
theory exactly! Now to see how fast the ice is moving."

"How are you going to tell?" asked Tom.

"By taking some mark on this field of ice, and observing a distant
peak. Then I will set up a stake, and by noting their relative
positions, I can tell just how fast the ice field is moving
southward." The scientist hurried into the ship to get a sharpened
stake he had prepared for this purpose.

"How fast do you think the ice is moving?" asked Ned.

"Oh, perhaps two or three feet a year." "Two or three feet a year?"
gasped Mr. Damon. "Why, Parker, my dear fellow, at that rate it will
be some time before the ice gets to New York."

"Oh, yes. I hardly expect it will reach there within two thousand
years, but my theory will be proved, just the same!"

"Humph!" exclaimed Abe Abercrombie, "I ain't goin' to worry any
more, if it's goin' t' take all that while. I reckoned, to hear him
talk, that it was goin' t' happen next summer."

"So did I," agreed Tom, but their remarks were lost on Mr. Parker
who was busy making observations. The young inventor and the others
walked about among the ice caves.

"Some of these caverns would be big enough to house the RED CLOUD in
case of another hail storm," observed Tom. "That one over there
would hold two craft the size of mine," and, in fact, probably three
could have gotten in if the opening had been somewhat enlarged, for
the ice cave to which our hero pointed was an immense one.

As the adventurers were walking about they were startled by a
terrific crashing sound. They started in alarm, for, off to their
left, the top of one of the ice caverns had crashed inward, the
blocks of frozen water crushing and grinding against one another.

"It's a good thing we weren't in there," remarked Tom, and he could
not repress a shudder, "There wouldn't have been much left of the
RED CLOUD if she had been inside."

It was a desolate place, in spite of the wild beauty of it, and
beautiful it was when the sun shone on the ice caves, making them
sparkle as if they were studded with diamonds. But it was cold and
cheerless, and there were no signs that human beings had ever been
there. Mr. Parker had completed the setting of his stake, and picked
out his landmarks, and was gravely making his "observations," and
jotting down some figures in a notebook.

"How fast is it moving, Parker?" called Mr. Damon.

"I can't tell yet," was the response. "It will require observations
extending over several days before I will know the rate."

"Then we might as well go on," suggested Tom. "There is nothing to
be gained from staying here, and I would like to get to the gold
valley. Abe says we are near it."

"Right over that ridge, I take it to be," replied the miner. "An' we
can't get there any too soon for me. Those Fogers may git their ship
fixed up, an' arrive before we do if we wait much longer."

"Not much danger, I guess," declared Ned.

"Well, we'll go up in the air, and see what we can find," decided
Tom, as he turned back toward the ship.

They found the "ridge" as Abe designated it, to be a great plateau,
over a hundred miles in extent, and they were the better part of
that day crossing it, for they went slowly, so as not to miss the
valley which the miner was positive was close at hand. Mr. Parker
disliked leaving the ice caves, but Abe said there were more in the
valley where they were going, and the scientist could renew his
observations.

It was getting dusk when Tom, who was peering through a powerful
glass, called out:

"Well, we're at the end of the plateau, and it seems to dip down
into a valley just beyond here."

"Then that's the place!" cried Abe, excitedly. "Go slow, Tom."

Our hero needed no such caution. Carefully he sent the airship
forward. A few minutes later they were passing over a large Eskimo
village, the fur-clad inhabitants of which rushed about wildly
excited at the sight of the airship.

"There they are! Them's th' beggars!" cried the old miner. "Them's
th' fellows who drove me an' my partner away. But there's th' valley
of gold! I know it now! Now t' fill our pockets with nuggets!"

"Are you sure this is the place?" asked Mr. Damon.

"Sartin sure of it!" declared Abe. "Put her down, Tom! Put her
down!"

"All right," agreed the young inventor, as he shifted the deflection
rudder. The airship began her descent into the valley. The edge of
the plateau, leading down into the great depression was now black
with the Eskimos and Indians, who were capering about, gesticulating
wildly.

"It's quite a surprise party to 'em," observed Ned Newton.

"Yes, I hope they don't spring one on us," added Tom.

Down and down went the RED CLOUD lower and lower into the valley.

"There are ice caves there!" cried Mr. Parker, pointing to the
curiously rounded and hollow hummocks. "Lots of them!"

"And larger than the others!" added Mr. Damon.

The airship was now moving slowly, for Tom wanted to pick out a good
landing place. He saw a smooth stretch of the ice just ahead of him,
in front of an immense ice cave.

"I'll make for that," he told Ned.

A few minutes later the craft had come to rest. Tom shut off the
power and hurried from the pilothouse, donning his fur coat as he
rushed out. A blast of frigid air met him as he opened the outer
door of the cabin. Back on the ridge of the plateau he could see the
fringe of Indians.

"Well, we're here in the valley," he said, as his friends gathered
about him on the icy ground.

"An' now for th' gold!" cried Abe, "for it's here that th' nuggets
are--enough for all of us! Come on an' have a hunt for 'em!"




CHAPTER XXI

THE FOGERS ARRIVE


In spite of the fact that he tried to remain calm, Tom Swift felt a
wild exultation as he thought of what lay before him and his
friends. To be in a place where gold could be picked up! where they
might all become fabulously wealthy! where the ground might be seen
covered with the precious yellow metal! this was enough to set the
nerves of any one a-tingle!

Tom could hardly realize it at first. After many hardships, no
little danger, and after an attempt on the part of their enemies to
defeat them, they had at last reached their goal. Now, as Abe had
said, they could hunt for the gold.

But if they expected to see the precious yellow nuggets lying about
ready to be picked up like so many kernels of corn, they were
disappointed. A quick look all about showed them only a vast extent
of ice and snow, broken here and there by the big caves of ice.
There were not so many of the latter as at the first place they
stopped, but the caverns were larger.

"Gold--I don't see any gold," remarked Ned Newton, with a
disappointed air. "Where is it?"

"Bless my pocketbook, yes! Where is it?" demanded Mr. Damon.

"Oh, we've got to dig for it," explained Abe. "It's only when
there's been a slight thaw that some of th' pebble nuggets kin be
seen. They're under th' ice, an' we've got t' dig for 'em."

"Does it ever thaw up here?" asked Mr. Parker. "The ice of the caves
seems thick enough to last forever."

"It does thaw an' melt some," went on the miner. "But some of th'
caves last all through what they call 'summer' up here, though it's
more like winter. We're above th' Arctic circle now, friends."

"Maybe we can keep on to the Pole," suggested Ned.

"Not this trip," spoke Tom, grimly. "We'll try for the gold, first."

"Yes, an' I'm goin' t' begin diggin' right away!" exclaimed Abe, as
he turned back into the airship, and came out again with a pick and
shovel, a supply of which implements had been brought along. The
others followed his example, and soon the ice chips were flying
about in a shower, while the sun shining on them gave the appearance
of a rainbow.

"Look at those Indians watching us," remarked Ned to Tom, as he
paused in his chipping of the frozen surface. The young inventor
glanced up toward the distant plateau where a fringe of dark figures
stood. The natives were evidently intently watching the gold-seekers.

"Do you think there's any danger from them. Abe?" asked Tom.

"Not much," was the reply. "They made trouble for me an' my partner,
but I guess th' airship has scared 'em sufficient, so they won't
come snoopin' down here," and Abe fell to at his digging again.

Mr. Damon was also vigorously wielding a pick, but Mr. Parker like
the true scientist he was, had renewed his observations. Evidently
the gold had no attractions for him, or, if it did, he preferred to
wait until he had finished his calculations.

Vigorously the adventurers wielded their implements, making the ice
fly, but for an hour or more no gold was discovered. Mr. Damon,
after picking lightly at a certain place, would get discouraged, and
move on to another. So did Ned, and Tom, after going down quite a
way, left off work, and walked over to one of the big ice caves.

"What's up?" asked Ned, resting from his labors.

"I was thinking whether it would be safe to put the RED CLOUD in
this ice cave for a shelter," replied Tom. "There may come up a hail
storm at any time, and damage it. The caves would be just the place
for it, only I'm afraid the roof might collapse."

"It looks strong," said Ned. "Let's ask Mr. Parker his opinion."

"Good idea," agreed Tom.

The scientist was soon taking measurements of the thickness of the
cave roof, noting its formation, and looking at the frozen floor.

"I see no reason why this cave should collapse," he finally
announced. "The only danger is the movement of the whole valley of
ice, and that is too gradual to cause any immediate harm. Yes, I
think the airship could be housed in the ice cave."

"Then I'll run her in, and she'll be safer," decided Tom. "I guess
we three can do it, Ned, and leave Mr. Damon and Abe to keep on
digging for gold." The airship was so buoyant that it could easily
be moved about on the bicycle wheels on which it rested, and soon,
after the lower edge of the opening into the ice cave had been
smoothed down, the RED CLOUD was placed in the novel shelter.

"Now to continue the search for the yellow nuggets!" cried Ned, and
Tom went with him, even Mr. Parker condescending to take a pick,
now. Abe was the only one who dug steadily in one place. The others
tried spot after spot.

"You've got t' stick t' one lead until you find somethin', or until
it peters out," explained the miner. "You must git down to th' dirt
before you'll find any gold, though you may strike a few grains that
have worked up into th' ice."

After this advice they all kept to one hole until they had worked
down through the ice to the dirt surface below. But even then, Abe,
who was the first to achieve this, found no gold, and the old miner
went to another location.

All the rest of that day they dug, but with no result. Not even a
few grains of yellow dust rewarded their efforts.

"Are you sure this is the right place?" asked Mr. Damon, somewhat
fretfully, of Abe, as they ate supper that night in the airship,
sheltered as it was in the ice cave.

"I'm positive of it," was the reply. "There's gold here, but it will
take some prospectin' t' find it. Maybe th' deposits have been
shifted by th' ice movement, as Mr. Parker says. But it's here, an'
we'll git it. We'll try ag'in t'-morrow."

They did try, but with small success. Laboring all day in the cold
the only result was a few little yellow pebbles that Tom found
imbedded in the ice. But they were gold, and the finding of them
gave the seekers hope as they wearily began their task the following
day. The weather seemed even colder, and there was the indication of
a big storm.

They were scattered in different places on the ice, not far away
from the big cave, each one picking away vigorously. Suddenly Abe,
who had laboriously worked his way down to the dirt, gave an
exultant yell.

"I've struck it! Struck it rich!" he shouted, leaping about as he
threw down his pick, "Look here, everybody!" He stooped down over
the hole. They all ran to his side, and saw him lifting from a
little pocket in the dirt, several large, yellow pebbles.

"Gold! Gold!" cried Abe. "We've struck it at last!"

For a moment no one spoke, though there was a wild beating of their
hearts. Then, off toward the farther end of the valley there sounded
a curious noise. It was a shouting and yelling, mingled with the
snapping of whips and the howls and barkings of dogs.

"Bless my handkerchief!" cried Mr. Damon. "What's that?"

They all saw a moment later. Approaching over the frozen snow were
several Eskimo sledges, drawn by dog teams, and the native drivers
were shouting and cracking their whips of walrus hide.

"The natives are coming to attack us!" cried Ned.

Tom said nothing. He was steadily observing the approaching sleds.
They came on rapidly. Abe was holding the golden nuggets in his
gloved hands.

"Get the guns! Where's your electric rifle, Tom?" cried Mr. Damon.

"I don't believe we'll need the guns--just yet," answered the young
inventor, slowly.

"Bless my cartridge-belt! Why not?" demanded the eccentric man.

"Because those are the Fogers," replied Tom. "They have followed
us--Andy and his father! Andy Foger here!" gasped Ned.

Tom nodded grimly. A few minutes later the sleds had come to a halt
not far from our friends, and Andy, followed by his father, leaped
off his conveyance. The two were clad in heavy fur garments.

"Ha, Tom Swift! You didn't get here much ahead of us!" exulted the
bully. "I told you I'd get even with you! Come on, now, dad, we'll
get right to work digging for gold!"

Tom and his companions did not know what to say.




CHAPTER XXII

JUMPING THE CLAIM


There was a sneering look on Andy's face, and Mr. Foger, too, seemed
delighted at having reached the valley of gold almost as soon as had
our friends. Tom and the others looked at the means by which the
bully had arrived. There were four sleds, each one drawn by seven
dogs, and in charge of a dark-skinned native. On the two foremost
sleds Andy and his father had ridden, while the other two evidently
contained their supplies.

For a moment Andy surveyed Tom's party and then, turning to one of
the native drivers, he said:

"We'll camp here. You fellows get to work and make an ice house, and
some of you cook a meal--I'm hungry."

"No need build ice house," replied the native, who spoke English
brokenly.

"Why not?" demanded Andy.

"Live in ice cave-plenty much ob'em--plenty much room," went on the
Eskimo, indicating several of the large caverns.

"Ha! That's a good idea," agreed Mr. Foger, "Andy, my son, we have
houses already made for us, and very comfortable they seem, too.
We'll take up our quarters in one, and then hunt for the gold."

Mr. Foger seemed to ignore Tom and his friends. Abe Abercrombie
strode forward.

"Look here, you Fogers!" he exclaimed without ceremony, "was you
calculatin' on stakin' any claims here?"

"If you mean are we going to dig for gold, we certainly are,"
replied Andy insolently, "and you can't stop us."

"I don't know about that," went on Abe, grimly. "I ain't goin' t'
say nothin' now, about th' way you stole th' map from me, an' made a
copy, but I am goin t' say this, an' that is it won't be healthy fer
any of you t' git in my way, or t' try t' dig on our claims!"

"We'll dig where we please!" cried Andy. "You don't own this
valley!"

"We own as much of it as we care to stake out, by right of prior
discovery!" declared Tom, firmly.

"And I say we'll dig where we please!" insisted Andy. "Hand me a
pick," he went on to another of the natives.

"Wait jest a minute," spoke Abe calmly, as he put his little store
of nuggets in the pocket of his fur coat, and drew out a big
revolver. "It ain't healthy t' talk that way, Andy Foger, an' th'
sooner you find that out th' better. You ain't in Shopton now, an'
th' only law here is what we make for ourselves. Tom, maybe you'd
better get out th' rifles, an' your electric gun, after all. It
seems like we might have trouble," and Abe cooly looked to see if
his weapon was loaded.

"Oh, of course we didn't mean to usurp any of your rights, my dear
friend!" exclaimed Mr. Foger quickly, and he seemed nervous at the
sight of the big revolver, while Andy hastily moved until he was
behind the biggest of the sledge drivers. "We don't want to violate
any of your rights," went on Mr. Foger. "But this valley is large,
and do I understand that you claim all of it?"

"We could if we wanted to," declared Abe stoutly; "but we'll be
content with three-quarter of it, seein' we was here fust. If you
folks want t' dig fer gold, go over there," and he pointed to a spot
some distance away.

"We'll dig where we please!" cried Andy.

"Oh, will you?" and there was an angry light in Abe's eyes. "I
guess, Tom, you'd better git--"

"No! No! My son is wrong--he is too hasty," interposed Mr. Foger.
"We will go away--certainly we will. The valley is large enough for
both of us--just as you say. Come, Andy!"

The bully seemed about to refuse, but a look at Abe's angry face and
a sight of Mr. Damon coming from the cave where the airship was,
with a rifle, for the eccentric man had hastened to get his weapon--this
sight calmed Andy down. Without further words he and his father
got back on their sleds, and were soon being driven off to where a
large ice cave loomed up, about a mile away.

"Good riddance," muttered the miner, "now we kin go on diggin'
without bein' bothered by that little scamp."

"I don't know about that," spoke Tom, shaking his head dubiously.
"There's always trouble when Andy Foger's within a mile. I'm afraid
we haven't seen the last of him."

"He'd better not come around here ag'in," declared Abe. "Queer, how
he should turn up, jest when I made a big strike."

"They must have come on all the way from where their airship was
wrecked, by means of dog sleds," observed Ned, and the others agreed
with him. Later they learned that this was so; that after the
accident to the ANTHONY, the crew had refused to proceed farther
north, and had gone back. But Mr. Foger had hired the natives with
the dog teams, and, by means of the copy of the map and with what
knowledge his Eskimos had, had reached the valley of gold.

"We have certainly struck it rich," went on Abe, as he went back to
where he had dug the hole. "Now we'd better all begin prospectin'
here, for it looks like a big deposit. We'll stake out a large
enough claim to take it all in. I guess Mr. Parker can do that,
seein' as how he knows about such things."

The scientist agreed to do this part of the work, it being
understood that all the gold discovered would be shared equally
after the expenses of the trip had been paid.

Feverishly Abe and the others began to dig. They did not come upon
such a rich deposit as the miner had found, but there were enough
nuggets picked up to prove that the expedition would be very
successful.

No more attention was paid to the Fogers, but through the telescope
Tom could see that the bully and his father had made a camp in one
of the ice caves, and that both were eagerly digging in the frozen
surface of the valley.

Before night several thousand dollars' worth of gold had been taken
out by our friends. It was stored in the airship, and then, after
supper the craft's searchlight was taken off, and placed in such a
position in front of the cave of ice so that the beams would
illuminate the claim staked out by Tom and the others.

"We'll stand watch an' watch," suggested Abe, "but I don't think
them Fogers will come around here ag'in."

They did not, and the night passed peacefully. The next day our
friends were again at work digging for gold. So were the Fogers, as
could be observed through the glass, but it was impossible to see
whether they got any nuggets.

The gold seemed to be in "pockets," and that day the ones in the
vicinity of the strike first made by Abe were cleaned out.

"We'll have to locate some new 'pockets,'" said the miner, and the
adventurers scattered over the frozen plain to look for other
deposits of the precious metal.

Tom and Ned were digging together not far from one another. Suddenly
Ned let out a joyful cry.

"Strike anything?" asked Tom.

"Something rich," answered the bank clerk. He lifted from a hole in
the ground a handful of the golden pebbles.

"It's as good as Abe's was!" exclaimed Tom. "We must stake it out at
once, or the Fogers may jump it. Come on, we'll go back and tell
Abe, and get Mr. Parker and Mr. Damon over here."

The three men were some distance away, and there was no sign of the
Fogers. Tom and Ned hurried back to where their friends were,
leaving their picks and shovels on the frozen ground.

The good news was soon told, and, with some stakes hastily made from
some extra wood carried on the airship, the little party hastened
back to where Tom and Ned had made their strike.

As they emerged from behind a big hummock of ice they saw, standing
over the holes which the lads had dug, Andy Foger and his father!
Each one had a rifle, and there was a smile of triumph on Andy's
face!

"What are you doing here?" cried Tom, the hot blood mounting to his
cheeks.

"We've just staked out a claim here," answered the bully.

"And you deserted it," put in Mr. Foger smoothly. "I think your
mining friend will tell you that we have a right to take up an
abandoned claim."

"But we didn't abandon it!" declared Tom. "We only went away to get
the stakes."

"The claim was abandoned, and we have 'jumped' it," went on Mr.
Foger, and he cocked his rifle. "I need hardly tell you that
possession is nine points of the law, and that we intend to remain.
Andy, is your gun loaded?"

"Yes, pa."

"I--I guess they've got us--fer th' time bein'," murmured Abe, as he
motioned to Tom and the others to come away. "Besides they've got
guns, an' we haven't--but wait," added the miner, mysteriously. "I
haven't played all my tricks yet."




CHAPTER XXIII

ATTACKED BY NATIVES


To state that Tom and his friends were angry at the trick the Fogers
had played on them would be putting it mildly. There was righteous
indignation in their hearts, and, as for the young inventor he felt
that much blame was attached to him for his neglect in not remaining
on guard at the place of the lucky strike while Ned went to call the
others.

"I guess Andy must have been spying on us," spoke Ned, "or he would
never have known when to rush up just as he did; as soon as we
left."

"Probably," admitted Tom, bitterly.

"But, bless my penholder!" cried Mr. Damon. "Can't we do something,
Abe? Won't the law--?"

"There ain't any law out here, except what you make yourself," said
the miner. "I guess they've got us for th' time bein'."

"What do you mean by that?" asked Tom, detecting a gleam of hope in
Abe's tone.

"Well, I mean that I think we kin git ahead of 'em. Come on back to
th' ship, an' we'll talk it over."

They walked away, leaving Andy and his father in possession of the
rich deposits of gold, and that it was much richer even then than
the hole Abe had first discovered was very evident. The two Fogers
were soon at work, digging out the yellow metal with the pick and
shovels Tom and Ned had so thoughtlessly dropped.

"What little law there is out here they've got on their side," went
on Abe, "an' they've got possession, too, which is more. Of course
we could go at 'em in a pitched battle, but I take it you don't want
any bloodshed?" and he looked at Tom.

"Of course not," replied the lad quickly, "but I'd like to meet Andy
alone, with nothing but my fists for a little while," and Tom's eyes
snapped.

"So would I," added Ned.

"Perhaps we can find another pocket of gold better than  that  one,"
suggested Mr. Damon.

"We might," admitted Abe, "but that one was ours an' we're entitled
to it. This valley is rich in gold deposits, but you can't allers
put your hand on 'em. We may have t' hunt around for a week until we
strike another. An', meanwhile, them Fogers will be takin' our gold!
It's not to be borne! I'll find some way of drivin' 'em out. An'
we've got t' do it soon, too."

"You mean if we don't that they'll get all the gold?" asked Mr.
Damon.

"No, I mean that soon it will be th' long night up here, an' we
can't work. We'll have t' go back, an' I don't want t' go back until
I've made my pile."

"Neither do any of us, I guess," spoke Tom, "but there doesn't seem
to be any help for it."

They discussed several plans on reaching the ship, but none seemed
feasible without resorting to force, and this they did not want to
do, as they feared there might be bloodshed. When night closed in
they could see the gleam of a campfire, kindled by the Foger party,
at the gold-pocket, from bits of the scrubby trees that grew in that
frigid clime.

"They're going to stay on guard," announced Tom. "We can't get it
away from them to-night."

Though Abe had spoken of some plan to regain the advantage the
Fogers had of them, the old miner was not quite ready to propose it.
All the next day he seemed very thoughtful, while going about with
the others, seeking new deposits of gold. Luck did not seem to be
with them. They found two or three places where there were traces of
the yellow pebbles, but in no very great quantity.

Meanwhile the Fogers were busy at the pocket Ned had located. They
seemed to be taking out much of the precious metal.

"And it all ought to be ours," declared Tom, bitterly.

"Yes, and it shall be, too!" suddenly exclaimed. Abe. "I think I
have a plan that will beat 'em."

"What is it?" asked Tom.

"Let's get back to the ship, and I'll tell you," said Abe. "We can't
tell when one of their natives might be sneakin' in among these ice
caves, an' they understand some English. They might give my scheme
away."

In brief Abe's plan, as he unfolded it in the cabin of the RED CLOUD
was this:

They would divide into two parties, one consisting of Ned and Tom,
and the other of the three men. The latter, by a circuitous route,
would go to the ice caves where the Fogers had established their
camp. It was there that the Indians remained during the day, while
Andy and his father labored at the gold pocket, for, after the first
day when they had had the natives aid them, father and son had
worked alone at the hole, probably fearing to trust the Indians. At
night, though either Andy or his father remained on guard, with one
or two of the dusky-skinned dog drivers.

"But we'll work this trick before night," said Abe. "We three men
will get around to where the natives are in the ice cave. We'll
pretend to attack them, and raise a great row, firing our guns in
the air, and all that sort of thing, an' yellin' t' beat th' band.
Th' natives will yell, too, you can depend on that."

"Th' Fogers will imagine we are tryin' t' git away with their sleds
an' supplies, an' maybe their gold, if they've got it stored in th'
ice cave. Naturally Andy or his father will run here, an' that will
leave only one on guard at th' mine. Then Tom an' Ned can sneak up.
Th' two of 'em will be a match for even th' old Foger, if he happens
t' stay, an' while Tom or Ned comes up in front, t' hold his
attention, th' other can come up in back, an' grab his arms, if he
tries t' shoot. Likely Andy will remain at th' gold hole, an' you
two lads kin handle him, can't you?"

"Well, I guess!" exclaimed Tom and Ned together.

The plan worked like a charm. Abe, Mr. Damon and Mr. Parker raised a
great din at the ice cave where the Foger natives were. The sound
carried to the hole where Andy and his father were digging out the
gold. Mr. Foger at once ran toward the cave, while Andy, catching up
his gun, remained on the alert.

Then came the chance of Tom and Ned. The latter coming from his
hiding-place, advanced boldly toward the bully, while Tom, making a
detour, worked his way up behind.

"Here! You keep away!" cried Andy, catching sight of Ned. "I see
what the game is, now! It's a trick!"

"You're a nice one to talk about tricks!" declared Ned, advancing
slowly.

"Keep away if you don't want to get hurt!" yelled Andy.

"Oh, you wouldn't hurt me; would you?" mocked Ned, who wanted to
give Tom time to sneak up behind the bully.

"Yes, I would! Keep back!" Andy was nervously fingering his weapon.
The next instant his gun flew from his grasp, and he went over
backward in Tom's strong grip; for the young inventor, in his
sealskin shoes had worked up in the rear without a sound. The next
moment Andy broke away and was running for his life, leaving Tom and
Ned in possession of the gold hole, and that without a shot being
fired. A little later the three men, who had hurried away from the
cave as Mr. Foger rushed up to see what caused the racket, joined
Tom and Ned, and formal possession was taken of their lucky strike.

"We'll guard it well, now," decided Tom, and later that day they
moved some supplies near the hole, and for a shelter built an igloo,
Eskimo fashion, in which work Abe had had some experience. Then they
moved the airship to another ice cave, nearer their "mine" as they
called it, and prepared to stand guard.

But there seemed to be no need, for the following day there was no
trace of the Fogers. They and their natives had disappeared.

"I guess we were too much for them," spoke Tom. But the sequel was
soon to prove differently.

It was three days after our friends had regained their mine, during
which time they had dug out considerable gold, that toward evening,
as Tom was taking the last of the output of yellow pebbles into the
cave where the airship was, he looked across the valley.

"Looks like something coming this way," observed the young inventor.
"Natives, I guess."

"It is," agreed Ned, "quite a large party, too!"

"Better tell Abe and the others," went on Tom. "I don't like the
looks of this. Maybe the sudden disappearance of the Fogers has
something to do with it."

Abe, Mr. Damon and Mr. Parker hurried from the ice cave. They had
caught up their guns as they ran out.

"They're still coming on," called Tom, "and are headed this way."

"They're Indians, all right!" exclaimed Abe. "Hark! What's that?"

It was the sound of shouting and singing.

Through the gathering dusk the party advanced. Our friends closely
scanned them. There was something familiar about the two leading
figures, and it could now be seen that in the rear were a number of
dog sleds.

"There's Andy Foger and his father!" cried Ned. "They've gone and
got a lot of Eskimos to help them drive us away."

"That's right!" admitted Tom. "I guess we're in for it now!"

With a rush the natives, led by the Fogers, came on. They were
yelling now. An instant later they began firing their guns.

"It's a fierce attack!" cried Tom. "Into the ice cave for shelter!
We can cover the gold mine from there. I'll get my electric gun!"




CHAPTER XXIV

THE WRECK OF THE AIRSHIP


Almost before our friends could retreat into the cave which now
sheltered the RED CLOUD, the attacking natives opened fire.
Fortunately they only had old-fashioned, muzzle-loading muskets,
and, as their aim was none of the best, there was comparatively
little danger. The bullets, however, did sing through the
fast-gathering darkness with a vicious sound, and struck the heavy
sides and sloping front of the ice cave with a disconcerting "ping!"

"I don't hear Andy or his father firing!" called Tom, as he and the
others returned the fire of the savage Indians. "I could tell their
guns by the sharper reports. The Fogers carry repeating rifles, and
they're fine ones, if they're anything like the one we took from
Andy, Ned."

"That's right," agreed Tom's chum, "I don't believe Andy or his
father dare fire. They're afraid to, and they're putting the poor
ignorant natives up to it. Probably they hired them to try to drive
us away."

This, as they afterward learned, was exactly the case.

The battle, if such it could be called, was kept up. There was about
a hundred natives, all of whom had guns, and, though they were slow
to load, there were enough weapons to keep up a constant fusilade.
On their part, Tom and the others fired at first over the heads of
the natives, for they did not want to kill any of the deluded men.
Later, though, when they saw the rush keeping up, they fired at
their legs, and disabled several of the Eskimos, the electric gun
proving very effective.

It was now quite dark, and the firing slackened. From their position
in the cave, Tom and the others could command the hole where the
gold was, and, as they saw several natives sneaking up to it the
young inventor and Ned, both of whom were good shots, aimed to have
the bullets strike the ice close to where the Indians were.

This sort of shooting was enough, and the natives scurried away.
Then Tom hit on the plan of playing the searchlight on the spot, and
this effectually prevented an unseen attack. It seemed to discourage
the enemy, too for they did not venture into that powerful glow of
light.

"They won't do anything more until morning," declared Abe. "Then
we'll have it hot an' heavy, though, I'm afeered. Well, we'll have
t' make th' best of it!"

They took turns standing guard that night, but no attack was made.
The fact of the Fogers coming back with the band of Indians told
Tom, more plainly than words, how desperately his enemies would do
battle with them. Anxiously they waited for the morning.

Several times in the night Mr. Parker was seen roaming about
uneasily, though it was not his turn to be on guard. Finally Tom
asked him what was the matter, and if he could not sleep.

"It isn't that," answered the scientist, "but I am worried about the
ice. I can detect a slight but peculiar movement by means of some of
my scientific instruments. I am alarmed about it. I fear something
is going to happen."

But Tom was too worried about the outcome of the fight he knew would
be renewed on the next day, to think much about the ice movement. He
thought it would only be some scientific phenomena that would amount
to little.

With the first streak of the late dawn, the gold-seekers were up,
and partook of a hot breakfast, with strong coffee which Mr. Damon
brewed. Tom took an observation from the mouth of the cave. The
searchlight was still dimly glowing, and it did not disclose
anything. Tom turned it off. He thought he saw a movement among the
ranks of the enemy, who had camped just beyond the gold hole.

"I guess they're coming!" cried the lad. "Get ready for them!"

The adventurers caught up their guns, and hurried to the entrance of
the cave. Mr. Parker lingered behind, and was observed to be
narrowly scanning the walls of the cavern.

"Come on, Parker, my dear man!" begged Mr. Damon. "We are in grave
danger, and we need your help. Bless my life insurance policy! but I
never was in such a state as this."

"We may soon be in a worse one," was the answer of the gloomy
scientist.

"What do you mean?" asked Mr. Damon, but he hurried on without
waiting for a reply.

Suddenly, from without the cave came a series of fierce yells. It
was the battle-cry of the Indians. At the same moment there sounded
a fusillade of guns.

"The battle is beginning!" cried Tom Swift, grimly. He held his
electric gun, though he had not used it very much in the previous
attack, preferring to save it for a time of more need.

As the defenders of the cave reached the entrance they saw the body
of natives rushing forward. They were almost at the gold hole, with
Andy Foger and his father discreetly behind the first row of
Eskimos, when, with a suddenness that was startling, there sounded
throughout the whole valley a weird sound!

It was like the wailing of some giant--the sighing of some mighty
wind. At the same time the air suddenly became dark, and then there
came a violent snow squall, shutting out instantly the sight of the
advancing natives. Tom and the others could not see five feet beyond
the cave.

"This will delay the attack," murmured Ned, "They can't see to come
at us."

Mr. Parker came running up from the interior of the cave. On his
face there was a look of alarm.

"We must leave here at once!" he cried.

"Leave here?" repeated Tom. "Why must we? The enemy are out there!
We'd run right into them!"

"It must be done!" insisted the scientist. "We must leave the cave
at once!"

"What for?" cried Mr. Damon.

"Because the movement of the ice that I predicted, has begun. It is
much more rapid than I supposed it would be. In a short time this
cave and all the others will be crushed flat!"

"Crushed flat!" gasped Tom.

"Yes, the caves of ice are being destroyed! Hark! You can hear them
snapping!"

They all listened. Above the roar of the storm could be made out the
noise of crushing, grinding ice-sounds like cannon being fired, as
the great masses of frozen crystal snapped like frail planks.

"The ice caves are being destroyed by an upheaval of nature!" went
on Mr. Parker. "This one will soon go! The walls are bulging now! We
must get out!"

"But the natives! They will kill us!" cried Mr. Damon. "Bless my
soul! what a trying position to be in."

"I guess the natives are as bad off as we are," suggested Ned.
"They're not firing, and I can hear cries of alarm, I think they're
running away."

There was a lull in the snow flurry, and the white curtain seemed to
lift for a moment. The gold-seekers had a glimpse of the natives in
full retreat, with the Fogers--father and son--racing panic-stricken
after them. Tom could also see a big cave, just beyond the gold
hole, collapse and crumble to pieces like a house of cards.

"We have no time to lose!" Mr. Parker warned them. "The roof of this
cave is slowly coming down. The sides are collapsing! We must get
out!"

"Then wheel out the airship!" cried Tom. "We must save that! We
needn't fear the natives, now!"

The young inventor hurried to the RED CLOUD calling to Ned and the
others. They hastened to his side. It was an easy matter to move the
airship along on the wheels. It neared the opening of the cave. The
rumbling, roaring, grinding sound of the ice increased.

"Why--why!" cried Tom in surprise and alarm, as the craft neared the
mouth of the ice cavern, "we can't get it out--the opening is too
small! Yet it came in easily enough!"

"The cave is collapsing--growing smaller every moment!" cried Mr.
Parker. "We have only time to save our lives! Run out!"

"And leave the airship? Never!" yelled Tom.

"You must! You can't save that and your life!"

"Get axes and make the opening bigger!" suggested Ned, who, like his
chum, could not bear to think of the destruction of the beautiful
craft.

"No time! No time!" shouted Mr. Parker, frantically, "We must get
out! Save what you can from the ship--the gold--some supplies--the
guns--some food--save what you can!"

Then ensued a wild effort to get from the doomed craft what they
could--what they would need if they were to save their lives in that
cold and desolate country. Food, some blankets--their guns--as much
of the gold as they could hastily gather together--their weapons and
some ammunition--all this was carried from the cabin outside the
cave. The entrance was rapidly growing smaller. The roof was already
pressing down on the gas-bag.

Tom gave one last look at his fine craft. There were tears in his
eyes. He started into the cabin for something he had forgotten. Mr.
Parker grabbed him by the arm.

"Don't go in!" he cried hoarsely. "The cave will collapse in another
instant!" He rushed with Tom out of the cavern, and not a moment too
soon. The others were already outside.

Then with a rush and a roar, with a sound like a great explosion,
with a rending, grinding and booming as the great pieces of ice
collapsed one against the other, the big ice cave settled in, as
does some great building when the walls are weakened!

Down crashed the roof of the ice cave! Down upon the RED CLOUD,
burying out of sight, forever, under thousands of tons of ice and
snow, the craft which was the pride of Tom Swift's heart! It was the
end of the airship!

Tom felt a moisture of tears in his eyes as he stood there in the
midst of the snowstorm.




CHAPTER XXV

THE RESCUE--CONCLUSION


For a few moments after the collapse of the cave, and the
destruction of the airship, on which they depended to take them from
that desolate land, no one spoke. The calamity had been too
terrible--they could hardly understand it.

The snow had ceased, and, over the frozen plain, in full retreat,
could be seen the band of attacking Indians. They had fled in terror
at the manifestation of Nature. And Nature, as if satisfied at the
mischief she had wrought, called a halt to the movement of the ice.
The roaring, grinding sounds ceased, and there were no more
collapses of caves in that neighborhood.

"Well, we are up against it," spoke Tom, softly. "Poor old RED
CLOUD! There'll never be another airship like you!"

"We are lucky to have escaped with our lives," said Mr. Parker.
"Another moment and it would have been too late. I was expecting
something like this--I predicted it."

But his honor was an empty one--no one cared to dispute it with him.

"Bless my refrigerator! What's to be done!" exclaimed Mr. Damon.

"Start from here as soon as possible," decided Abe.

"Why, do you think the natives will come back?" asked Ned.

"No, but we have only a small supply of food, my lad, an' it's hard
to git up here. We must hit th' trail fer civilization as soon as we
kin!"

"Go back--how; without the airship?" asked Tom, blankly.

"Walk!" exclaimed the miner, grimly. "It's th' only way!"

They realized that. There was no hope of digging through that mass
of fantastically piled ice to reach the airship, and, even if they
could have done so, it would have been crushed beyond all hope of
repair. Nor could they dig down for more food, though what they had
hastily saved was little enough.

"Well, if we've got to go, we'd better start," suggested Tom, sadly.
"Poor old RED CLOUD!"

"Maybe we can get a little more gold," suggested Ned.

They walked over to the hole whence they had taken the yellow
nuggets. The "pocket" was not to be seen. It was buried out of sight
under tons of ice.

"We'll get no more gold here," decided Abe, "if we get safely out of
th' valley, and t' the nearest white settlement, we'll be lucky."

"Bless my soul! Is it as bad as that!" cried Mr. Damon.

Abe nodded without speaking. There was nothing else to do. Sadly and
silently they made up into packs the things they had saved, and
started southward, guided by a small compass the miner had with him.

It was a melancholy party. Fortunately the weather had turned a
little warmer or they might have been frozen to death. They tramped
all that day, shaping their course to take them out of the valley on
a side well away from where the hostile natives lived. At night they
made rude shelters of snow and blocks of ice and ate cold victuals.
The second day it grew colder, and they were slightly affected by
snow-blindness, for they had lost their dark glasses in the cave.

Even the gold seemed too great a burden to carry, and they found
they had more of it than at first they supposed. On the third day
they were ready to give up, but Abe bravely urged them on. Toward
the close of the fourth day, even the old miner was in despair, for
the food they could carry was not such as to give strength and
warmth, and they saw no game to shoot.

They were just getting ready to go into a cheerless camp for the
night, when Tom, who was a little in advance, looked ahead.

"Ned, do I see something or is it only a vision?" he asked.

"What does it look like?" asked his chum.

"Like Eskimos on sleds."

"That's what it is," agreed Ned, after an observation. "Maybe it's
the Fogers, or some of the savage Indians."

They halted in alarm, and got out their guns. The little party of
natives kept coming on toward them.

Suddenly Abe uttered a cry, but it was one of joy and not fear.

"Hurrah!" he yelled, "It's all right--they're friendly natives!
They're of the same tribe that helped me an' my partner! It's all
right, boys, we're rescued now!"

And so it proved. A few minutes later the gold-seekers were on the
sleds of the friendly Eskimos, some of whom remembered Abe, and the
weary and hungry adventures were being rushed toward the native
village as fast as the dogs could run. It was a hunting party that
had come upon our friends just in time.

Little more remains to be told. Well cared for by the kind Eskimos,
Tom and his friends soon recovered their spirits and strength. They
arranged for dog teams to take them to Sitka, and paid their friends
well for the service, not only in gold, but by presenting what was
of more value, the guns they no longer needed. Tom, however,
retained his electric rifle.

Three weeks after that they were on a steamer bound for
civilization, having bidden their friends the Eskimos good-by.

"Homeward bound," remarked Tom, some time later, as they were in a
train speeding across the continent. "It was a great trip, and the
gold we got will more than repay us, even to building a new airship.
Still, I can't help feeling sorry about the RED CLOUD."

"I don't blame you," returned Ned. "Are you going to build another
airship, Tom?"

"Not one like the RED CLOUD, I think. But I have in mind plans for a
sort of racing craft. I think I'll start it when I get back home."

How Tom's plans developed, and what sort of a craft he built will be
related in the next volume of this series, to be called "Tom Swift
and His Sky Racer; or, the Quickest Flight on Record." In that will
be told how the young inventor foiled his enemies, and how he saved
his father's life. Our friends arrived safely at Shopton in due
season. They learned that the two Fogers had reached there shortly
before them. Tom and his party decided not to prosecute them, and
they did not learn the identity of the men who tried to rob Tom of
the map.

"But I guess Andy won't go about boasting of his airship any more,"
said Ned, "nor of how he got our gold mine away from us. He'll sing
mighty small for a while."

The store of gold brought from the North, proved quite valuable,
though but for the unforeseen accidents our friends could have
secured much more. Yet they were well satisfied. With his share Abe
Abercrombie settled down out West, Mr. Damon gave most of his gold
to his wife, Mr. Parker bought scientific instruments with his, Ned
invested his in bank stock, and Tom Swift, after buying a beautiful
gift for a certain pretty young lady, used part of the remainder to
build his Sky Racer.

And now, for a time, we will take leave of Tom and his friends, and
say good-by.

TOM SWIFT AND HIS SKY RACER



Chapter One

The Prize Offer


"Is this Tom Swift, the inventor of several airships?"

The man who had rung the bell glanced at the youth who answered his
summons.

"Yes, I'm Tom Swift," was the reply. "Did you wish to see me?"

"I do. I'm Mr. James Gunmore, secretary of the Eagle Park Aviation
Association. I had some correspondence with you about a prize contest
we are going to hold. I believe--"

"Oh, yes, I remember now," and the young inventor smiled pleasantly as
he opened wider the door of his home. "Won't you come in? My father
will be glad to see you. He is as much interested in airships as I am."
And Tom led the way to the library, where the secretary of the aviation
society was soon seated in a big, comfortable leather chair.

"I thought we could do better, and perhaps come to some decision more
quickly, if I came to see you, than if we corresponded," went on Mr.
Gunmore. "I hope I haven't disturbed you at any of your inventions,"
and the secretary smiled at the youth.

"No. I'm through for to-day," replied Tom. "I'm glad to see you. I
thought at first it was my chum, Ned Newton. He generally runs over in
the evening."

"Our society, as I wrote you, Mr. Swift, is planning to hold a very
large and important aviation meet at Eagle Park, which is a suburb of
Westville, New York State. We expect to have all the prominent
'bird-men' there, to compete for prizes, and your name was mentioned. I
wrote to you, as you doubtless recall, asking if you did not care to
enter."

"And I think I wrote you that my big aeroplane-dirigible, the Red
Cloud, was destroyed in Alaska, during a recent trip we made to the
caves of ice there, after gold," replied Tom.

"Yes, you did," admitted Mr. Gunmore, "and while our committee was very
sorry to hear that, we hoped you might have some other air craft that
you could enter at our meet. We want to make it as complete as
possible, and we all feel that it would not be so unless we had a Swift
aeroplane there."

"It's very kind of you to say so," remarked Tom, "but since my big
craft was destroyed I really have nothing I could enter."

"Haven't you an aeroplane of any kind? I made this trip especially to
get you to enter. Haven't you anything in which you could compete for
the prizes? There are several to be offered, some for distance flights,
some for altitude, and the largest, ten thousand dollars, for the
speediest craft. Ten thousand dollars is the grand prize, to be awarded
for the quickest flight on record."

"I surely would like to try for that," said Tom, "but the only craft I
have is a small monoplane, the Butterfly, I call it, and while it is
very speedy, there have been such advances made in aeroplane
construction since I made mine that I fear I would be distanced if I
raced in her. And I wouldn't like that."

"No," agreed Mr. Gunmore. "I suppose not. Still, I do wish we could
induce you to enter. I don't mind telling you that we consider you a
drawing-card. Can't we induce you, some way?"

"I'm afraid not. I haven't any machine which--"

"Look here!" exclaimed the secretary eagerly. "Why can't you build a
special aeroplane to enter in the next meet? You'll have plenty of
time, as it doesn't come off for three months yet. We are only making
the preliminary arrangements. It is now June, and the meet is scheduled
for early in September. Couldn't you build a new and speedy aeroplane
in that time?"

Eagerly Mr. Gunmore waited for the answer. Tom Swift seemed to be
considering it. There was an increased brightness to his eyes, and one
could tell that he was thinking deeply. The secretary sought to clinch
his argument.

"I believe, from what I have heard of your work in the past, that you
could build an aeroplane which would win the ten-thousand-dollar
prize," he went on. "I would be very glad if you did win it, and, so I
think, would be the gentlemen associated with me in this enterprise. It
would be fine to have a New York State youth win the grand prize. Come,
Tom Swift, build a special craft, and enter the contest!"

As he paused for an answer footsteps were heard coming along the hall,
and a moment later an aged gentleman opened the door of the library.

"Oh! Excuse me, Tom," he said, "I didn't know you had company." And he
was about to withdraw.

"Don't go, father," said Tom. "You will be as much interested in this
as I am. This is Mr. Gunmore, of the Eagle Park Aviation Association.
This is my father, Mr. Gunmore."

"I've heard of you," spoke the secretary as he shook hands with the
aged inventor. "You and your son have made, in aeronautics, a name to
be proud of."

"And he wants us to go still farther, dad," broke in the youth. "He
wants me to build a specially speedy aeroplane, and race for ten
thousand dollars."

"Hum!" mused Mr. Swift. "Well, are you going to do it, Tom? Seems to me
you ought to take a rest. You haven't been back from your gold-hunting
trip to Alaska long enough to more than catch your breath, and now--"

"Oh, he doesn't have to go in this right away," eagerly explained Mr.
Gunmore. "There is plenty of time to make a new craft."

"Well, Tom can do as he likes about it," said his father. "Do you think
you could build anything speedier than your Butterfly, son?"

"I think so, father. That is, if you'd help me. I have a plan partly
thought out, but it will take some time to finish it. Still, I might
get it done in time."

"I hope you'll try!" exclaimed the secretary. "May I ask whether it
would be a monoplane or a biplane?"

"A monoplane, I think," answered Tom. "They are much more speedy than
the double-deckers, and if I'm going to try for the ten thousand
dollars I need the fastest machine I can build."

"We have the promise of one or two very fast monoplanes for the meet,"
went on Mr. Gunmore. "Would yours be of a new type?"

"I think it would," was the reply of the young inventor. "In fact, I am
thinking of making a smaller monoplane than any that have yet been
constructed, and yet one that will carry two persons. The hardest work
will be to make the engine light enough and still have it sufficiently
powerful to make over a hundred miles an hour, if necessary.

"A hundred miles an hour in a small monoplane! It isn't possible!"
cried the secretary.

"I'll make better time than that," said Tom quietly, and with not a
trace of boasting in his tones.

"Then you'll enter the meet?" asked Mr. Gunmore eagerly.

"Well, I'll think about it," promised Tom. "I'll let you know in a few
days. Meanwhile, I'll be thinking out the details for my new craft. I
have been going to build one ever since I got back, after having seen
my Red Cloud crushed in the ice cave. Now I think I had better begin
active work."

"I hope you will soon let me know," resumed the secretary. "I'm going
to put you down as a possible contestant for the ten-thousand-dollar
prize.  That can do no harm, and I hope you win it. I trust--"

He paused suddenly, and listened. So did Tom Swift and his father, for
they all distinctly heard stealthy footsteps under the open windows of
the library.

"Some one is out there, listening," said Tom in low tones.

"Perhaps it's Eradicate Sampson," suggested Mr. Swift, referring to the
eccentric colored man who was employed by the inventor and his son to
help around the place. "Very likely it was Eradicate, Tom."

"I don't think so," was the lad's answer. "He went to the village a
while ago, and said he wouldn't be back until late to-night. He had to
get some medicine for his mule, Boomerang, who is sick. No, it wasn't
Eradicate; but some one was under that window, trying to hear what we
said."

As he spoke in guarded tones, Tom went softly to the casement and
looked out. He could observe nothing, as the night was dark, and the
new moon, which had been shining, was now dimmed by clouds.

"See anything?" asked Mr. Gunmore as he advanced to Tom's side.

"No," was the low answer. "I can't hear anything now, either."

"I'll go speak to Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper," volunteered Mr.
Swift.  "Perhaps it was she, or she may know something about it."

He started from the room, and as he went Tom noticed, with something of
a start, that his father appeared older that night than he had ever
looked before. There was a trace of pain on the face of the aged
inventor, and his step was lagging.

"I guess dad needs a rest and doctoring up," thought the young inventor
as he turned the electric chandelier off by a button on the wall, in
order to darken the room, so that he might peer out to better
advantage.  "I think he's been working too hard on his wireless motor.
I must get Dr. Gladby to come over and see dad. But now I want to find
out who that was under this window."

Once more Tom looked out. The moon had emerged from behind a thin bank
of clouds, and gave a little light.

"See anything?" asked Mr. Gunmore cautiously.

"No," whispered the youth, for it being a warm might, the windows were
open top and bottom, a screen on the outside keeping out mosquitoes and
other insects. "I can't see a thing," went on Tom, "but I'm sure--"

He paused suddenly. As he spoke there sounded a rustling in the
shrubbery a little distance from the window.

"There's something!" exclaimed Mr. Gunmore.

"I see!" answered the young inventor.

Without another word he softly opened the screen, and then, stooping
down to get under the lower sash (for the windows in the library ran
all the way to the floor), Tom dropped out of the casement upon the
thick grass.

As he did so he was aware of a further movement in the bushes. They
were violently agitated, and a second later a dark object sprang from
them and sprinted along the path.

"Here! Who are you? Hold on!" cried the young inventor.

But the figure never halted. Tom sprang forward, determined to see who
it was, and, if possible, capture him.

"Hold on!" he cried again. There was no answer.

Tom was a good runner, and in a few seconds he had gained on the
fugitive, who could just be seen in the dim light from the crescent
moon.

"I've got you!" cried Tom.

But he was mistaken, for at that instant his foot caught on the
outcropping root of a tree, and the young inventor went flat on his
face.

"Just my luck!" he cried.

He was quickly on his feet again, and took after the fugitive. The
latter glanced back, and, as it happened, Tom had a good look at his
face. He almost came to a stop, so startled was he.

"Andy Foger!" he exclaimed as he recognized the bully who had always
proved himself such an enemy of our hero. "Andy Foger sneaking under my
windows to hear what I had to say about my new aeroplane! I wonder what
his game can be? I'll soon find out!"

Tom was about to resume the chase, when he lost sight of the figure. A
moment later he heard the puffing of an automobile, as some one cranked
it up.

"It's too late!" exclaimed Tom. "There he goes in his car!" And knowing
it would be useless to keep up the chase, the youth turned back toward
his house.




Chapter Two

Mr. Swift is Ill


"Who was it?" asked Mr. Gunmore as Tom again entered the library. "A
friend of yours?"

"Hardly a friend," replied Tom grimly. "It was a young fellow who has
made lots of trouble for me in the past, and who, lately, with his
father, tried to get ahead of me and some friends of mine in locating a
gold claim in Alaska. I don't know what he's up to now, but certainly
it wasn't any good. He's got nerve, sneaking up under our windows!"

"What do you think was his object?"

"It would be hard to say."

"Can't you find him to-morrow, and ask him?"

"There's not much satisfaction in that. The less I have to do with Andy
Foger the better I'm satisfied. Well, perhaps it's just as well I fell,
and couldn't catch him. There would have been a fight, and I don't want
to worry dad any more than I can help. He hasn't been very well of
late."

"No, he doesn't look very strong," agreed the secretary. "But I hope he
doesn't get sick, and I hope no bad consequences result from the
eavesdropping of this Foger fellow."

Tom started for the hall, to get a brush with which to remove some of
the dust gathered in his chase after Andy. As he opened the library
door to go out Mr. Swift came in again.

"I saw Mrs. Baggert, Tom," he said. "She wasn't out under the window,
and, as you said, Eradicate isn't about. His mule is in the barn, so it
couldn't have been the animal straying around."

"No, dad. It was Andy Foger."

"Andy Foger!"

"Yes. I couldn't catch him. But you'd better go lie down, father. It's
getting late, and you look tired."

"I am tired, Tom, and I think I'll go to bed. Have you finished your
arrangements with Mr. Gunmore?"

"Well, I guess we've gone as far as we can until I invent the new
aeroplane," replied Tom, with a smile.

"Then you'll really enter the meet?" asked the secretary eagerly.

"I think I will," decided Tom. "The prize of ten thousand dollars is
worth trying for, and besides that, I'll be glad to get to work again
on a speedy craft. Yes, I'll enter the meet."

"Good!" exclaimed Mr. Gunmore, shaking hands with the young inventor.
"I didn't have my trip for nothing, then. I'll go back in the morning
and report to the committee that I've been successful. I am greatly
obliged to you."

He left the Swift home, after refusing Tom's invitation to remain all
night, and went to his hotel. Tom then insisted that his father retire.

As for the young inventor, he was not satisfied with the result of his
attempt to catch Andy Foger. He had no idea why the bully was hiding
under the library window, but Tom surmised that some mischief might be
afoot.

"Sam Snedecker or Pete Bailey, the two cronies of Andy, may still be
around here, trying to play some trick on me," mused Tom. "I think I'll
take a look outside." And taking a stout cane from the umbrella rack,
the youth sallied forth into the yard and extensive grounds surrounding
his house.

While he is thus looking for possible intruders we will tell you a
little more about him than has been possible since the call of the
aviation secretary.

Tom Swift lived with his father, Barton Swift, in the town of Shopton,
New York State. The young man had followed in the footsteps of his
parent, and was already an inventor of note.

Their home was presided over by Mrs. Baggert, as housekeeper, since
Mrs. Swift had been dead several years. In addition, there was Garret
Jackson, an engineer, who aided Tom and his father, and Eradicate
Sampson, an odd colored man, who, with his mule, Boomerang, worked
about the place.

In the first volume of this series, entitled "Tom Swift and his
Motor-Cycle," here was related how he came to possess that machine. A
certain Mr. Wakefield Damon, an eccentric gentleman, who was always
blessing himself, or something about him, owned the cycle, but he came
to grief on it, and sold it to Tom very cheaply.

Tom had a number of adventures on the wheel, and, after having used the
motor to save a valuable patent model from a gang of unscrupulous men,
the lad acquired possession of a power boat, in which he made several
trips, and took part in many exciting happenings.

Some time later, in company with John Sharp, an aeronaut, whom Tom had
rescued from Lake Carlopa, after the airman had nearly lost his life in
a burning balloon, the young inventor made a big airship, called the
Red Cloud. With Mr. Damon, Tom made several trips in this craft, as set
forth in the book, "Tom Swift and His Airship."

It was after this that Tom and his father built a submarine boat, and
went under the ocean for sunken treasure, and, following that trip Tom
built a speedy electric runabout, and by a remarkable run in that, with
Mr. Damon, saved a bank from ruin, bringing gold in time to stave off a
panic.

"Tom Swift and His Wireless Message" told of the young inventor's plan
to save the castaways of Earthquake Island, and how he accomplished it
by constructing a wireless plant from the remains of the wrecked
airship Whizzer. After Tom got back from Earthquake Island he went with
Mr. Barcoe Jenks, whom he met on the ill-fated bit of land, to discover
the secret of the diamond makers. They found the mysterious men, but
the trip was not entirely successful, for the mountain containing the
cave where the diamonds were made was destroyed by a lightning shock,
just as Mr. Parker, a celebrated scientist, who accompanied the party,
said it would be.

But his adventure in seeking to discover the secret of making precious
stones did not satisfy Tom Swift, and when he and his friends got back
from the mountains they prepared to go to Alaska to search for gold in
the caves of ice. They were almost defeated in their purpose by the
actions of Andy Foger and his father, who in an under-hand manner, got
possession of a valuable map, showing the location of the gold, and
made a copy of the drawing.

Then, when Tom and his friends set off in the Red Cloud, as related in
"Tom Swift in the Caves of Ice," the Fogers, in another airship, did
likewise. But Tom and his party were first on the scene, and
accomplished their purpose, though they had to fight the savage
Indians.  The airship was wrecked in a cave of ice, that collapsed on
it, and the survivors had desperate work getting away from the frozen
North.

Tom had been home all the following winter and spring, and he had done
little more than work on some small inventions, when a new turn was
given his thoughts and energies by a visit from Mr. Gunmore, as
narrated in the first chapter of the present volume.

"Well, I guess no one is here," remarked the young inventor as he
completed the circuit of the grounds and walked slowly back toward the
house. "I think I scared Andy so that he won't come back right away. He
had the laugh on me, though, when I stumbled and fell."

As Tom proceeded he heard some one approaching, around the path at the
side of the house.

"Who's there?" he called quickly, taking a firmer grasp of his stick.

"It's me, Massa Swift," was the response. "I jest come back from town.
I got some peppermint fo' mah mule, Boomerang, dat's what I got."

"Oh! It's you, is it, Rad?" asked the youth in easier tones.

"Dat's who it am. Did yo' t'ink it were some un else?"

"I did," replied Tom. "Andy Foger has been sneaking around. Keep your
eyes open the rest of the night, Rad."

"I will, Massa Tom."

The youth went into the house, having left word with the engineer, Mr.
Jackson, to be on the alert for anything suspicious.

"And now I guess I'll go to bed, and make an early start to-morrow
morning, planning my new aeroplane," mused Tom. "I'm going to make the
speediest craft of the air ever seen!"

As he started toward his room Tom Swift heard the voice of the
housekeeper calling to him:

"Tom! Oh, Tom! Come here, quickly!"

"What's the matter?" he asked, in vague alarm.

"Something has happened to your father!" was the startling reply. "He's
fallen down, and is unconscious! Come quickly! Send for the doctor!"

Tom fairly ran toward his father's room.




Chapter Three

The Plans Disappear


Mr. Swift was lying on the floor, where he had fallen, in front of his
bed, as he was preparing to retire. There was no mark of injury upon
him, and at first, as he knelt down at his father's side, Tom was at a
loss to account for what had taken place.

"How did it happen? When was it?" he asked of Mrs. Baggert, as he held
up his father's head, and noted that the aged man was breathing
slightly.

"I don't know what happened, Tom," answered the housekeeper, "but I
heard him fall, and ran upstairs, only to find him lying there, just
like that. Then I called you. Hadn't you better have a doctor?"

"Yes; we'll need one at once. Send Eradicate. Tell him to run--not to
wait for his mule--Boomerang is too slow. Oh, no! The telephone, of
course! Why didn't I think of that at first? Please telephone for Dr.
Gladby, Mrs. Baggert. Ask him to come as soon as possible, and then
tell Garret Jackson to step here. I'll have him help me get father into
bed."

The housekeeper hastened to the instrument, and was soon in
communication with the physician, who promised to call at once. The
engineer was summoned from another part of the house, and then
Eradicate was aroused.

Mrs. Baggert had the colored man help her get some kettles of hot water
in readiness for possible use by the doctor. Mr. Jackson aided Tom to
lift Mr. Swift up on the bed, and they got off some of his clothes.

"I'll try to see if I can revive him with a little aromatic spirits of
ammonia," decided Tom, as he noticed that his father was still
unconscious. He hastened to prepare the strong spirits, while he was
conscious of a feeling of fear and alarm, mingled with sadness.

Suppose his father should die? Tom could not bear to think of that. He
would be left all alone, and how much he would miss the companionship
and comradeship of his father none but himself knew.

"Oh! but I mustn't think he's going to die!" exclaimed the youth, as he
mixed the medicine.

Mr. Swift feebly opened his eyes after Tom and Mr. Jackson had
succeeded in forcing some of the ammonia between his lips.

"Where am I? What happened?" asked the aged inventor faintly.

"We don't know, exactly," spoke Tom softly. "You are ill, father. I've
sent for the doctor. He'll fix you up. He'll be here soon."

"Yes, I'm--I'm ill," murmured the aged man. "Something hurts me--here,"
and he put his hand over his heart.

Tom felt a nameless sense of fear. He wished now that he had insisted
on his parent consulting a physician some time before, when Mr. Swift
first complained of a minor ailment. Perhaps now it was too late.

"Oh! when will that doctor come?" murmured Tom impatiently.

Mrs. Baggert, who was nervously going in and out of the room, again
went to the telephone.

"He's on his way," the housekeeper reported. "His wife said he just
started out in his auto."

Dr. Gladby hurried into the room a little later, and cast a quick look
at Mr. Swift, who had again lapsed into unconsciousness.

"Do you think he--think he's going to die?" faltered Tom. He was no
longer the self-reliant young inventor. He could meet danger bravely
when it threatened himself alone, but when his father was stricken he
seemed to lose all courage.

"Die? Nonsense!" exclaimed the doctor heartily. "He's not dead yet, at
all events, and while there's life there's hope. I'll soon have him out
of this spell."

It was some little time, however, before Mr. Swift again opened his
eyes, but he seemed to gain strength from the remedies which Dr. Gladby
administered, and in about an hour the inventor could sit up.

"But you must be careful," cautioned the physician. "Don't overdo
yourself. I'll be in again in the morning, and now I'll leave you some
medicine, to be taken every two hours."

"Oh, I feel much better," said Mr. Swift, and his voice certainly
seemed stronger. "I can't imagine what happened. I came upstairs, after
Tom had received a visit from the minister, and that's all I remember."

"The minister, father!" exclaimed Tom, in great amazement. "The
minister wasn't here this evening! That was Mr. Gunmore, the aviation
secretary.  Don't you remember?"

"I don't remember any gentleman like that calling here to-night," Mr.
Swift said blankly. "It was the minister, I'm sure, Tom."

"The minister was here last night, Mr. Swift," said the housekeeper.

"Was he? Why, it seems like to-night. And I came upstairs after talking
to him, and then it all got black, and--and--"

"There, now; don't try to think," advised the doctor. "You'll be all
right in the morning."

"But I can't remember anything about that aviation man," protested Mr.
Swift. "I never used to be that way--forgetting things. I don't like
it!"

"Oh, it's just because you're tired," declared the physician. "It will
all come back to you in the morning. I'll stop in and see you then. Now
try to go to sleep." And he left the room.

Tom followed him, Mrs. Baggert and Mr. Jackson remaining with the sick
man.

"What is the matter with my father, Dr. Gladby?" asked Tom earnestly,
as the doctor prepared to take his departure. "Is it anything serious?"

"Well," began the medical man, "I would not be doing my duty, Tom, if I
did not tell you what it is. That is, it is comparatively serious, but
it is curable, and I think we can bring him around. He has an affection
of the heart, that, while it is common enough, is sometimes fatal.

"But I do not think it will be so in your father's case. He has a fine
constitution, and this would never have happened had he not been run
down from overwork. That is the principal trouble. What he needs is
rest; and then, with the proper remedies, he will be as well as before."

"But that strange lapse of memory, doctor?"

"Oh, that is nothing. It is due to the fact that he has been using his
brain too much. The brain protests, and refuses to work until rested.
Your father has been working rather hard of late hasn't he?"

"Yes; on a new wireless motor."

"I thought so. Well, a good rest is what he needs, and then his mind
and body will be in tune again. I'll be around in the morning."

Tom was somewhat relieved by the doctor's words, but not very much so,
and he spent an anxious night, getting up every two hours to administer
the medicine. Toward morning Mr. Swift fell into a heavy sleep, and did
not awaken for some time.

"Oh, you're much better!" declared Dr. Gladby when he saw his patient
that day.

"Yes, I feel better," admitted Mr. Swift.

"And can't you remember about Mr. Gunmore calling?" asked Tom.

The aged inventor shook his head, with a puzzled air.

"I can't remember it at all," he said. "The minister is the last person
I remember calling here."

Tom looked worried, but the physician said it was a common feature of
the disease from which Mr. Swift suffered, and would doubtless pass
away.

"And you don't remember how we talked about me building a speedy
aeroplane and trying for the ten-thousand-dollar prize?" asked Tom.

"I can't remember a thing about it," said the inventor, with a puzzled
shake of his head, "and I'm not going to try, at least not right away.
But, Tom, if you're going to build a new aeroplane, I want to help you.
I'll give you the benefit of my advice. I think my new form of motor
can be used in it."

"Now! now! No inventions--at least not just yet!" objected the
physician. "You must have a good rest first, Mr. Swift, and get strong.
Then you and Tom can build as many airships as you like."

Mr. Swift felt so much better about three days later that he wanted to
get right to work planning the airship that was to win the big prize,
but the doctor would not hear of it. Tom, however, began to make rough
sketches of what he had in mind changing them from time to time. He
also worked on a type of motor, very light, and modeled after one his
father had recently patented.

Then a new idea came to Tom in regard to the shape of his aeroplane,
and he worked several days drawing the plans for it. It was a new idea
in construction, and he believed it would give him the great speed he
desired.

"But I'd like dad to see it," he said. "As soon as he's well enough
I'll go over it with him."

That time came a week later, and with a complete set of the plans,
embodying his latest ideas, Tom went into the library where his father
was seated in an easy-chair. Dr. Gladby had said it would not now harm
the aged inventor to do a little work. Tom spread the drawings out in
front of his father, and began to explain them in detail.

"I really think you have something great there, Tom!" exclaimed Mr.
Swift, at length. "It is a very small monoplane, to be sure, but I
think with the new principle you have introduced it will work; but, if
I were you, I'd shape those wing tips a little differently."

"No, they're better that way," said Tom pleasantly, for he did not
often disagree with his father. "I'll show you from a little model I
have made. I'll get it right away."

Anxious to demonstrate that he was right in his theory, Tom hurried
from the library to get the model of which he had spoken. He left the
roll of plans lying on a small table near where his father was seated.

"There, you see, dad," said the young inventor as he re-entered the
library a few minutes later, "when you warp the wing tips in making a
spiral ascent it throws your tail wings out of plumb, and so--"

Tom paused in some amazement, for Mr. Swift was lying back in his
chair, with his eyes closed. The lad started in alarm, laid aside his
model, and sprang to his father's side.

"He's had another of those heart attacks!" gasped Tom. He was just
going to call Mrs. Baggert, when Mr. Swift opened his eyes. He looked
at Tom, and the lad could see that they were bright, and did not show
any signs of illness.

"Well, I declare!" exclaimed the inventor. "I must have dozed off, Tom,
while you were gone. That's what I did. I fell asleep!"

"Oh!" said Tom, much relieved. "I was afraid you were ill again. Now,
in this model, as you will see by the plans, it is necessary--"

He paused, and looked over at the table where he had left the drawings.
They were not there!

"The plans, father!" Tom exclaimed. "The plans I left on the table!
Where are they?"

"I haven't touched them," was the answer. "They were on that table,
where you put them, when I closed my eyes for a little nap. I forgot
all about them. Are you sure they're missing?"

"They're not here!" And Tom gazed wildly about the room. "Where can
they have gone?"

"I wasn't out of my chair," said Mr. Swift, "I ought not to have gone
to sleep, but--"

Tom fairly jumped toward the long library window, the same one from
which he had leaped to pursue Andy Foger. The casement was open, and
Tom noted that the screen was also unhooked. It had been closed when he
went to get the model, he was sure of that.

"Look, dad! See!" he exclaimed, as he picked up from the floor a small
piece of paper.

"What is it, Tom?"

"A sheet on which I did some figuring. It is no good, but it was in
with the plans. It must have dropped out."

"Do you mean that some one has been in here and taken the plans of your
new aeroplane, Tom?" gasped his father.

"That's just what I mean! They sneaked in here while you were dozing,
took the plans, and jumped out of the window with them. On the way this
paper fell out. It's the only clue we have. Stay here, dad. I'm going
to have a look." And Tom jumped from the library window and ran down
the path after the unknown thief.




Chapter Four

Anxious Days


Peering on all sides as he dashed along the gravel walk, hoping to
catch a glimpse of the unknown intruder in the garden or shrubbery, Tom
sprinted on at top speed. Now and then he paused to listen, but no
sound came to him to tell of some one in retreat before him. There was
only Silence.

"Mighty queer," mused the youth. "Whoever it was, he couldn't have had
more than a minute start of me--no, not even half a minute--and yet
they've disappeared as completely as though the ground had opened and
let them down; and the worst of it is, that they've taken my plans with
them!"

He turned about and retraced his steps, making a careful search. He saw
no one, until, turning a corner, a little later, he met Eradicate
Sampson.

"You haven't seen any strangers around here just now, have you, Rad?"
asked Tom anxiously.

"No, indeedy, I hasn't, Massa Tom. What fo' kind ob a stranger was him?"

"That's just what I don't know. Rad. But some one sneaked into the
library just now and took some of my plans while my father dozed off. I
jumped out after him as soon as I could, but he has disappeared."

"Maybe it were th' man who done stowed hisself away on yo' airship, de
time yo' all went after de diamonds," suggested the colored man.

"No, it couldn't have been him. If it was anybody, it was Andy Foger,
or some of his crowd. You didn't see Andy, did you, Rad?"

"No, indeedy; but if I do, I suah will turn mah mule, Boomerang, loose
on him, an' he won't take any mo' plans--not right off, Massa Tom."

"No, I guess not. Well, I must get back to dad, or he'll worry. Keep
your eyes open, Rad, and if you see Andy Foger, or any one else, around
here, let me know. Just sing out for all you're worth."

"Shall I call out, Massa Tom, ef I sees dat blessin' man?"

"You mean Mr. Damon?"

"Dat's de one. De gen'man what's allers a-blessin' ob hisself or his
shoelaces, or suffin laik dat. Shall I sing out ef I sees him?"

"Well, no; not exactly, Rad. Just show Mr. Damon up to the house. I'd
be glad to see him again, though I don't fancy he'll call. He's off on
a little trip, and won't be back for a week. But watch out, Rad." And
with that Tom turned toward the house, shaking his head over the puzzle
of the missing plans.

"Did you find any one?" asked his father eagerly as the young inventor
entered the library.

"No," was the gloomy answer. "There wasn't a sign of any one."

Tom went over to the window and looked about for clues. There was none
that he could see, and a further examination of the ground under the
window disclosed nothing. There was gravel beneath the casement, and
this was not the best medium for retaining footprints. Nor were the
gravel walks any better.

"Not a sign of any one," murmured Tom. "Are you sure you didn't hear
any noise, dad, when you dozed off?"

"Not a sound, Tom. In fact, it's rather unusual for me to go to sleep
like that, but I suppose it's because of my illness. But I couldn't
have been asleep long--not more than two minutes."

"That's what I think. Yet in that time someone, who must have been on
the watch, managed to get in here and take my plans for the new sky
racer. I don't see how they got the wire screen open from the outside,
though. It fastens with a strong hook."

"And was the screen open?" asked Mr. Swift

"Yes, it was unhooked. Either they pushed a wire in through the mesh,
caught it under the hook, and pulled it up from the outside, or else
the screen was opened from the inside."

"I don't believe they could get inside to open the screen without some
of us seeing them," spoke the older inventor. "More likely, Tom, it
wasn't hooked, and they found it an easy matter to simply pull it open."

"That's possible. I'll ask Mrs. Baggert if the screen was unhooked."

But the housekeeper could not be certain on that point, and so that
part of the investigation amounted to nothing.

"It's too bad!" exclaimed Mr. Swift. "It's my fault, for dozing off
that way."

"No, indeed, it isn't!" declared Tom stoutly.

"Is the loss a serious one?" asked his father. "Have you no copy of the
plans?"

"Yes, I have a rough draft from which I made the completed drawings,
and I can easily make another set. But that isn't what worries me--the
mere loss of the plans."

"What is it, then, Tom?"

"The fact that whoever took them must know that they are the plans for
a sky racer that is to take part in the big meet. I have worked it out
on a new principle, and it is not yet patented. Whoever stole my plans
can make the same kind of a sky racer that I intended to construct, and
so stand as good a chance to win the prize of ten thousand dollars as I
will."

"That certainly is too bad, Tom. I never thought of that. Do you
suspect any one?"

"No one, unless it's Andy Foger. He's mean enough to do a thing like
that, but I didn't think he'd have the nerve. However, I'll see if I
can learn anything about him. He may have been sneaking around, and if
he has my plans he'd ask nothing better than to make a sky racer and
beat me."

"Oh, Tom, I'm so sorry!" exclaimed Mr. Swift "I--I feel very bad about
it!"

"There, never mind!" spoke the lad, seeing that his father was looking
ill again. "Don't think any more about it, dad. I'll get back those
plans. Come, now. It's time for your medicine, and then you must lie
down." For the aged inventor was looking tired and weak.

Wearily he let Tom lead him to his room, and after seeing that the
invalid was comfortable Tom called up Dr. Gladby, to have him come and
see Mr. Swift. The doctor said his patient had been overdoing himself a
little, and must rest more if he was to completely recover.

Learning that his father was no worse, Tom set off to find Andy Foger.

"I can't rest until I know whether or not he has my plans," he said to
himself. "I don't want to make a speedy aeroplane, and find out at the
last minute that Andy, or some of his cronies, have duplicated it."

But Tom got little satisfaction from Andy Foger. When that bully was
accused of having been around Tom's house he denied it, and though the
young inventor did not actually accuse him of taking the plans, he
hinted at it. Andy muttered many indignant negatives, and called on
some of his cronies to witness that at the time the plans were taken he
and they were some distance from the Swift home.

So Tom was baffled; and though he did not believe the red-haired lad's
denial, there was no way in which he could prove to the contrary.

"If he didn't take the plans, who did?" mused Tom.

As the young inventor turned away after cross-questioning Andy, the
bully called out:

"You'll never win that ten thousand dollars!"

"What do you know about that?" demanded Tom quickly.

"Oh, I know," sneered Andy. "There'll be bigger and better aeroplanes
in that meet than you can make, and you'll never win the prize."

"I suppose you heard about the affair by sneaking around under our
windows, and listening," said Tom.

"Never mind how I know it, but I do," retorted the bully.

"Well, I'll tell you one thing," said Tom calmly. "If you come around
again it won't be healthy for you. Look out for live wires, if you try
to do the listening act any more, Andy!" And with that ominous warning
Tom turned away.

"What do you suppose he means, Andy?" asked Pete Bailey, one of Andy's
cronies.

"It means he's got electrical wires strung around his place," declared
Sam Snedecker, "and that we'll be shocked if we go up there. I'm not
going!"

"Me, either," added Pete, and Andy laughed uneasily.

Tom heard what they said, and in the next few days he made himself busy
by putting some heavy wires in and about the grounds where they would
show best. But the wires carried no current, and were only displayed to
impress a sense of fear on Andy and his cronies, which purpose they
served well.

But it was like locking the stable door after the horse had been
stolen, for with all the precautions he could take Tom could not get
back his plans, and he spent many anxious days seeking them. They
seemed to have completely disappeared, however, and the young inventor
decided there was nothing else to do but to draw new ones.

He set to work on them, and in the meanwhile tried to learn whether or
not Andy had the missing plans. He sought this information by stealth,
and was aided by his chum, Ned Newton. But all to no purpose. Not the
slightest trace or clue was discovered.




Chapter Five

Building the Sky Racer


"What will you do, if, after you have your little monoplane all
constructed, and get ready to race, you find that some one else has one
exactly like it at the meet?" asked Ned Newton one day, when he and Tom
were out in the big workshop, talking things over. "What will you do,
Tom?"

"I don't see that there is anything I can do. I'll go on to the meet,
of course, and trust to some improvements I have since brought out, and
to what I know about aeroplanes, to help me win the race. I'll know,
too, who stole my plans."

"But it will be too late, then."

"Yes, too late, perhaps, to stop them from using the drawings, but not
too late to punish them for the theft. It's a great mystery, and I'll
be on the anxious seat all the while. But it can't be helped."

"When are you going to start work on the sky racer?"

"Pretty soon, now. I've got another set of plans made, and I've fixed
them so that if they are stolen it won't do any one any good."

"How's that?"

"I've put in a whole lot of wrong figures and measurements, and scores
of lines and curves that mean nothing. I have marked the right figures
and lines by a secret mark, and when I work on them I'll use only the
proper ones. But any one else wouldn't know this. Oh, I'll fool 'em
this time!"

"I hope you do. Well, when you get the machine done I'd like to ride in
it. Will it carry two, as your Butterfly does?"

"Yes, only it will be much different; and, of course, it will go much
faster. I'll give you a ride, all right, Ned. Well, now I must get busy
and see what material I need for what I hope will prove to be the
speediest aeroplane in the world."

"That's going some! I must be leaving now. Don't forget your promise. I
saw Mary Nestor on my way over here. She was asking for you. She said
you must be very busy, for she hadn't seen you in some time."

"Um!" was all Tom answered, but by the blush that mounted to his face
it was evident that he was more interested in Mary Nestor than his mere
exclamation indicated.

When Ned had gone Tom got out pencil and paper, and was busily engaged
in making some intricate calculations. He drew odd little sketches on
the margin of the sheet, and then wrote out a list of the things he
would need to construct the new aeroplane.

This finished, he went to Mr. Jackson, the engineer, and asked him to
get the various things together, and to have them put in the special
shop where Tom did most of his work.

"I want to get the machine together as soon as I can," he remarked to
the engineer, "for it will need to be given a good tryout before I
enter in the race, and I may find that I'll have to make several
changes in it."

Mr. Jackson promised to attend to the matter right away, and then Tom
went in to talk to his father about the motor that was to whirl the
propeller of the new air craft.

Mr. Swift had improved very much in the past few days, and though Dr.
Gladby said he was far from being well, the physician declared there
was no reason why he should not do some inventive work.

He and Tom were deep in an argument of gasoline motors, discussing the
best manner of attaching the fins to the cylinders to make them
air-cooled, when a voice sounded outside, the voice of Eradicate:

"Heah! Whar yo' goin'?" demanded the colored man. "Whar yo' goin'?"

"Somebody's out in the garden!" exclaimed Tom, jumping up suddenly.

"Perhaps it's the same person who took the plans!" suggested Mr. Swift.

"Hold on, dere!" yelled Eradicate again.

Then a voice replied:

"Bless my insurance policy! What's the matter? Have there been burglars
around? Why all these precautions? Bless my steam heater! Don't you
know me?"

"Mr. Damon!" cried Tom, a look of pleasure coming over his face. "Mr.
Damon is coming!"

"So I should judge," responded Mr. Swift, with a smile. "I wonder why
Eradicate didn't recognize him?"

They learned why a moment later, for on looking from the library
window, Tom saw the colored man coming up the walk behind a
well-dressed gentleman.

"Why, mah goodness! It's Mr. Damon!" exclaimed Eradicate. "I didn't
know yo', sah, wif dem whiskers on! I didn't, fo' a fac'!"

"Bless my razor! I suppose it does make a difference," said the
eccentric man. "Yes, my wife thought I'd look better, and more sedate,
with a beard, so I grew one to please her. But I don't like it. A beard
is too warm this kind of weather; eh, Tom?" And Mr. Damon waved his
hand to the young inventor and his father, who stood in the low windows
of the library. "Entirely too warm, bless my finger-nails, yes!"

"I agree with you!" exclaimed Tom. "Come in! We're glad to see you!"

"I called to see if you aren't going on another trip to the North Pole,
or somewhere in the Arctic regions," went on Mr. Damon.

"Why?" inquired Tom.

"Why, then this heavy beard of mine would come in handy. It would keep
my throat and chin warm." And Mr. Damon ran his hands through his
luxuriant whiskers.

"No more northern trips right away," said Tom. "I'm about to build a
speedy monoplane, to take part in the big meet at Eagle Park."

"Oh, yes, I heard about the meet," said Mr. Damon. "I'd like to be in
that."

"Well, I'm building a machine that will carry two," went on Tom, "and
if you think you can stand a speed of a hundred miles an hour, or
better, I'll let you come with me. There are some races where a
passenger is allowed."

"Have you got a razor?" asked Mr. Damon suddenly.

"What for?" inquired Mr. Swift, wondering what the eccentric man was
going to do.

"Why, bless my shaving soap! I'm going to cut off my beard. If I go in
a monoplane at a hundred miles an hour I don't want to make any more
resistance to the wind than possible, and my whiskers would certainly
hold back Tom's machine. Where's a razor? I'm going to shave at once.
My wife won't mind when I tell her what it's for. Lend me a razor,
please, Tom."

"Oh, there's plenty of time," explained the lad, with a laugh. "The
race doesn't take place for over two months. But when it does, I think
you would be better off without a beard."

"I know it," said Mr. Damon simply. "I'll shave before we enter the
contest, Tom. But now tell me all about it."

Tom did so, relating the story of the theft of the plans. Mr. Damon was
for having Andy arrested at once, but Mr. Swift and his son pointed out
that they had no evidence against him.

"All we can do," said the young inventor, "is to keep watch on him, and
see if he is building another aeroplane. He has all the facilities, and
he may attempt to get ahead of me. If he enters a sky craft at the meet
I'll be pretty sure that he has made it from my stolen plans."

"Bless my wing tips!" cried Mr. Damon. "But can't we do anything to
stop him?"

"I'm afraid not," answered Tom; and then he showed Mr. Damon his
re-drawn plans, and told in detail of how he intended to construct the
new aeroplane.

The eccentric man remained as the guest of the Swift family that night,
departing for his home the next day, and promising to be on hand as
soon as Tom was ready to test his new craft, which would be in about a
month.

As the days passed, Tom, with the help of his father, whose health was
slightly better, and with the aid of Mr. Jackson, began work on the
speedy little sky racer.

As you boys are all more or less familiar with aeroplanes, we will not
devote much space to the description of the new one Tom Swift made. We
can describe it in general terms, but there were some features of it
which Tom kept a secret from all save his father.

Suffice it to say that Tom had decided to build a small air craft of
the single-wing type, known as the monoplane. It was to be a cross
between the Bleriot and the Antoinette, with the general features of
both, but with many changes or improvements.

The wings were shaped somewhat like those of a humming-bird, which, as
is well known, can, at times, vibrate its wings with such velocity that
the most rapid camera lens cannot quite catch.

And when it is known that a bullet in flight has been successfully
photographed, the speed of the wings of the humming-bird can be better
appreciated.

The writer has seen a friend, with a very rapid camera, which was used
to snap automobiles in flight, attempt to take a picture of a
humming-bird. He got the picture, all right, but the plate was blurred,
showing that the wings had moved faster than the lens could throw them
on the sensitive plate.

Not that Tom intended the wings of his monoplane to vibrate, but he
adopted that style as being the best adapted to allow of rapid flight
through the air; and the young inventor had determined that he would
clip many minutes from the best record yet made.

The body of his craft, between the forward wings and the rear ones,
where the rudders were located, was shaped like a cigar, with side
wings somewhat like the fin keels of the ocean liner to prevent a
rolling motion. In addition, Tom had an ingenious device to
automatically adapt his monoplane to sudden currents of air that might
overturn it, and this device was one of the points which he kept secret.

The motor, which was air-cooled, was located forward, and was just
above the heads of the operator and the passenger who sat beside him.
The single propeller, which was ten feet in diameter, gave a minimum
thrust of one thousand pounds at two thousand revolutions per minute.

This was one feature wherein Tom's craft differed from others. The
usual aeroplane propeller is eight feet in diameter, and gives from
four to five hundred pounds thrust at about one thousand revolutions
per minute, so it can be readily seen wherein Tom had an advantage.

"But I'm building this for speed," he said to Mr. Jackson, "and I'm
going to get it! We'll make a hundred miles an hour without trouble."

"I believe you," replied the engineer. "The motor you and your father
have made is a wonder for lightness and power."

In fact, the whole monoplane was so light and frail as to give one the
idea of a rather large model, instead of a real craft, intended for
service. But a careful inspection showed the great strength it had, for
it was braced and guyed in a new way, and was as rigid as a
steel-trussed bridge.

"What are you going to call her?" asked Mr. Jackson, about two weeks
after they had started work on the craft, and when it had begun to
assume shape and form.

"I'm going to name her the Humming-Bird," replied Tom. "She's little,
but oh, my!"

"And I guess she'll bring home the prize," added the engineer.

And as the days went by, and Tom, his father and Mr. Jackson continued
to work on the speedy craft, this hope grew in the heart of the young
inventor. But he could not rid himself of worry as to the fate of the
plans that had disappeared. Who had them? Was some one making a machine
like his own from them? Tom wished he knew.




Chapter Six

Andy Foger Will Contest


One afternoon, as Tom was working away in the shop on his sky racer,
adjusting one of the rear rudders, and pausing now and then to admire
the trim little craft, he heard some one approaching. Looking out
through a small observation peephole made for this purpose, he saw Mrs.
Baggert hurrying toward the building.

"I wonder what's the matter?" he said aloud, for there was a look of
worriment on the lady's face. Tom threw open the door. "What is it,
Mrs. Baggert?" he called. "Some one up at the house who wants to see
me?"

"No, it's your father!" panted the housekeeper, for she was quite
stout.  "He is very ill again, and I can't seem to get Dr. Gladby on
the telephone. Central says he doesn't answer."

"My father worse!" cried Tom in alarm, dropping his tools and hurrying
from the shop. "Where's Eradicate? Send him for the doctor. Perhaps the
wires are broken. If he can't locate Dr. Gladby, get Dr. Kurtz. We must
have some one. Here, Rad! Where are you?" he called, raising his voice.

"Heah I be!" answered the colored man, coming from the direction of the
garden, which he had been weeding.

"Get out your mule, and go for Dr. Gladby. If he isn't home, get Dr.
Kurtz. Hurry, Rad!"

"I's mighty sorry, Massa Tom," answered the colored man, "but I cain't
hurry, nohow."

"Why not?"

"Because Boomerang done gone lame, an' he won't run. I'll go mahse'f,
but I cain't take dat air mule."

"Never mind. I'll go in the Butterfly," decided Tom quickly. "I'll run
up to the house and see how dad is, and while I'm gone, Rad, you get
out the Butterfly. I can make the trip in that. If Dr. Kurtz had a
'phone I could get him, but he lives over on the back road, where there
isn't a line. Hurry, Rad!"

"Yes, sah, Massa Tom, I'll hurry!"

The colored man knew how to get the monoplane in shape for a flight, as
he had often done it.

Tom found his father in no immediate danger, but Mr. Swift had had a
slight recurrence of his heart trouble, and it was thought best to have
a doctor. So Tom started off in his air craft, rising swiftly above the
housetop, and sailed off toward the old-fashioned residence of Dr.
Kurtz, a sturdy, elderly German physician, who sometimes attended Mr.
Swift. Tom decided that as long as Dr. Gladby did not answer his
'phone, he could not be at home, and this, he learned later, was the
case, the physician being in a distant town on a consultation.

"My, this Butterfly seems big and clumsy beside my Humming-Bird," mused
Tom as he slid along through the air, now flying high and now low,
merely for practice. "This machine can go, but wait until I have my new
one in the air! Then I'll show 'em what speed is!"

He was soon at the physician's house, and found him in.

"Won't you ride back with me in the monoplane?" asked Tom. "I'm anxious
to have you see dad as soon as you can.

"Vot! Me drust mineself in one ob dem airships? I dinks not!" exclaimed
Dr. Kurtz ponderously. "Vy, I vould not efen ride in an outer-mobile,
yet, so vy should I go in von contrivance vot is efen more dangerous?
No, I gomes to your fader in der carriage, mit mine old Dobbin horse.
Dot vill not drop me to der ground, or run me up a tree, yet! Vot?"

"Very well," said Tom, "only hurry, please."

The young inventor, in his airship, reached home some time before the
slow-going doctor got there in his carriage. Mr. Swift was no worse,
Tom was glad to find, though he was evidently quite ill.

"So, ve must take goot care of him," said the doctor, when he had
examined the patient. "Dr. Gladby he has done much for him, und I can
do little more. You must dake care of yourself, Herr Swift, or you
vill--but den, vot is der use of being gloomy-minded? I am sure you
vill go more easy, und not vork so much."

"I haven't worked much," replied the aged inventor. "I have only been
helping my son on a new airship."

"Den dot must stop," insisted the doctor. "You must haf gomplete
rest--dot's it--gomplete rest."

"We'll do just as you say, doctor," said Tom. "We'll give up the
aeroplane matters, dad, and go away, you and I, where we can't see a
blueprint or a pattern, or hear the sound of machinery. We'll cut it
all out."

"Dot vould he goot," said Dr. Kurtz ponderously.

"No, I couldn't think of it," answered Mr. Swift. "I want you to go in
that race, Tom--and win!"

"But I'll not do it, dad, if you're going to be ill."

"He is ill now," interrupted the doctor. "Very ill, Dom Swift."

"That settles it. I don't go in the race. You and I'll go away, dad--to
California, or up in Canada. We'll travel for your health."

"No! no!" insisted the old inventor gently. "I will be all right. Most
of the work on the monoplane is done now, isn't it, Tom?"

"Yes, dad."

"Then you go on, and finish it. You and Mr. Jackson can do it without
me now. I'll take a rest, doctor, but I want my son to enter that race,
and, what's more, I want him to win!"

"Vell, if you don't vork, dot is all I ask. I must forbid you to do any
more. Mit Dom, dot is different. He is young und strong, und he can
vork. But you--not, Herr Swift, or I doctor you no more." And the
physician shook his big head.

"Very well. I'll agree to that if Tom will promise to enter the race,"
said the inventor.

"I will," said Tom.

The physician took his leave shortly after that, the medicine he gave
to Mr. Swift somewhat relieving him. Then the young inventor, who felt
in a little better spirits, went back to his workshop.

"Poor dad," he mused. "He thinks more of me and this aeroplane than he
does of himself. Well, I will go in the race, and I'll--yes, I'll win!"
And Tom looked very determined.

He was about to resume work on his craft when something about the way
one of the forward planes was tilted attracted his attention.

"I never left it that way," mused Tom. "Some one has been in here. I
wonder if it was Mr. Jackson?"

Tom stepped to the door and called for Eradicate. The colored man came
from the direction of the garden, which he was still weeding.

"Has Mr. Jackson been around, Rad?" asked the lad.

"No, sah. I ain't seed him."

"Have you been in here, looking at the Humming-Bird?"

"No, Massa Tom. I nebber goes in dere, lessen as how yo' is dere. Dem's
yo' orders."

"That's so, Rad. I might have known you wouldn't go in. But did you see
any one enter the shop?"

"Not a pusson, sab."

"Have you been here all the while?"

"All but jes' a few minutes, when I went to de barn to put some
liniment on Boomerang's so' foot."

"H'm! Some one might have slipped in here while I was away," mused Tom.
"I ought to have locked the doors, but I was in a hurry. This thing is
getting on my nerves. I wonder if it's Andy Foger, or some one else,
who is after my secret?"

He made a hasty examination of the shop, but could discover nothing
more wrong, except that one of the planes of the Humming-Bird had been
shifted.

"It looks as if they were trying to see how it was fastened on, and how
it worked," mused Tom. "But my plans haven't been touched, and no
damage has been done. Only I don't like to think that people have been
in here.  They may have stolen some of my ideas. I must keep this place
locked night and day after this."

Tom spent a busy week in making improvements on his craft. Mr. Swift
was doing well, and after a consultation by Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Gladby it
was decided to adopt a new style of treatment. In the meanwhile, Mr.
Swift kept his promise, and did no work. He sat in his easy-chair, out
in the garden, and dozed away, while Tom visited him frequently to see
if he needed anything.

"Poor old dad!" mused the young inventor. "I hope he is well enough to
come and see me try for the ten-thousand-dollar prize--and win it! I
hope I do; but if some one builds, from my stolen plans, a machine on
this model, I'll have my work cut out for me." And he gazed with pride
on the Humming-Bird.

For the past two weeks Tom had seen nothing of Andy Foger. The
red-haired bully seemed to have dropped out of sight, and even his
cronies, Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey, did not know where he had gone.

"I hope he has gone for good," said Ned Newton, who lived near Andy.
"He's an infernal nuisance. I wish he'd never come back to Shopton."

But Andy was destined to come back.

One day, when Tom was busy installing a wireless apparatus on his new
aeroplane, he heard Eradicate hurrying up the path that led to the shop.

"I wonder if dad is worse?" thought Tom, that always being his first
idea when he knew a summons was coming for him. Quickly be opened the
door.

"Some one's comin' out to see you, Massa Tom," said the colored man.

"Who is it?" asked the lad, taking the precaution to put his precious
plans out of sight.

"I dunno, sah; but yo' father knows him, an' he said fo' me to come out
heah, ahead ob de gen'man, an' tell yo' he were comin'. He'll be right
heah."

"Oh, well, if dad knows him, it's all right. Let him come, Rad."

"Yes, sah. Heah he comes." And the colored man pointed to a figure
advancing down the gravel path. Tom watched the stranger curiously.
There was something familiar about him, and Tom was sure he had met him
before, yet he could not seem to place him.

"How are you, Tom Swift?" greeted the newcomer pleasantly. "I guess
you've forgotten me, haven't you?" He held out his hand, which Tom
took.  "Don't know me, do you?" he went on.

"Well, I'm afraid I've forgotten your name," admitted the lad, just a
bit embarrassed. "But your face is familiar, somehow, and yet it isn't."

"I've shaved off my mustache," went on the other. "That makes a
difference. But you haven't forgotten John Sharp, the balloonist, whom
you rescued from Lake Carlopa, and who helped you build the Red Cloud?
You haven't forgotten John Sharp, have you, Tom?"

"Well, I should say not!" cried the lad heartily. "I'm real glad to see
you. What are you doing around here? Come in. I've got something to
show you," and he motioned to the shop where the Humming-Bird was
housed.

"Oh, I know what it is," said the veteran balloonist.

"You do?"

"Yes. It's your new aeroplane. In fact, I came to see you about it."

"To see me about it?"

"Yes. I'm one of the committee of arrangements for the meet to be held
at Eagle Park, where I understand you are going to contest. I came to
see how near you were ready, and to get you to make a formal entry of
your machine. Mr. Gunmore sent me."

"Oh, so you're in with them now, eh?" asked Tom. "Well, I'm glad to
know I've got a friend on the committee. Yes, my machine is getting
along very well. I'll soon be ready for a trial flight. Come in and
look at it. I think it's a bird--a regular Humming-Bird!" And Tom
laughed.

"It certainly is something new," admitted Mr. Sharp as his eyes took in
the details of the trim little craft. "By the way, Shopton is going to
be well represented at the meet."

"How is that? I thought I was the only one around here to enter an
aeroplane."

"No. We have just received an entry from Andy Foger."

"From Andy Foger!" gasped Tom. "Is he going to try to win some of the
prizes?"

"He's entered for the big one, the ten-thousand-dollar prize," replied
the balloonist. "He has made formal application to be allowed to
compete, and we have to accept any one who applies. Why, do you object
to him, Tom?"

"Object to him? Mr. Sharp, let me tell you something. Some time ago a
set of plans of my machine here were stolen from my house. I suspected
Andy Foger of taking them, but I could get no proof. Now you say he is
building a machine to compete for the big prize. Do you happen to know
what style it is?"

"It's a small monoplane, something like the Antoinette, his application
states, though he may change it later."

"Then he's stolen my ideas, and is making a craft like this!" exclaimed
Tom, as he sank upon a bench, and gazed from the balloonist to the
Humming-Bird, and back to Mr. Sharp again. "Andy Foger is trying to
beat me with my own machine!"




Chapter Seven

Seeking a Clue


John Sharp was more than surprised at the effect his piece of
information had on Tom Swift. Though the young inventor had all along
suspected Andy of having the missing plans, yet there had been no
positive evidence on this point. That, coupled with the fact that the
red-haired bully had not been seen in the vicinity of Shopton lately,
had, in a measure, lulled Tom's suspicions to rest, but now his hope
had been rudely shattered.

"Do you really think that's his game?" asked Mr. Sharp.

"I'm sure of it," replied the youth. "Though where he is building his
aeroplane I can't imagine, for I haven't seen him in town. He's away."

"Are you sure of that?"

"Well, not absolutely sure," replied Tom. "It's the general rumor that
he's out of town."

"Well, old General Rumor is sometimes a person not to be relied upon,"
remarked the balloonist grimly. "Now this is the way I size it up: Of
course, all I know officially is that Andy Foger has sent in an entry
for the big race for the ten-thousand-dollar prize which is offered by
the Eagle Park Aviation Association. I'm a member of the arrangements
committee, and so I know. I also know that you and several others are
going to try for the prize. That's all I am absolutely sure of.

"Now, when you tell me about the missing plans, and you conclude that
Andy is doing some underhanded work, I agree with you. But I go a step
farther. I don't believe he's out of town at all."

"Why not?" exclaimed Tom.

"Because when he has an airship shed right in his own backyard, where,
you tell me, he once made a craft in which he tried to beat you out in
the trip to Alaska, when you think of that, doesn't it seem reasonable
that he'd use that same building in which to make his new craft?"

"Yes, it does," admitted Tom slowly, "but then everybody says he's out
of town."

"Well, what everybody says is generally not so. I think you'll find
that Andy is keeping himself in seclusion, and that he's working
secretly in his shop, building a machine with which to beat you."

"Do you, really?"

"I certainly do. Have you been around his place lately?"

"No. I've been too busy; and then I never have much to do with him."

"Then take my advice, and see if you can't get a look inside that shop.
You may see something that will surprise you. If you find that Andy is
infringing on your patented ideas, you can stop him by an injunction.
You've got this model patented, I take it?"

"Oh, yes. I didn't have at the time the plans were stolen, but I've
patented it since. I could get at him that way."

"Then take my advice, and do it. Get a look inside that shed, and
you'll find Andy working secretly there, no matter if his cronies do
think he's out of town."

"I believe I will," agreed Tom, and somehow he felt better now that he
had decided on a plan of action. He and the balloonist talked over at
some length just the best way to go about it, for the young inventor
recalled the time when he and Ned Newton had endeavored to look into
Andy's shed, with somewhat disastrous results to themselves; but Tom
knew that the matter at stake justified a risk, and he was willing to
take it.

"Well, now that's settled," said Mr. Sharp, "tell me more about
yourself and your aeroplane. My! To think that the Red Cloud was
destroyed! That was a fine craft."

"Indeed she was," agreed Tom. "I'm going to make another on similar
lines, some day, but now all my time is occupied with the Humming-Bird."

"She is a hummer, too," complimented Mr. Sharp. "But I almost forgot
the real object of my trip here. There is no doubt about you going in
the race, is there?"

"I fully expect to," replied Tom. "The only thing that will prevent me
will be--"

"Don't say you're worried on account of what Andy Foger may do,"
interrupted Mr. Sharp.

"I'm not. I'll attend to Andy, all right. I was going to say that my
father's illness might interfere. He's not well at all. I'm quite
worried about him."

"Oh, I sincerely hope he'll be all right," remarked the balloonist. "We
want you in this race. In fact, we're going to feature you, as they say
about the actors and story-writers. The committee is planning to do
considerable advertising on the strength of Tom Swift, the well-known
young inventor, being a contestant for the ten-thousand-dollar prize."

"That's very nice, I'm sure," replied Tom, "and I'm going to do my
best.  Perhaps dad will take a turn for the better. He wants me to win
as much as I want to myself. Well, we'll not worry about it, anyhow,
until the time comes. I want to show you some new features of my latest
aeroplane."

"And I want to see them, Tom. Don't you think you're making a mistake,
though, in equipping it with a wireless outfit?"

"Why so?"

"Well, because it will add to the weight, and you want such a small
machine to be as light as possible."

"Yes, but you see I have a very light engine. That part my father
helped me with. In fact, it is the lightest air-cooled motor made, for
the amount of horsepower it develops, so I can afford to put on the
extra weight of the wireless outfit. I may need to signal when I am
flying along at a hundred miles an hour."

"That's so. Well, show me some of the other good points. You've
certainly got a wonderful craft here."

Tom and Mr. Sharp spent some time going over the Humming-Bird and in
talking over old times. The balloonist paid another visit to Mr. Swift,
who was feeling pretty good, and who expressed his pleasure in seeing
his old friend again.

"Can't you stay for a few days?" asked Tom, when Mr. Sharp was about to
leave. "If you wait long enough you may be able to help me work up the
clues against Andy Foger, and also witness a trial flight of the
Humming-Bird."

"I'd like to stay, but I can't," was the answer. "The committee will be
anxious for me to get back with my report. Good luck to you. I'll see
you at the time of the race, if not before."

Tom resolved to get right to work seeking clues against his old enemy,
Andy, but the next day Mr. Swift was not so well, and Tom had to remain
in the house. Then followed several days, during which time it was
necessary to do some important work on his craft, and so a week passed
without any information having been obtained.

In the meanwhile Tom had made some cautious inquiries, but had learned
nothing about Andy. He had no chance to interview Pete or Sam, the two
cronies, and he did not think it wise to make a bald request for
information at the Foger home.

Ned Newton could not be of any aid to his friend, as he was kept busy
in the bank night and day, working over a new set of books.

"I wonder how I can find out what I want to know?" mused Tom one
afternoon, when he had done considerable work on the Humming-Bird. "I
certainly ought to do it soon, so as to be able to stop Andy if he's
infringing on my patents. Yet, I don't see how--"

His thoughts were interrupted by hearing a voice outside the shop,
exclaiming:

"Bless my toothpick! I know the way, Eradicate, my good fellow. It
isn't necessary for you to come. As long as Tom Swift is out there,
I'll find him. Bless my horizontal rudder! I'm anxious to see what
progress he's made. I'll find him, if he's about!"

"Yes, sah, he's right in dere," spoke the colored man. "He's workin' on
dat Dragon Fly of his." Eradicate did not always get his names right.

"Mr. Damon!" exclaimed Tom in delight, at the sound of his friend's
voice. "I believe he can help me get evidence against Andy Foger. I
wonder I didn't think of it before! The very thing! I'll do it!"




Chapter Eight

The Empty Shed


"Bless my dark-lantern! Where are you, Tom?" called Mr. Damon as he
entered the dim shed where the somewhat frail-appearing aeroplane
loomed up in the semi-darkness, for it was afternoon, and rather
cloudy. "Where are you?"

"Here!" called the young inventor. "I'm glad to see you! Come in!"

"Ah! there it is, eh?" exclaimed the odd man, as he looked at the
aeroplane, for there had been much work done on it since he had last
seen it. "Bless my parachute, Tom! But it looks as though you could
blow it over."

"It's stronger than it seems," replied the lad. "But, Mr. Damon, I've
got something very important to talk to you about."

Thereupon Tom told all about Mr. Sharp's visit, of Andy's entry in the
big race, and of the suspicions of himself and the balloonist.

"And what is it you wish me to do?" asked Mr. Damon.

"Work up some clues against Andy Foger."

"Good! I'll do it! I'd like to get ahead of that bully and his father,
who once tried to wreck the bank I'm interested in. I'll help you, Tom!
I'll play detective! Let me see--what disguise shall I assume? I think
I'll take the part of a tramp. Bless my ham sandwich! That will be the
very thing. I'll get some ragged clothes, let my beard grow again--you
see I shaved it off since my last visit--and I'll go around to the
Foger place and ask for work. Then I can get inside the shed and look
around.  How's that for a plan?"

"It might be all right," agreed Tom, "only I don't believe you're cut
out for the part of a tramp, Mr. Damon."

"Bless my fingernails! Why not?"

"Oh, well, it isn't very pleasant to go around in ragged clothes."

"Don't mind about me. I'll do it." And the odd gentleman seemed quite
delighted at the idea. He and Tom talked it over at some length, and
then adjourned to the house, where Mr. Swift, who had seemed to improve
in the last few days, was told of the plan.

"Couldn't you go around after evidence just as you are?" asked the aged
inventor. "I don't much care for this disguising business."

"Oh, it's very necessary," insisted Mr. Damon earnestly. "Bless my
gizzard! but it's very necessary. Why, if I went around the Foger place
as I am now, they'd know me in a minute, and I couldn't find out what I
want to know."

"Well, if you keep on blessing yourself," said Tom, with a laugh,
"they'll know you, no matter what disguise you put on, Mr. Damon."

"That's so," admitted the eccentric gentleman. "I must break myself of
that habit. I will. Bless my topknot! I'll never do it any more. Bless
my trousers buttons!"

"I'm afraid you'll never do it!" exclaimed Tom.

"It is rather hard," said Mr. Damon ruefully, as he realized what he
had said. "But I'll do it. Bless--"

He paused a moment, looked at Tom and his father, and then burst into a
laugh. The habit was more firmly fastened on him than he was aware.

For several hours Tom, his father and Mr. Damon discussed various
methods of proceeding, and it was finally agreed that Mr. Damon should
first try to learn what Andy was doing, if anything, without resorting
to a disguise.

"Then, if that doesn't work, I'll become a tramp," was the decision of
the odd character. "I'll wear the raggedest clothes I can find Bless--"
But he stopped in time.

Mr. Damon took up his residence in the Swift household, as he had often
done before, and for the next week he went and came as he pleased,
sometimes being away all night.

"It's no use, though," declared Mr. Damon at the end of the week. "I
can't get anywhere near that shed, nor even get a glimpse inside of it.
I haven't been able to learn anything, either. There are two gardeners
on guard all the while, and several times when I've tried to go in the
side gate, they've stopped me."

"Isn't there any news of Andy about town?" asked Tom. "I should think
Sam or Pete would know where he is."

"Well, I didn't ask them, for they'd know right away why I was
inquiring," said Mr. Damon, "but it seems to me as if there was
something queer going on. If Andy Foger is working in that shed of his,
he's keeping mighty quiet about it. Bless my--"

And once more he stopped in time. He was conquering the habit in a
measure.

"Well, what do you propose to do next?" asked Tom.

"Disguise myself like a tramp, and go there looking for work," was the
firm answer. "There are plenty of odd jobs on a big place such as the
Foger family have. I'll find out what I want to know, you see."

It seemed useless to further combat this resolution, and, in a few days
Mr. Damon presented a very different appearance. He had on a most
ragged suit, there was a scrubby beard on his face, and he walked with
a curious shuffle, caused by a pair of big, heavy shoes which he had
donned, first having taken the precaution to make holes in them and get
them muddy.

"Now I'm all ready," he said to Tom one day, when his disguise was
complete. "I'm going over and try my luck."

He left the house by a side door, so that no one would see him, and
started down the walk. As he did so a voice shouted:

"Hi, there! Git right out oh heah! Mistah Swift doan't allow no tramps
heah, an' we ain't got no wuk fo' yo', an' there ain't no cold
victuals.  I does all de wuk, me an' mah mule Boomerang, an' we takes
all de cold victuals, too! Git right along, now!"

"It's Eradicate. He doesn't know you," said Tom, with a chuckle.

"So much the better," whispered Mr. Damon. But the disguise proved
almost too much of a success, for seeing the supposed tramp lingering
near the house, Eradicate caught up a stout stick and rushed forward.
He was about to strike the ragged man, when Tom called out:

"That's Mr. Damon, Rad!"

"Wh--what!" gasped the colored man; and when the situation had been
explained to him, and the necessity for silence impressed upon him, he
turned away, too surprised to utter a word. He sought consolation in
the stable with his mule.

Just what methods Mr. Damon used he never disclosed, but one thing is
certain: That night there came a cautious knock on the door of the
Swift home, and Tom, answering it, beheld his odd friend.

"Well," he asked eagerly, "what luck?"

"Put on a suit of old clothes, and come with me," said Mr. Damon.
"We'll look like two tramps, and then, if we're discovered, they won't
know it was you."

"Have you found out anything?" asked Tom eagerly.

"Not yet; but I've got a key to one of the side doors of the shed, and
we can get in as soon as it's late enough so that everybody there will
be in bed."

"A key? How did you get it?" inquired the youth.

"Never mind," was the answer, with a chuckle. "That was because of my
disguise; and I haven't blessed anything to-day. I'm going to, soon,
though. I can feel it coming on. But hurry, Tom, or we may be too late."

"And you haven't had a look inside the shed?" asked the young inventor.
"You don't know what's there?"

"No; but we soon will."

Eagerly Tom put on some of the oldest and most ragged garments he could
find, and then he and the odd gentleman set off toward the Foger home.
They waited some time after getting in sight of it, because they saw a
light in one of the windows. Then, when the house was dark, they stole
cautiously forward toward the big, gloomy shed.

"On this side," directed Mr. Damon in a whisper. "The key I have opens
this door."

"But we can't see when we get inside," objected Tom. "I should have
brought a dark lantern."

"I have one of those pocket electric flashlights," said Mr. Damon.
"Bless my candlestick! but I thought of that." And he chuckled
gleefully.

Cautiously they advanced in the darkness. Mr. Damon fumbled at the lock
of the door. The key grated as he turned it. The portal swung back, and
Tom and his friend found themselves inside the shed which, of late, had
been such an object of worry and conjecture to the young inventor. What
would he find there?

"Flash the light," he called to Mr. Damon in a hoarse whisper.

The eccentric man drew it from his packet. He pressed the spring switch,
and in an instant a brilliant shaft of radiance shot out, cutting the
intense blackness like a knife. Mr. Damon flashed it on all sides.

But to the amazement of Tom and his companion, it did not illuminate
the broad white wings and stretches of canvas of an aeroplane. It only
shone on the bare walls of the shed, and on some piles of rubbish in
the corners. Up and down, to right and left, shot the pencil of light.

"There's--there's nothing here!" gasped Tom.

"I--I guess you're right!" agreed Mr. Damon "The shed is empty!"

"Then where is Andy Foger building his aeroplane?" asked Tom in a
whisper; but Mr. Damon could not answer him.




Chapter Nine

A Trial Flight


For a few moments after their exclamations of surprise Tom and Mr.
Damon did not know what else to say. They stared about in amazement,
hardly able to believe that the shed could be empty. They had expected
to see some form of aeroplane in it, and Tom was almost sure his eyes
would meet a reproduction of his Humming-Bird, made from the stolen
plans.

"Can it be possible there's nothing here?" went on Tom, after a long
pause. He could not seem to believe it.

"Evidently not," answered Mr. Damon, as he advanced toward the center
of the big building and flashed the light on all sides. "You can see
for yourself."

"Or, rather, you can't see," spoke the youth. "It isn't here, that's
sure. You can't stick an aeroplane, even as small a one as my Humming
Bird, in a corner. No; it isn't here."

"Well, we'll have to look further," went on Mr. Damon. "I think--"

But a sudden noise near the big main doors of the shed interrupted him.

"Come on!" exclaimed Tom in a whisper. "Some one's coming! They may see
us! Let's get out!"

Mr. Damon released the pressure on the spring switch, and the light
went out. After waiting a moment to let their eyes become accustomed to
the darkness, he and Tom stole to the door by which they had entered.
As they swung it cautiously open they again heard the noise near the
main portals by which Andy had formerly taken in and out the Anthony,
as he had named the aeroplane in which he and his father went to
Alaska, where, like Tom's craft, it was wrecked.

"Some one is coming in!" whispered Tom.

Hardly had he spoken when a light shone in the direction of the sound.
The illumination came from a big lantern of the ordinary kind, carried
by some one who had just entered the shed.

"Can you see who it is?" whispered Mr. Damon, peering eagerly forward;
too eagerly, for his foot struck against the wooden side wall with a
loud bang.

"Who's there?" suddenly demanded the person carrying the lantern.

He raised it high above his head, in order to cast the gleams into all
the distant corners. As he did so a ray of light fell upon his face.
"Andy Foger!" gasped Tom in a hoarse whisper.

Andy must have heard, for he ran forward just as Tom and Mr. Damon
slipped out.

"Hold on! Who are you?" came in the unmistakable tones of the
red-haired bully.

"I don't think we're going to tell," chuckled Tom softly, as he and his
friend sped off into the darkness. They were not followed, and as they
looked back they could see a light bobbing about in the shed.

"He's looking for us!" exclaimed Mr. Damon with an inward laugh. "Bless
my watch chain! But it's a good thing we got in ahead of him. Are you
sure it was Andy himself?"

"Sure! I'd know his face anywhere. But I can't understand it. Where has
he been? What is he doing? Where is he building his aeroplane? I
thought he was out of town."

"He may have come back to-night," said Mr. Damon. "That's the only one
of your questions I can answer. We'll have to wait about the rest, I'm
sure he wasn't around the house to-day, though, for I was working at
weeding the flower beds, in my disguise as a tramp, and if he was home
I'd have seen him. He must have just come back, and he went out to his
shed to get something. Well, we did the best we could."

"Indeed we did," agreed Tom, "and I'm ever so much obliged to you, Mr.
Damon."

"And we'll try again, when we get more clues. Bless my shoelaces! but
it's a relief to be able to talk as you like."

And forthwith the eccentric man began to call down so many blessings on
himself and on his belongings, no less than on his friends, that Tom
laughingly warned him that he had better save some for another time.

The two reached home safely, removed their "disguises," and told Mr.
Swift of the result of their trip. He agreed with them that there was a
mystery about Andy's aeroplane which was yet to be solved.

But Tom was glad to find that, at any rate, the craft was not being
made in Shopton, and during the next two weeks he devoted all his time
to finishing his own machine. Mr. Jackson was a valuable assistant, and
Mr. Damon gave what aid he could.

"Well, I think I'll be ready for a trial flight in another week," said
Tom one day, as he stepped back to get a view of the almost completed
Humming-Bird.

"Shall you want a passenger?" asked Mr. Damon.

"Yes, I wish you would take a chance with me. I could use a bag of
sand, not that I mean you are to be compared to that," added Tom
quickly, "but I'd rather have a real person, in order to test the
balancing apparatus.  Yes, we'll make a trial trip together."

In the following few days Tom went carefully over the aeroplane, making
some slight changes, strengthening it here and there, and testing the
motor thoroughly. It seemed to work perfectly.

At length the day of the trial came, and the Humming-Bird was wheeled
out of the shed. In spite of the fact that it was practically finished,
there yet remained much to do on it. It was not painted or decorated,
and looked rather crude. But what Tom wanted to know was how it would
fly, what control he had over it, what speed it could make, and how it
balanced. For it was, at best, very frail, and the least change in
equilibrium might be fatal.

Before taking his place in the operator's seat Tom started the motor,
and by means of a spring balance tested the thrust of the propellers.
It was satisfactory, though he knew that when the engine had been run
for some time, and had warmed up, it would do much better.

"All ready, I guess, Mr. Damon!" he called, and the odd gentleman took
his place. Tom got up into his own seat, in front of several wheels and
levers by which he operated the craft.

"Start the propeller!" he requested of Mr. Jackson, and soon the motor
was spitting fire, while the big, fan-like blades were whirring around
like wings of light. The engineer and Eradicate were holding back the
Humming-Bird.

"Let her go!" cried Tom as he turned on more gasoline and further
advanced the spark of the motor. The roar increased, the propeller
looked like a solid circle of wood, and the trim little monoplane moved
slowly across the rising ground, increasing its speed every second,
until, like some graceful bird, it suddenly rose in the air as Tom
tilted the wing tips, and soared splendidly aloft!




Chapter Ten

A Midnight Intruder


Tom Swift sent his wonderful little craft upward on a gentle slant.
Higher and higher it rose above the ground. Now it topped the trees;
now it was well over them.

On the earth below stood Mr. Swift, Mr. Jackson, Eradicate and Mrs.
Baggert. They were the only witnesses of the trial flight, and as the
aged inventor saw his son's latest design in aeroplanes circling in the
air he gave a cheer of delight. It was too feeble for Tom to hear, but
the lad, glancing down, saw his father waving his hand to him.

"Dear old dad!" thought Tom, waving in return. "I hope he's well enough
to see me win the big prize."

Tom and Mr. Damon went skimming easily through the air, at no great
speed, to be sure, for the young inventor did not want to put too
sudden a strain on his motor.

"This is glorious!" cried the odd gentleman. "I never shall have enough
of aeroplaning, Tom!"

"Nor I, either," added his companion. "But how do you like it? Don't
you think it's an improvement on my Butterfly, Mr. Damon?"

"It certainly is. You're a wonder, Tom! Look out! What are you up to?"
for the machine had suddenly swerved in a startling manner.

"Oh, that's just a new kind of spiral dip I was trying," answered Tom.
"I couldn't do that with my other machine, for I couldn't turn sharp
enough."

"Well, don't do it right away again," begged Mr. Damon, who had turned
a little white, and whose breath was coming in gasps, even though he
was used to hair-raising stunts in the frail craft of the air.

Tom did not take his machine far away, for he did not want to exhibit
it to the public yet, and he preferred to remain in the vicinity of his
home, in case of any accident. So he circled around, did figures of
eight, went up and down on long slants, took sharp turns, and gave the
craft a good tryout.

"Does it satisfy you?" asked Mr. Damon, when Tom had once more made the
spiral dip, but not at high speed.

"In a way, yes," was the answer. "I see a chance for several changes
and improvements. Of course, I know nothing about the speed yet, and
that's something that I'm anxious about, for I built this with the idea
of breaking all records, and nothing else. I know, now, that I can
construct a craft that will successfully navigate the air; in fact,
there are any number of people who can do that; but to construct a
monoplane that will beat anything ever before made is a different
thing.  I don't yet know that I have done it."

"When will you?"

"Oh, when I make some changes, get the motor tuned up better, and let
her out for all she's worth. I want to do a hundred miles an hour, at
least. I'll arrange for a speedy flight in about two weeks more."

"Then I think I will stay home," said Mr. Damon.

"No; I'll need you," insisted Tom, laughing. "Now watch. I'm going to
let her out just a little."

He did, with the result that they skimmed through the air so fast that
Mr. Damon's breath became a mere series of gasps.

"We'll have to wear goggles and mouth protectors when we really go
fast!" yelled Tom above the noise of the motor, as he slowed down and
turned about for home.

"Go fast! Wasn't that fast?" asked Mr. Damon.

Tom shook his head.

"You wait, and you'll see," he announced.

They made a good landing, and Mr. Swift hastened up to congratulate his
son.

"I knew you could do it, Tom!" he cried.

"I couldn't, though, if it hadn't been for that wonderful engine of
yours, dad! How do you feel?"

"Pretty good. Oh! but that's a fine machine, Tom!"

"It certainly is," agreed Mr. Jackson.

"It will be when I have it in better trim," admitted the young inventor
modestly.

"By golly!" cried Eradicate, who was grinning almost from ear to ear,
"I's proud oh yo', Massa Tom, an' so will mah mule Boomerang be, when I
tells him. Yes, sah, dat's what he will be--proud ob yo', Massa Tom!"

"Thanks, Rad."

"Well, some folks is satisfied with mighty little under 'em, when they
go up in the air, that's my opinion," said Mrs. Baggert.

"Why, wouldn't you ride in this?" asked Tom of the buxom housekeeper.

"Not if you was to give me ten thousand dollars!" she cried firmly.
"Oh, dear! I think the potatoes are burning!" And she rushed back into
the house.

The next day Tom started to work overhauling the Humming-Bird, and
making some changes. He altered the wing tips slightly, and adjusted
the motor, until in a thrust test it developed nearly half again as
much power as formerly.

"And I'll need it all," declared Tom as he thought of the number of
contestants that had entered the great race.

For the Eagle Park meet was to be a large and important one, and the
principal "bird-men" of the world were to have a part in it. Tom knew
that he must do his very best, and he spared no efforts to make his
monoplane come up to his ideal, which was a very exacting one.

"We'll have a real speed test to-morrow," Tom announced to Mr. Damon
one night. "I'll see what the Humming-Bird can really do. You'll come,
won't you?"

"Oh, I suppose so. Bless my insurance policy! I might as well take the
same chance you do. But if you're going to have such a nerve-racking
thing as that on the program, you'd better get to bed early and have
plenty of sleep."

"Oh, I'm not tired. I think I'll go out this evening."

"Where?"

"Oh, just around town, to see some of the fellows." But if Tom was only
going around town merely to see his male friends, why did he dress so
carefully, put on a new necktie, and take several looks in the glass
before he went out? We think you can guess, and also the girl's name.

The young inventor got in rather late, and after a visit to the
aeroplane shed, to see that all was right there, he went to bed, first
connecting up the burglar-alarm wires that guarded the doors and
windows of the aerodrome.

How long he had been asleep Tom did not know, but he was suddenly
awakened by hearing the buzzing of the alarm at the head of his bed. At
first he took it for the droning and humming of the aeroplane motor, as
he had a hazy notion, and a sort of dream, that he was in his craft.

Then, with a start, he realized what it was--the burglar alarm.

"Some one's in the shed!" he gasped.

Out of bed he leaped, drawing on his trousers and coat, and putting on
a pair of slippers, with speed worthy of a fireman. He grabbed up a
revolver and rushed from his room, pounding on the door of Mr.
Jackson's apartment in passing.

"Some one in the shed, after the Humming-Bird!" shouted Tom. "Get a
gun, and come down!"




Chapter Eleven

Tom Is Hurt


As Tom passed down the hall on his way to the side door, from which he
could more quickly reach the aeroplane shed, he saw his father coming
from his room.

"What's the matter? What is it?" asked Mr. Swift, and alarm showed on
his pale face.

"It's nothing much, dad," said the youth, as quietly as he could, for
he realized that to excite his father might have a bad effect on the
invalid.

"Then why are you in such a hurry? Why have you that revolver? I know
there is something wrong, Tom. I am going to help you!"

In his father's present weakened state Tom desired this least of all,
so he said:

"Now, never mind, dad. I thought I heard a noise out in the yard, and
I'm not going to take any chances. So I roused Mr. Jackson, and I'm
going down to see what it is. Perhaps it may only be Eradicate's mule,
Boomerang, kicking around, or it may be Rad himself, or some one after
his chickens. Don't worry. Mr. Jackson and I can attend to it. You go
back to bed, father."

Tom spoke with such assurance that Mr. Swift believed him, and retired
to his room, just as the engineer, partly dressed, came hurrying out in
response to Tom's summons. He had his rifle, and, had the invalid
inventor seen that, he surely would have worried more.

"Come on!" whispered Tom. "Don't make any noise. I don't want to excite
my father."

"What was it?" asked the engineer.

"I don't know. Burglar alarm went off, that's all I can say until we
get to the shed."

Together the two left the house softly, and soon were hurrying toward
the aeroplane shed.

"Look!" exclaimed Mr. Jackson. "Didn't you see a light just then, Tom?"

"Where?"

"By the side window of the shed?"

"No, I didn't notice it! Oh, yes! There it is! Some one is in there! If
it's Andy Foger, I'll have him arrested, sure!"

"Maybe we can't catch him."

"That's so. Andy is a pretty slippery customer. Say, Mr. Jackson, you
go around and get Eradicate, and have him bring a club. We can't trust
him with a gun. Tell him to get at the back door, and I'll wait for you
to join me, and we'll go in the front door. Then we'll have 'em between
two fires. They can't get away."

"How about the windows?"

"They're high up, and hard to open since I put the new catches on them.
Whoever got in must have forced the lock of the door. There goes the
light again!"

As Tom spoke there was seen the faint glimmer of a light. It moved
slowly about the interior of the shed, and with a peculiar bobbing
motion, which indicated that some one was carrying it.

"Go for Eradicate, and don't make any more noise than you can help in
waking him up," whispered Tom, for they were now close to the shed, and
might be heard.

Mr. Jackson slipped off in the darkness, and Tom drew nearer to the
building that housed his Humming-Bird. There was one window lower than
the others, and near it was a box, that Tom remembered having seen that
afternoon. He planned to get up on that and look in, before making a
raid to capture the intruder.

Tom raised himself up to the window. The light had been visible a
moment before he placed the box in position, but an instant later it
seemed to go out, and the place was in darkness.

"I wonder if they've gone away?" thought Tom. "I can't hear any noise."

He listened intently. It was dark and silent in the shop. Suddenly the
light flashed up brighter than before, and the young inventor caught
sight of a man walking around the new aeroplane, examining it
carefully.  He carried, as Tom could see, a large-sized electric
flash-lamp, with a brilliant tungsten filament, which gave a powerful
light.

As the youth watched, he saw the intruder place the light on a bench,
in such a position that the rays fell full upon the Humming-Bird. Then,
adjusting the spring switch so that the light would continue to glow,
the man stepped back and drew something from an inner pocket.

"I wonder what he's up to?" mused Tom. "I wish Eradicate and Mr.
Jackson would hurry back. Who can that fellow be, I wonder? I've never
seen him before, as far as I know. I thought sure it was going to turn
out to be Andy Foger!"

Tom turned around to look into the dark yard surrounding the shed. He
was anxious to hear the approach of his two allies, but there was no
sound of their footsteps.

As he turned back to watch the man he could not repress a cry of alarm,
for what the intruder had drawn from his pocket was a small hatchet,
and he was advancing with it toward the Humming-Bird!

"He's going to destroy my aeroplane!" gasped Tom, and he raised his
revolver to fire.

He did not intend to shoot at the man, but only to fire to scare him,
and thus hasten the coming of Mr. Jackson and the colored man. But
there was no need of this, for an instant later the two came running up
silently, Eradicate with a big club.

"Whar am he?" he asked in a hoarse whisper. "Let me git at him, Massa
Tom!"

"Hush!" exclaimed the young inventor. "We have no time to lose! He's in
there, getting ready to chop my aeroplane to bits! Go to the back door,
Rad, and if he tries to come out don't let him get away."

"I won't!" declared the colored man emphatically, and he shook his club
suggestively.

"Come on! We'll go in the front door," whispered Tom to the engineer.
"I have the key. We'll catch him red-handed, and hand him over to the
police."

Waiting a few seconds, to enable Eradicate to get to his place, Tom and
the engineer stole softly toward the big double doors. Every moment the
youth expected to hear the crash of the hatchet on his prize machine.
He shivered in anticipation, but the blows did not fall.

Tom pushed open the door and stepped inside, followed by Mr. Jackson.
As they did so they saw the man standing in front of the Humming-Bird.
He again raised the little hatchet, which was like an Indian tomahawk,
and poised it for an instant over the delicate framework and planes of
the air craft. Then his arm began to descend.

"Stop!" yelled Tom, and at the same time he fired in the air.

The man turned as suddenly as though a bullet had struck him, and for a
moment Tom was afraid lest he had hit him by accident; but an instant
later the intruder grabbed up his flashlight, and holding it before
him, so that its rays shone full on Tom and Mr. Jackson, while it left
him in the shadow, sprang toward them, the hatchet still in his hand.

"Look out, Tom!" cried Mr. Jackson.

"Out of my way!" shouted the man.

Bravely Tom stood his ground. He wished now that he had a club instead
of his revolver. The would-be vandal was almost upon him. Mr. Jackson
clubbed his rifle and swung it at the fellow. The latter dodged, and
came straight at Tom.

"Look out!" yelled the engineer again, but it was too late. There was
the sound of a blow, and Tom went down like a log. Then the place was
in darkness, and the sound of footsteps in rapid flight could be heard
outside the shed.

The intruder, after wounding the young inventor, had made his escape.




Chapter Twelve

Miss Nestor Calls


"What's de mattah? Shall I come in? Am anybody hurted?" yelled
Eradicate Sampson as he pounded on the rear door of the aeroplane shed.
"Let me in, Massa Tom!"

"All right! Wait a minute! I'm coming!" called Mr. Jackson. He tried to
peer through the darkness, to where a huddled heap indicated the
presence of Tom. Then he thought of the electric lights, which were run
by a storage battery when the dynamo was shut down, and a moment later
the engineer had switched on the incandescents, filling the big shed
with radiance.

"Tom, are you badly hurt?" gasped Mr. Jackson.

There was no answer, for Tom was unconscious.

"Let me in! Let me git at dat robber wif mah club!" cried the colored
man eagerly.

Knowing that he would need help in carrying Tom to the house, Mr.
Jackson hurried to the back door. He had a key to it, and it was
quicker to open it than to send Eradicate away around the shed to the
front portals.

"Whar am he?" gasped the faithful darky, as he took a firmer grasp of
his club and looked around the place. "Let me git mah hands on him!
I'll feed him t' Boomerang, when I gits froo wif him!"

"He's gone," said the engineer. "Help me look after Tom. I'm afraid
he's badly hurt."

They hastened to the unconscious lad. On one side of his head was a bad
cut, which was bleeding freely.

"Oh! he's daid! I know he's daid!" wailed Eradicate.

"Not a bit of it. He isn't dead, but he may die, if we don't get him
into the house, and have a doctor here soon," said Mr. Jackson sternly.
"Catch hold of him, Rad, and, mind, don't carry on, and get excited,
and scare Mr. Swift. Just pretend it isn't very bad, or we'll have two
patients on our hands instead of only Tom."

They managed to get the youth into the house, and, contrary to their
fears, Mr. Swift was not nearly so nervous as they had expected. Calmly
he took charge of matters, and even telephoned for Dr. Gladby himself,
while Mr. Jackson and Eradicate undressed Tom and got him to bed. Mrs.
Baggert busied herself heating water and getting things in readiness
for the doctor, who had promised to come at once.

Tom was just regaining consciousness when the physician came in, having
driven over at top speed.

"What--what happened? Did the Humming-Bird fall?" asked Tom in a
whisper, putting his hand to his head.

"No, something fell on you, I guess," said the doctor, who had been
hurriedly told of the circumstances. "But don't worry, Tom. You'll be
all right in a few days. You got a bad cut on the head, but the skull
isn't fractured, I'm glad to say. Here, now, just drink this," and he
gave Tom some medicine he had mixed in a glass.

The cut was soon dressed, and Tom felt much better, though weak and a
trifle dizzy.

"Did he hit me with the hatchet?" he asked Mr. Jackson.

"I couldn't tell," was the engineer's reply, "it all happened so
quickly. In another instant I'd have bowled him over, instead of him
landing on you, but I just missed him. He either used the hatchet, or
some blunt instrument."

"Well, don't talk about it now," urged the doctor. "I want Tom to get
quiet and go to sleep. He'll be much better in the morning, but I must
forbid any aeroplane flights." And he shook his finger at Tom in
warning. "You'll have to lie quiet for several days," he added.

"All right," agreed the young inventor weakly, and then he dozed off,
for the physician had given him a quieting medicine.

"Haven't you any idea who it was?" asked Dr. Gladby of Mr. Jackson, as
he prepared to leave.

"Not the slightest. It was no one Tom or I had ever seen before. But
whoever it was, he intended to destroy the Humming-Bird, that was
evident!"

"The scoundrel! I'm glad you foiled him in time; but it's too bad about
Tom. However, we'll soon have him all right again."

"I knows who done it!" broke in Eradicate, who was a sort of privileged
character about the Swift home.

"Who?" asked Mr. Jackson.

"It were dat Andy Foger. Leastways, he send dat man heah t' make
mincemeat oh de Hummin'-Bird. I's positib 'bout dat, so I am!" And
Eradicate grinned triumphantly.

"Well, perhaps Andy did have a hand in it," admitted Mr. Swift, "but we
have no proof of it, I can't see what his object would be in wanting to
destroy Tom's new craft."

"Pure meanness. Afraid that Tom will beat him in the race," suggested
Mr. Jackson.

"It's too big a risk to take," went on the aged inventor. "I'm inclined
to think it might be one of the gang of men who made the diamonds in
the cave in the mountains. They might have sent a spy on East, and he
might try to damage the aeroplane to be revenged for what Tom and Mr.
Jenks did to them."

"It's possible," agreed the engineer. "Well, we'll wait until Tom can
talk, and we'll go over it with him."

"Not until he is stronger, though," stipulated the physician as he went
away. "Don't excite Tom for a few days."

The young inventor was much better the following day, and when Dr.
Gladby called he said Tom could sit up for a little while. Two days
later Tom was well enough to be talked to, and his father and Mr.
Jackson went over all the details of the matter. Mr. Damon, who had
returned home, came to see his friend as soon as he heard of his
plight, and was also a member of the consulting party.

"Bless my dictionary!" exclaimed the eccentric man. "I wish I had been
here to take a hand in it. But, Tom, do you believe it was one of the
diamond-making gang?"

"I hardly think so," was the reply. "They would take some other means
of revenge than by destroying my new aeroplane. I'm inclined to think
it was some one who is in with Andy Foger."

"Then we'll hire detectives, and locate him and them," declared Mr.
Damon, blessing several things in succession.

Tom, however, did not like that plan, and it was decided to do nothing
right away. In another few days Tom was able to be up, though he was
still a semi-invalid, not venturing out of the house.

It was one afternoon, when, rather tired of his confinement, he was
wishing he could resume work on his air craft, that Mrs. Baggert came
in, and said:

"Some one to see you, Tom."

"Is it Mr. Damon?"

"No, it's a lady. She--"

"Oh, Tom! How are you?" cried a girlish voice, and Mary Nestor walked
into the room, holding out both hands to the young inventor. Tom, with
a blush, arose hastily.

"No! no! Sit still!" commanded the girl. "Oh! I'm so sorry to hear
about your accident! In fact, I only heard this morning. We've been
away, mamma and I, and we just got back. Tell me all about it, that is,
if you feel able. But don't exert yourself. Oh! I wish I had hold of
that man!"

And Miss Nestor clenched her two pretty little hands and set her white,
even teeth grimly together, as though she would do most desperate
things indeed.

"I wish you did, too!" exclaimed Tom. "That is, so you could hold him
until I had a chance at him. But I'm all right now. It was very good of
you to call. How are you, and how are your folks?"

"Very well. But I came to hear about you. Tell me," and she looked
anxiously at Tom, while Mrs. Baggert discreetly withdrew to the
adjoining room, and made a great noise, rattling papers and moving
chairs about.

Thereupon Tom told what had happened, while Mary Nestor listened
interestedly and with expressions of fear at times.

"But if Andy had anything to do with it," concluded Tom, "I can't
understand what his object is. Andy is acting very strangely lately. We
can't locate him, nor find out where he is building his airship. That's
what I want to know; but Mr. Damon and I, after a lot of trouble, only
found his aeroplane shed empty."

"And you want to find out where Andy Foger is building his aeroplane
which he has entered in the big race?" asked Miss Nestor.

"That's what I'd like to know," declared Tom earnestly. "Only we can't
seem to do it. No one knows."

"Why don't you write to Mr. Sharp, or some one of the aviation meet
committee?" asked the girl simply. "They would know, for you say Andy
made his formal entry with them, and the rules require him to tell from
what city and State he will enter his craft. Write to the committee,
Tom."

For a moment the young inventor stared at her. Then he banged his fist
down on the arm of his chair.

"By Jove, Mary! That's the very thing!" he cried. "I wonder why I never
thought of that, instead of fiddling around in disguises, and things
like that? I wonder why I never thought of that plan?"

"Perhaps because it was so simple," she answered, with a pretty blush.

"I guess that's it," agreed Tom. "It takes a woman to jump across a
bridge to a conclusion every time. I'll write to Mr. Sharp at once."




Chapter Thirteen

A Clash with Andy


Tom lost no time in writing to Mr. Sharp. He wondered more and more at
his own neglect in not before having asked the balloonist, when the
latter was in Shopton, where Andy was building his aeroplane. But, as
it developed later, Mr. Sharp did not know at that time.

While waiting for a reply to his letter, Tom busied himself about his
own craft, making several changes he had decided on. He also began to
paint and decorate it, for he wanted to have the Humming-Bird present a
neat appearance when she was officially entered in the great race.

Miss Nestor called on Tom again, and Mr. Damon was a frequent visitor.
He agreed to accompany Tom to the aviation park when it was time for
the race, and also to be a passenger in the ten-thousand-dollar contest.

"It must be perfectly wonderful to fly through the air," said Miss
Nestor one day, when Tom and Mr. Damon had the Humming-Bird out on the
testing ground, trying the engine, which had been keyed up to a higher
pitch of speed. "I consider it perfectly marvelous, and I can't imagine
how it must seem to skim along that way."

"Come and try it," urged Tom suddenly. "There's not a bit of danger.
Really there isn't."

"Oh! I'd never dare do it!" replied the girl, with a gasp. "That
machine is too swift by name and swift by nature for me."

"Why don't you take Miss Nestor on a grass-cutting flight, Tom?"
suggested Mr. Damon. "Bless my lawn mower! but she wouldn't be
frightened at that."

"Grass cutting?" repeated the girl. "What in the world does that mean?"

"It means skimming along a few feet up in the air," answered the young
inventor, who had now fully recovered from the effects of the blow
given him by the midnight intruder. In spite of many inquiries, no
clues to his identity had been obtained.

"How high do you go when you 'cut grass,' as you call it?" asked Miss
Nestor, and Tom thought he detected a note of eager curiosity in her
voice.

"Not high at all," he said. "In fact, sometimes I do cut off the tops
of tall daisies. Come, Mary! Won't you try that? I know you'll like it,
and when you've been over the lawn a few times you'll be ready for a
high flight. Come! there's no danger."

"I--I almost believe I will," she said hesitatingly. "Will you take me
down when I want to come?"

"Of course," said Tom. "Get in, and we'll start."

The Humming-Bird was all ready for a trial flight, and Tom was glad of
the chance to test it, especially with such a pretty passenger as was
Miss Nestor.

"Bless my shoelaces!" cried Mr. Damon. "I can see where I am going to
be cut out, Tom Swift. I'll not get many more rides with you now that
Miss Nestor is taking to aeroplaning, you young rascal!" And he
playfully shook his finger at Tom.

"Oh, I don't expect to get enthusiastic over it," said Miss Nestor,
who, now that she had taken her place in one of the small seats under
the engine, appeared as if she would be glad of the chance to change
her mind. But she did not.

"Now, if you take me more than five feet up in the air, I'll never
speak to you again, Tom Swift!" she exclaimed.

"Five feet it shall be, unless you yourself ask to go higher," was the
youth's reply, as he winked at Mr. Damon. Well he knew the fascination
of aeroplaning, and he was almost sure of what would happen. "You can
take a tape measure along, and see for yourself," he added to his fair
passenger. "The barograph will hardly register such a little height."

"Well, it's as high as I want to go," said the girl. "Oh!" with a
scream, as Tom started the propeller. "Are we going?"

"In a moment," was his reply. He took his seat beside the girl. The
motor was speeded up until it sounded like the roar of the ocean surf
in a storm.

"Let her go!" cried Tom to Mr. Damon and Mr. Jackson, who were holding
back the Humming-Bird. They gave her a slight shove to over-come the
inertia, and the trim little craft darted across the ground at every
increasing speed.

Miss Nestor caught her breath with a gasp, glanced at Tom, and noted
how cool he was, and then her frantic grip of the uprights slightly
relaxed.

"We'll go up a little way in a minute!" shouted Tom in her ear as they
were speeding over the level ground.

He pulled a lever slightly, and the Humming-Bird rose a little in the
air, but only for a short distance, not more than five feet, and Tom
held her there, though he had to run the engine at a greater speed than
would have been the case had he been in the sustaining upper currents.
It was as if the Humming-Bird resented being held so closely to the
earth.

Around in a big circle, back and forth went the craft, at no time being
more than seven feet from the ground. Tom glanced at Miss Nestor. Her
cheeks were unusually red, and there was a bright sparkle in her eyes.

"It's glorious!" she cried. "Do you--do you think there's any danger in
going higher? I believe I'd like to go up a bit."

"I knew it!" cried Tom. "Up we go!" And he pulled the wind-bending
plane lever toward him. Upward shot the craft, as if alive.

"Oh!" gasped Mary.

"Sit still! It's all right!" commanded Tom.

"It's glorious; glorious!" she cried. "I'm not a bit afraid now!"

"I knew you wouldn't be," declared the young inventor, who had
calculated on the fascination which the motion through the air,
untrammeled and free, always produces. "Shall we go higher?"

"Yes!" cried Miss Nestor, and she gazed fearlessly down at the earth,
which was falling away from beneath their feet. She was in the grip of
the air, and it was a new and wonderful sensation.

Tom went up to a considerable distance, for, once a person loses his
first fright, one hundred feet or one thousand feet elevation makes
little difference to him. It was this way with Miss Nestor.

Now, indeed, could Tom demonstrate to her some of the fine points of
navigation in the upper currents, and though he did no risky "stunts,"
he showed the girl what it means to do an ascending spiral, how to cut
corners, how to twist around in the figure eight, and do other things.
Tom did not try for the great speed of which he knew his craft was
capable, for he knew there was some risk with Miss Nestor aboard. But
he did nearly everything else, and when he sent the Humming-Bird down
he had made another convert and devotee to the royal sport of
aeroplaning.

"Oh! I never would have dared believe I could do it!" exclaimed the girl,
as with flushed cheeks and dancing eyes she dismounted from the seat.
"Mamma and papa will never believe I did it!"

"Bring them over, and I'll take them for a flight," said Tom, with a
laugh, as Mary departed.

Tom received an answer to his letter to Mr. Sharp that night.

"Andy Foger's entry blank states," wrote the balloonist, "that he is
constructing his aeroplane in the village of Hampton, which is about
fifty miles from your place. If there is anything further I can do for
you, Tom, let me know. I will see you at the meet. Hope you win the
prize."

"In Hampton, eh?" mused Tom. "So that's where Andy has been keeping
himself all this while. His uncle lives there, and that's the reason
for it. He wanted to keep it a secret from me, so he could use my
stolen plans for his craft. But he shan't do it! I'll go to Hampton!"

"And I'll go with you!" declared Mr. Damon, who was with Tom when he
got the note from the balloonist. "We'll get to the bottom of this
mystery after a while, Tom."

Delaying a few days, to make the final changes in his aeroplane, Tom
and Mr. Damon departed for Hampton one morning. They thought first of
going in the Butterfly, but as they wanted to keep their mission as
secret as possible, they decided to go by train, and arrive in the town
quietly and unostentatiously. They got to Hampton late that afternoon.

"What's the first thing to be done?" asked Mr. Damon as they walked up
from the station, where they were almost the only persons who alighted
from the train.

"Go to the hotel," decided Tom. "There's only one, I was told, so
there's not much choice."

Hampton was a quiet little country town of about five thousand
inhabitants, and Tom soon learned the address of Mr. Bentley, Andy's
uncle, from the hotel clerk.

"What business is Mr. Bentley in?" asked Tom, for he wanted to learn
all he could without inquiring of persons who might question his
motives.

"Oh, he's retired," said the clerk. "He lives on the interest of his
money. But of late he's been erecting some sort of a building on his
back lot, like a big shed, and folks are sort of wondering what he's
doing in it. Keeps mighty secret about it. He's got a young fellow
helping him."

"Has he got red hair?" asked Tom, while his heart beat strangely fast.

"Who? Mr. Bentley? No. His hair's black."

"I mean the young fellow."

"Oh! his? Yes, his is red. He's a nephew, or some relation to Mr.
Bentley. I did hear his name, but I've forgotten it. Sandy, or Andy, or
some such name as that."

This was near enough for Tom and Mr. Damon, and they did not want to
risk asking any more questions. They turned away to go to their rooms,
as the clerk was busy answering inquiries from some other guests. A
little later, supper was served, and Tom, having finished, whispered to
Mr. Damon to join him upstairs as soon as he was through.

"What are you going to do?" asked the eccentric man.

"We're going out and have a look at this new shed by moonlight,"
decided Tom. "I want to see what it's like, and, if possible, I want to
get a peep inside. I'll soon be able to tell whether or not Andy is
using my stolen plans."

"All right. I'm with you. Bless my bill of fare! But we seem to be
doing a lot of mysterious work of late."

"Yes," agreed Tom. "But if you have to bless anything to-night, Mr.
Damon, please whisper it. Andy, or some of his friends, may be about
the shed, and as soon as they hear one of your blessings they'll know
who's coming."

"Oh, I'll be careful," promised Mr. Damon.

"Andy will find out, sooner or later, that we are in town," went on
Tom, "but we may be able to learn to-night what we want to know, and
then we can tell how to act."

A little later, as if they were merely strolling about, Mr. Damon and
Tom headed for Mr. Bentley's place, which was on the outskirts of the
town. There was a full moon, and the night was just right for the kind
of observation Tom wanted to make. There were few persons abroad, and
the young inventor thought he would have no one spying on him.

They located the big house of Andy's uncle without trouble. Going down
a side street, they had a glimpse of a shed, built of new boards,
standing in the middle of a large lot. About the structure was a new,
high wooden fence, but as Tom and his friend passed along it they saw
that a gate in it was open.

"I'm going in!" whispered Tom.

"Will it be safe?" asked Mr. Damon.

"I don't care whether it will be or not. I've got to know what Andy is
doing. Come on! We'll take a chance!"

Cautiously they entered the enclosure. The big shed was dark, and stood
out conspicuously in the moonlight.

"There doesn't seem to be any one here," whispered Tom. "I wonder if we
could get a look in the window?"

"It's worth trying, anyhow," agreed Mr. Damon. "I'm with you, Tom."

They drew nearer to the shed. Suddenly Tom stepped on a stick, which
broke with a sharp report.

"Bless my spectacles!" cried Mr. Damon, half aloud.

There was silence for a moment, and then a voice cried out:

"Who's there? Hold on! Don't come any farther! It's dangerous!"

Tom and Mr. Damon stood still, and from behind the shed stepped Andy
Foger and a man.

"Oh! it's you, is it, Tom Swift?" exclaimed the red-haired bully. "I
thought you'd come sneaking around. Come on, Jake! We'll make them wish
they'd stayed home!" And Andy made a rush for Tom.




Chapter Fourteen

The Great Test


"Bless my gizzard!" exclaimed Mr. Damon, who hardly knew what to do.
"We'd better be getting out of here, Tom!"

"Not much!" exclaimed the young inventor. "I never ran from Andy Foger
yet, and I'm not going to begin now."

He assumed an attitude of defense, and stood calmly awaiting the
onslaught of the bully; but Andy knew better than to come to a personal
argument with Tom, and so the red-haired lad halted some paces off. The
man, who had followed young Foger, also stopped.

"What do you want around here, Tom Swift?" demanded Andy.

"You know very well what I want," said the young inventor, calmly. "I
want to know what you did with the aeroplane plans you took from my
house."

"I never took any!" declared Andy vigorously.

"Well, there's no use discussing that," went on Tom. "What I came here
to find out, and I don't mind telling you, is whether or not you are
building a monoplane to compete against me, and building it on a model
invented by me; and what's more, Andy Foger, I intend to find this out,
too!"

Tom started toward the big shed, which loomed up in the moonlight.

"Stand back!" cried Andy, getting in Tom's way. "I can build any kind
of an aeroplane I like, and you can't stop me!"

"We'll see about that," declared the young inventor, as he kept on.
"I'm not going to allow my plans to be stolen, and a monoplane made
after them, and do nothing about it."

"You keep away!" snarled Andy, and he grabbed Tom by the shoulder and
struck him a blow in the chest. He must have been very much excited, or
otherwise he never would have come to hostilities this way with Tom,
whom he well knew could easily beat him.

The blow, together with the many things he had suffered at Andy's
hands, was too much for our hero. He drew back his fist, and a moment
later Andy Foger was stretched out on the grass. He lay there for a
moment, and then rose up slowly to his knees, his face distorted with
rage.

"You--you hit me!" he snarled.

"Not until you hit first," said Tom calmly.

"Bless my punching bag! That's so!" exclaimed Mr. Damon.

"You'll suffer for this!" whined Andy, getting to his feet, but taking
care to retreat from Tom, who stood ready for him. "I'll get square
with you for this! Jake, come on, and we'll get our guns!"

Andy turned and hurried back toward the shed, followed by the
evil-looking man, who had apparently been undecided whether to attack
Mr. Damon or Tom. Now the bully and his companion were in full retreat.

"We'll get our guns, and then we'll see whether they'll want to stay
where they're not wanted!" went on Andy, threateningly.

"Bless my powderhorn! What had we better do?" asked Mr. Damon.

"I guess we'd better go back," said Tom calmly. "Not that I'm afraid of
Andy. His talk about guns is all bluff; but I don't want to get into
any more of a row, and he is just ugly and reckless enough to make
trouble.  I'm afraid we can't learn what we came to find out, though
I'm more convinced than ever that Andy is using my plans to make his
aeroplane."

"But what can you do?"

"I'll see Mr. Sharp, and send a protest to the aviation committee. I'll
refuse to enter if Andy flies in a model of my Humming-Bird, and I'll
try to prevent him from using it after he gets it on the ground. That
is all I can do, it seems, lacking positive information. Come on, Mr.
Damon. Let's get back to our hotel, and we'll start for home in the
morning."

"I have a plan," whispered the odd man.

"What is it?" asked Tom, narrowly watching for the reappearance of Andy
and the man.

"I'll stay here until they come, then I'll pretend to run away. They'll
chase after me, and get all excited, and you can go up and look in the
shed windows. Then you can join me later. How's that?"

"Too risky. They might fire at you by mistake. No. We'll both go. I've
found out more than enough to confirm my suspicions."

They turned out of the lot which contained the shed, and walked toward
the road, just as Andy and his crony came back.

"Huh! You'd better go!" taunted the bully.

Tom had a bitter feeling in his heart. It seemed as if he was defeated,
and he did not like to retreat before Andy.

"You'd better not come back here again, either," went on Andy.

Tom and Mr. Damon did not reply, but kept on in silence. They returned
to Shopton the next day.

"Well," remarked Tom, when he had gone out to look at his Humming-Bird,
"I know one thing. Andy Foger may build a machine something like this,
but I don't believe he can put in all the improvements I have, and
certainly he can't equal that engine; eh, dad?"

"I hope not, Tom," replied his father, who seemed to be much improved
in health.

"When are you going to try for speed?" asked Mr. Damon.

"To-morrow, if I can get it tuned up enough," replied Tom, "and I think
I can. Yes, we'll have the great test to-morrow, and then I'll know
whether I really have a chance for that ten thousand dollars."

Never before had Tom been so exacting in his requirements of his air
craft as when, the next day, the Humming-Bird was wheeled out to the
flight ground, and gotten ready for the test. The young inventor went
over every bolt, brace, stay, guy wire and upright. He examined every
square inch of the wings, the tips, planes and rudders. The levers, the
steering wheel, the automatic equilibrium attachments and the balancing
weights were looked at again and again.

As for the engine, had it been a delicate watch, Tom could not have
scrutinized each valve, wheel, cam and spur gear more carefully. Then
the gasoline tank was filled, the magneto was looked after, the oil
reservoirs were cleaned out and freshly filled, and finally the lad
remarked:

"Well, I guess I'm ready. Come along, Mr. Damon."

"Am I going with you in the test?"

"Surely. I've been counting on you. If you're to be with me in the
race, you want to get a sample of what we can do. Take your place. Mr.
Jackson, are you ready to time us?"

"All ready, Tom."

"And, dad, do you feel well enough to check back Mr. Jackson's results?
I don't want any errors."

"Oh, yes, Tom. I can do it."

"Very well, then. Now this is my plan. I'm going to mount upward on an
easy slant, and put her through a few stunts first, to warm up, and see
that everything is all right. Then, when I give the signal, by dropping
this small white ball, that means I'm ready for you to start to time
me.  Then I'll begin to try for the record. I'll go about the course in
a big ellipse, and--well, we'll see what happens."

While Mr. Damon was in his seat the young inventor started the
propeller, and noted the thrust developed. It was satisfactory, as
measured on the scale, and then Tom took his place.

"Let her go!" he cried to Mr. Jackson and Eradicate, after he had
listened to the song of the motor for a moment. The Humming-Bird flew
across the course, and a moment later mounted into the air.

Tom quickly took her up to about two thousand feet, and there, finding
the conditions to his liking, he began a few evolutions designed to
severely test the craft's stability, and to learn whether the engine
was working properly.

"How about it?" asked Mr. Damon anxiously.

"All right!" shouted Tom in his ear, for the motor was making a great
racket. "I guess we'll make the trial next time we come around. Get
ready to drop the signal ball."

Tom slowly brought the aeroplane around in a graceful curve. He sighted
down, and saw the first tall white pole that marked the beginning of
the course.

"Drop!" he called to Mr. Damon.

The white rubber ball went to the earth like a shot. Mr. Jackson and
Mr. Swift saw it, and started their timing-watches. Tom opened the
throttle and advanced the spark. The great test was on!

The Humming-Bird trembled and throbbed with the awful speed of the
motor, like a thing alive. She seemed to rush forward as an eagle
dropping down from a dizzy height upon some hapless prey.

"Faster yet!" murmured Tom. "We must go faster yet!"

The motor was warming up. Streaks of fire came from it. The exhaust of
the explosions was a continuous roar. Faster and faster flew the frail
craft.

Around and around the air course she circled. The wind appeared to be
rushing beneath the planes and rudders with the velocity of a
hurricane.  Had it not been for the face protectors they wore, Tom and
Mr. Damon could not have breathed. For ten minutes this fearful speed
was kept up.  Then Tom, knowing he had run the motor to the limit,
slowed it down.  Next he shut it off completely, and prepared to
volplane back to earth.  The silence after the terrific racket was
almost startling. For a moment neither of the aviators spoke. Then Mr.
Damon said:

"Do you think you did it, Tom?"

"I don't know. We'll soon find out. They'll have the record." And he
motioned toward the earth, which they were rapidly nearing.




Chapter Fifteen

A Noise in the Night


"Well, did I make it? Make any kind of a record?" asked Tom eagerly, as
he brought the trim little craft to a stop, after it had rolled along
the ground on the bicycle wheels.

"What do you think you did?" asked Mr. Jackson, who had been busy
figuring on a slip of paper.

"Did I get her up to ninety miles an hour?" inquired Tom eagerly. "If I
did, I know when the motor wears down a bit smoother that I can make
her hit a hundred in the race, easily. Did I touch ninety, Mr. Jackson?"

"Better than that, Tom! Better than that!" cried his father.

"Yes," joined in Mr. Jackson. "Allowing for the difference in our
watches, Tom, your father and I figure that you did the course at the
rate of one hundred and twelve miles an hour!"

"One hundred and twelve!" gasped the young inventor, hardly able to
believe it.

"I made it a hundred and fifteen," said Mr. Swift, who was almost as
pleased as was his son, "and Mr. Jackson made it one hundred and
eleven; so we split the difference, so to speak. You certainly have a
sky racer, Tom, my boy!"

"And I'll need it, too, dad, if I'm to compete with Andy Foger, who may
have a machine almost like mine."

"But I thought you were going to object to him if he has," said Mr.
Damon, who had hardly recovered from the speedy flight through space.

"Well, I was just providing for a contingency, in case my protest was
overruled," remarked Tom. "But I'm glad the Humming-Bird did so well on
her first trial. I know she'll do better the more I run her. Now we'll
get her back in her 'nest,' and I'll look her over, when she cools
down, and see if anything has worked loose."

But the trim little craft needed only slight adjustments after her
tryout, for Tom had built her to stand up under a terrific strain.

"We'll soon be in shape for the big race," he announced, "and when I
bring home that ten thousand dollars I'm going to abandon this
sky-scraping business, except for occasional trips."

"What will you do to occupy your mind?" asked Mr. Damon.

"Oh, I'm going to travel," announced Tom. "Then there's my new electric
rifle, which I have not perfected yet. I'll work on that after I win
the big race."

For several days after the first real trial of his sky racer Tom was
busy going over the Humming-Bird, making slight changes here and there.
He was the sort of a lad who was satisfied with nothing short of the
best, and though neither his father nor Mr. Jackson could see where
there was room for improvement, Tom was so exacting that he sat up for
several nights to perfect such little details as a better grip for the
steering-lever, a quicker way of making the automatic equilibriumizer
take its position, or an improved transmitter for the wireless
apparatus.

That was a part of his monoplane of which Tom was justly proud, for
though many aeroplanes to-day are equipped with the sending device, few
can receive wireless messages in mid-air. But Tom had seen the
advantage of this while making a trip in the ill-fated Red Cloud to the
cave of the diamond makers, and he determined to have his new craft
thus provided against emergencies. The wireless outfit of the
Humming-Bird was a marvel of compactness.

Thus the days passed, with Tom very busy; so busy, in fact, that he
hardly had time to call on Miss Nestor. As for Andy Foger, he heard no
more from him, and the bully was not seen around Shopton. Tom concluded
that he was at his uncle's place, working on his racing craft.

The young inventor sent a formal protest to the aviation committee, to
be used in the event of Andy entering a craft which infringed on the
Humming-Bird, and received word from Mr. Sharp that the interests of
the young inventor would be protected. This satisfied Tom.

Still, at times, he could not help wondering how the first plans had so
mysteriously disappeared, and he would have given a good deal to know
just how Andy got possession of them, and how he knew enough to use
them.

"He, or some one whom he hired, must have gotten into our house mighty
quickly that day," mused Tom, "and then skipped out while dad fell into
a little doze. It was a mighty queer thing, but it's lucky it was no
worse."

The time was approaching for the big aviation meet. Tom's craft was in
readiness, and had been given several other trials, developing more
speed each time. Additional locks were put on the doors of the shed,
and more burglar-alarm wires were strung, so that it was almost a
physical impossibility to get into the Humming-Bird's "nest" without
arousing some one in the Swift household.

"And if they do, I guess we'll be ready for them," said Tom grimly. He
had been unable to find out who it was that had attempted once before
to damage the monoplane, but he suspected it was the ill-favored man
who was working with Andy.

As for Mr. Swift, at times he seemed quite well, and again he required
the services of a physician.

"You will have to be very careful of your father, Tom," said Dr.
Gladby.  "Any sudden shock or excitement may aggravate his malady, and
in that case a serious operation will be necessary."

"Oh, we'll take good care of him," said the lad; but he could not help
worrying, though he tried not to let his father see the strain which he
was under.

It was some days after this, and lacking about a week until the meet
was to open, when a peculiar thing happened. Tom had given his
Humming-Bird a tryout one day, and had then begun to make arrangements
for taking it apart and shipping it to Eagle Park. For he would not fly
to the meet in it, for fear of some accident. So big cases had been
provided.

"I'll take it apart in the morning," decided Tom, as he went to his
room, after seeing to the burglar alarm, "and ship her off. Then Mr.
Damon and I will go there, set her up, and get ready to win the race."

Tom had opened all the windows in his room, for it was very warm. In
fact it was so warm that sleep was almost out of the question, and he
got up to sit near the windows in the hope of feeling a breeze.

There it was more comfortable, and he was just dozing off, and
beginning to think of getting back into bed, when he was aware of a
peculiar sound in the air overhead.

"I wonder if that's a heavy wind starting up?" he mused. "Good luck, if
it is! We need it." The noise increased, sounding more and more like
wind, but Tom, looking out into the night, saw the leaves of the trees
barely moving.

"If that's a breeze, it's taking its own time getting here," he went on.

The sound came nearer, and then Tom knew that it was not the noise of
the wind in the trees. It was more like a roaring and rumbling.

"Can it be distant thunder?" Tom asked himself. "There is no sign of a
storm." Once more he looked from the window. The night was calm and
clear--the trees as still as if they were painted.

The sound was even more plain now, and Tom, who had sharp ears, at once
decided that it was just over the house--directly overhead. An instant
later he knew what it was.

"The motor of an aeroplane, or a dirigible balloon!" he exclaimed.
"Some one is flying overhead!"

For an instant he feared lest the shed had been broken into, and his
Humming-Bird taken, but a glance toward the place seemed to show that
it was all right.

Then Tom hastily made his way to where a flight of stairs led to a
little enclosed observatory on the roof.

"I'm going to see what sort of a craft it is making that noise," he
said.

As he opened the trap door, and stepped out into the little observatory
the sound was so plain as to startle him. He looked up quickly, and,
directly overhead he saw a curious sight.

For, flying so low as to almost brush the lightning rod on the chimney
of the Swift home, was a small aeroplane, and, as Tom looked up, he saw
in a light that gleamed from it, two figures looking down on him.




Chapter Sixteen

A Mysterious Fire


For a few moments Tom did not know what to think. Not that the sight of
aeroplanes in flight were any novelty to him, but to see one flying
over his house in the dead of night was a little out of the ordinary.
Then, as he realized that night-flights were becoming more common, Tom
tried to make out the details of the craft.

"I wish I had brought the night glasses with me," he said aloud.

"Here they are," spoke a voice at his side, and so suddenly that Tom
was startled. He looked down, and saw Mr. Jackson standing beside him.

"Did you hear the noise, too?" the lad asked the engineer.

"Yes. It woke me up. Then I heard you moving around, and I heard you
come up here. I thought maybe it was a flight of meteors you'd come to
see, and I knew the glasses would be handy, so I stopped for them. Take
a look, Tom. It's an aeroplane; isn't it?"

"Yes, and not moving very fast, either. They seem to be circling around
here."

The young inventor was peering through the binoculars, and, as soon as
he had the mysterious craft in focus, he cried:

"Look, Mr. Jackson, it's a new kind of monoplane. I never saw one like
it before. I wonder who could have invented that? It's something like a
Santos-Dumont and a Bleriot, with some features of Cornu's Helicopter.
That's a queer machine."

"It certainly is," agreed the engineer, who was now sighting through
the glasses. In spite of the darkness the binoculars brought out the
peculiarities of the aeroplane with considerable distinctness.

"Can you make out who are in it?" asked Tom.

"No," answered Mr. Jackson. "You try."

But Tom had no better luck. There were two persons in the odd machine,
which was slowly flying along, moving in a great circle, with the Swift
house for its center.

"I wonder why they're hanging around here?" asked Tom, suspiciously.

"Perhaps they want to talk to you," suggested Mr. Jackson. "They may be
fellow inventors--perhaps one of them is that Philadelphia man who had
the Whizzer."

"No," replied the lad. "He would have sent me word if he intended
calling on me. Those are strangers, I think. There they are, coming
back again."

The mysterious aeroplane was once more circling toward the watchers on
the roof. There was a movement on the steps, near which Tom was
standing, and his father came up.

"Is anything the matter?" he asked anxiously.

"Only a queer craft circling around up here," was the reply. "Come and
see, dad."

Mr. Swift ascended to the roof. The aeroplane was higher now, and those
in her could not so easily be made out. Tom felt a vague sense of fear,
as though he was being watched by the evil eyes of his enemies. More
than once he looked over to the shed where his craft was housed, as
though some danger might threaten it. But the shed of the Humming-Bird
showed no signs of invaders.

Suddenly the mysterious aeroplane increased its speed. It circled about
more quickly, and shot upward, as though to show the watchers of what
it was capable. Then, with a quick swoop it darted downward, straight
for the building where Tom's newest invention was housed.

"Look out! They'll hit something!" cried the young inventor, as though
those in the aeroplane could hear him.

Then, just as though they had heeded his warning, the pilots of the
mysterious craft shot her upward, after she had hovered for an instant
over the big shed.

"That was a queer move," said Tom. "It looked as if they lost control
of her for a moment."

"And they dropped something!" cried Mr. Jackson. "Look! something fell
from the aeroplane on the roof of the shed."

"Some tool, likely," spoke Tom. "I'll get it in the morning, and see
what sort of instruments they carry. I'd like to examine that machine,
though."

The queer aeroplane was now shooting off in the darkness and Tom
followed it with the glasses, wondering what its construction could be
like. He was to have another sight of it sooner than he expected.

"Well, we may as well get back to bed," said Mr. Jackson. "I'm tired,
and we've got lots to do to-morrow."

"Yes," agreed Tom. "It's cooler now. Come on, dad."

Tom fell into a light doze. He thought afterward he could not have
slept more than half an hour when he heard a commotion out in the yard.
For an instant he could not tell what it was, and then, as he grew
wider awake he knew that it was the shouting of Eradicate Sampson, and
the braying of Boomerang.

But what was Eradicate shouting?

"Fire! Fire! Fire!"

Tom leaped to his window.

"Wake up, Massa Tom! Wake up! De areoplane shed am on fire, an' de
Humming-Bird will burn up! Hurry! Hurry!"

Tom looked out. Flames were shooting up from the roof of the shed where
his precious craft was kept.




Chapter Seventeen

Mr. Swift is Worse


Almost before the echoes of Eradicate's direful warning cry had died
away, Tom was on his way out of the house, pausing only long enough to
slip on a pair of shoes and his trousers. There was but one thought in
his mind. If he could get the Humming-Bird safely out he would not care
if the shed did burn, even though it contained many valuable tools and
appliances.

"We must save my new aeroplane!" thought Tom, desperately. "I've got to
save her!"

As he raced through the hall he caught up a portable chemical
fire-extinguisher. Tom saw his father's door open, and Mr. Swift looked
out.

"What is it?" he called anxiously.

"Fire!" answered the young inventor, almost before he thought of the
doctor's warning that Mr. Swift must not be excited. Tom wished he
could recall the word, but it was too late. Besides Eradicate, down in
the yard was shouting at the top of his voice:

"Fire! Fire! Fire!"

"Where, Tom?" gasped Mr. Swift, and his son thought the aged inventor
grew suddenly paler.

"Aeroplane shed," answered the lad. "But don't worry dad. It's only a
small blaze. We'll get it out. You stay here. We'll attend to it--Mr.
Jackson and Eradicate and I."

"No--I'm going to help!" exclaimed Mr. Swift, sturdily. "I'll be with
you, Tom. Go on!"

The lad rushed down to the yard, closely followed by the engineer, who
had caught up another extinguisher. Eradicate was rushing about, not
knowing what to do, but still keeping up his shouting.

"It's on de roof! De roof am all blazin'!" he yelled.

"Quit your noise, and get to work!" cried Tom. "Get out a ladder, Rad,
and raise it to the side of the shed. Then play this extinguisher on
the blaze. Mr. Jackson, you help me run the Humming-Bird out. After
she's safe we'll tackle the fire."

Tom cast a hurried look at the burning shed. The flames were shooting
high up from the roof, now, and eating their way down. As he rushed
toward the big doors, which he intended to open to enable him to run
out his sky racer, he was wondering how the fire came to start so high
up as the roof. He wondered if a meteor could have fallen and caused it.

As the doors, which were quickly unlocked by Tom, swung back, and as he
and the engineer started to go in, they were met by choking fumes as if
of some gas. They recoiled for the moment.

"What--what's that?" gasped Tom, coughing and sneezing.

"Some chemical--I--I don't know what kind," spluttered Mr. Jackson.
"Have you any carboys of acid in there Tom, that might have exploded by
the heat?"

"No; not a thing. Let's try again."

Once more they tried to go in, but were again driven back by the
distressing fumes. The fire was eating down, now. There was a hole
burned in the roof, and by the leaping tongues of flame Tom could see
his aeroplane. It was almost in the path of the blaze.

"We must get her out!" he shouted. "I'm going in!"

But it was impossible, and the daring young inventor nearly succumbed
to the choking odors. Mr. Jackson dragged him back.

"We can't go in!" he cried. "There has been some mysterious work here!
Those fumes were put here to keep us from saving the machine. This fire
has been set by some enemy! We can't go in!"

"But I am going!" declared Tom. "We'll try the back door."

They rushed to that, but again were driven out by the gases and vapors,
which were mingled with the smoke. Disheartened, yet with a wild desire
to do something to save his precious craft, Tom Swift drew back for a
moment.

As he did so he heard a hiss, as Eradicate turned the chemical stream
on the blaze. Tom looked up. The faithful colored man was on a ladder
near the burning roof, acting well his part as a fireman.

"That's the stuff!" cried Tom. "Come on, Mr. Jackson. Maybe if we use
the chemical extinguishers we can drive out those fumes!"

The engineer understood. He took up the extinguisher he had brought,
and Tom got a second one from a nearby shed. Then Mr. Swift came out
bearing another.

"You shouldn't have come, dad! We can attend to it!" cried Tom, fearing
for the effect of the excitement on his invalid parent.

"Oh, I couldn't stay there and see the shed burn. Are you getting it
under control? Why don't you run out the Humming-Bird?"

Tom did not mention the choking fumes. He passed up a full extinguisher
to Eradicate, who had used all the chemical in his. Then Tom got
another ladder, and soon three streams were being directed on the
flames. They had eaten, a pretty big hole in the roof, but the
chemicals were slowly telling on them.

As soon as he saw that Eradicate and Mr. Jackson could control the
blaze, Tom descended to the ground, and ran once more to the big doors.
He was determined to make another try to wheel out the aeroplane, for
he saw from above that the flames were now on the side wall, and might
reach the craft any minute. And it would not take much to inflict
serious damage on the sky racer.

"I'll get her, fumes or no fumes!" murmured Tom, grimly. And, whether
it was the effect of the chemical streams, or whether the choking odors
were dissipated through the hole in the roof was not manifested, but,
at any rate, Tom found that he could go in, though he coughed and
gasped for breath.

He wheeled the aeroplane outside, for the Humming-Bird was almost as
light as her namesake. A hurried glance by the gleam of the dying fire
assured Tom that his craft was not damaged beyond a slight scorching of
one of the wing tips.

"That was a narrow escape!" he murmured, as he wheeled the sky racer
far away, out of any danger from sparks. Then he went back to help
fight the fire, which was extinguished in about ten minutes more.

"It was a mighty queer blaze," said Mr. Jackson, "starting at the top
that way. I wonder what caused it?"

"We'll investigate in the morning," decided Tom. "Now, dad, you must
get back to your room." He turned to help his father in, but at that
moment Mr. Swift, who was trying to say something, fell over in a dead
faint.

"Quick! Help me carry him into the house!" cried Tom. "Then telephone
for Dr. Gladby, Mr. Jackson."

The physician looked grave when, half an hour later, he examined his
patient.

"Mr. Swift is very much worse," he said in a low voice. "The excitement
of the fire has aggravated his ailment. I would like another doctor to
see him, Tom."

"Another doctor?" Tom's voice showed his alarm.

"Yes, we must have a consultation. I think Dr. Kurtz will be a good one
to call in. I should like his opinion before I decide what course to
take."

"I'll send Eradicate for him at once," said the young inventor, and he
went to give the colored man his instructions, while his heart was
filled with a great fear for his father.




Chapter Eighteen

The Broken Bridge


Dr. Kurtz looked as grave as did Dr. Gladby when he had made an
examination of the patient. Mr. Swift was still in a semi-conscious
condition, hardly breathing as he rested on the bed where they had
placed him after the fire.

"Vell," said the German physician, after a long silence, "vot is your
obinion, my dear Gladby?"

"I think an operation is necessary."

"Yes, dot is so; but you know vot kind of an operation alone vill safe
him; eh, my dear Gladby?"

Dr. Gladby nodded.

"It will be a rare and delicate one," he said. "There is but one
surgeon I know of who can do it."

"You mean Herr Hendrix?" asked Dr. Kurtz.

"Yes, Dr. Edward Hendrix, of Kirkville. If he can be induced to come I
think there is a chance of saving Mr. Swift's life. I'll speak to Tom
about it."

The two physicians, who had been consulting together, summoned the
youth from another room, where, with Mrs. Baggert and Mr. Jackson he
had been anxiously awaiting the verdict.

"What is it?" the young inventor asked Dr. Gladby.

The medical man told him to what conclusion he and his colleague had
arrived, adding:

"We advise that Dr. Hendrix be sent for at once. But I need hardly tell
you, Tom, that he is a noted specialist, and his services are in great
demand. He is hard to get."

"I'll pay him any sum he asks!" burst out the youth. "I'll spend all my
fortune--and I have made considerable money of late--I'll spend every
cent to get my father well! Money need not stand in the way, Dr.
Gladby."

"I knew that, Tom. Still Dr. Hendrix is a very busy man, and it is hard
to induce him to come a long distance. It is over a hundred miles to
Kirkville, and it is an out-of-the-way place. I never could understand
why Dr. Hendrix settled there. But there he is, and if we want him he
will have to come from there. The worst of it is that there are few
trains, and only a single railroad line from there to Shopton."

"Then I'll telegraph," decided Tom. "I'll offer him his own price, and
ask him to rush here as soon as he can."

"You had better let Dr. Kurtz and me attend to that part of it,"
suggested the physician. "Dr. Hendrix would hardly come on the request
of some one whom he did not know. I'll prepare a telegram, briefly
explaining the case. It is the sort of an operation Dr. Hendrix is much
interested in, and I think he will come on that account, if for no
other reason. I'll write out the message, and you can have Eradicate
take it to the telegraph office."

"I'll take it myself!" exclaimed Tom, as he got ready to go out into
the night with the urgent request. "Is there any immediate danger for
my father?" he asked.

"No; not any immediate danger," replied Dr. Gladby. "But the operation
is imperative if he is to live. It is his one and only chance."

Tom thought only of his father as he hurried on through the night. Even
the prospect of the great race, so soon to take place, had no part in
his mind.

"I'll not race until I'm sure dad is going to get better," he decided.
With the message to the noted specialist Tom also sent one to Mr.
Damon, telling him the news, and asking him to come to Shopton. Tom
felt that the presence of the odd gentleman would help him, and Mr.
Damon, who first intended to stay on at the Swift home until he and Tom
departed for Eagle Park, had gone back to his own residence to attend
to some business Tom knew he would come in the morning, and Mr. Damon
did arrive on the first train.

"Bless my soul!" he exclaimed with ready sympathy, as he extended his
hand to Tom. "What's all this?" The young inventor told him, beginning
with the fire that had been the cause of the excitement which produced
the change in Mr. Swift.

"But I have great hopes that the specialist will be able to cure him,"
said Tom, for, with the coming of daylight, his courage had returned to
him. "Dr. Gladby and Dr. Kurtz depend a great deal on Dr. Hendrix," he
said.

"Yes, he certainly is a wonderful man. I have heard a great deal about
him. I have no doubt but what he will cure your father. But about the
fire? How did it start?"

"I don't know, but now that I have a few hours to spare before the
doctor can get here, I'm going to make an examination."

"Bless my penwiper, but I'll help you."

Tom went into the house, to inquire of Mrs. Baggert, for probably the
tenth time that morning, how his father was doing. Mr. Swift was still
in a semi-conscious condition, but he recognized Tom, when the youth
stood at his bedside.

"Don't worry about me, son," said the brave old inventor, as he took
Tom's hand. "I'll be all right. Go ahead and get ready for the race. I
want you to win!"

Tears came into Tom's eyes. Would his father be well enough to allow
him to take part in the big event? He feared not.

By daylight it was seen that quite a hole had been burned in the
aeroplane shed. Tom and Mr. Damon, accompanied by Mr. Jackson, walked
through the place.

"And you say the fire broke out right after you had seen the mysterious
airship hovering over the house?" asked the eccentric man.

"Well, not exactly after," answered Tom, "but within an hour or so. Why
do you ask?"

But Mr. Damon did not answer. Something on the floor of the shed, amid
a pile of blackened and charred pieces of wood, attracted his
attention.  He stooped over and picked it up.

"Is this yours?" he asked Tom.

"No. What is it?"

The object looked like a small iron ball, with a tube about half an
inch in diameter projecting slightly from it. Tom took it.

"Why, it looks like an infernal machine or a dynamite bomb," he said.
"I wonder where it came from? Guess I'd better drop it in a pail of
water.  Maybe Eradicate found it and brought it here. I never saw it
before. Mr. Jackson, please hand me that pail of water. We'll soak this
bomb."

"There is no need," said Mr. Damon, quietly. "It is harmless now. It
has done its work. It was that which set fire to your shed, and which
caused the stifling fumes."

"That?" cried Tom.

"Yes. This ball is hollow, and was filled with a chemical. It was
dropped on the roof, and, after a certain time, the plug in the tube
was eaten through, the chemicals ran out, set the roof ablaze, and,
dripping down inside spread the choking odors that nearly prevented you
from getting out your aeroplane."

"Are you sure of this?" asked the young inventor.

"Positive. I read about these bombs recently. A German invented them to
be used in attacking a besieged city in case of war."

"But how did this one get on my shed roof?" asked Tom.

"It was dropped there by the mysterious airship!" exclaimed the odd
man.  "That was why the aeroplane moved about over your place. Those in
it hoped that the fire would not break out until you were all asleep,
and that the shed and the Humming-Bird would be destroyed before you
came to the rescue. Some of your enemies are still after you, Tom."

"And it was Andy Foger, I'll wager!" he cried. "He was in that
aircraft!  Oh, I'll have a long score to settle with him!"

"Of course you can't be sure it was he," said Mr. Damon, "but I
wouldn't be a bit surprised but what it was. Andy is capable of such a
thing. He wanted to prevent you from taking part in the race."

"Well, he sha'n't!" cried Tom, and then he thought of his invalid
father. They made a further examination of the shed, and discovered
another empty bomb. Then Tom recalled having seen something drop from
the mysterious aeroplane as it passed over the shed.

"It was these bombs," he said. "We certainly had a narrow escape! Oh,
wait until I settle my score with Andy Foger!"

As there would be but little use for the aeroplane shed now, if Tom
sent his craft off to the meet, it was decided to repair it temporarily
only, until he returned.

Accordingly, a big tarpaulin was fastened over the hole in the roof.
Then Tom put a new wing tip on in place of the one that had been
scorched. He looked all over his sky racer, and decided that it was in
fit condition for the coming meet.

"I'll begin to take it apart for shipment, as soon as I hear from the
specialist that dad is well enough for me to go," he said.

It was a few hours after the discovery of the empty bomb that Tom saw
Dr. Gladby coming along. The physician was urging his horse to top
speed. Tom felt a vague fear in his heart.

"I've got a message from Dr. Hendrix, Tom," he said, as he stopped his
carriage, and approached the lad.

"When can he come?" asked the young inventor, eagerly.

"He can't get here, Tom."

"Can't get here! Why not?"

"Because the railroad bridge has collapsed, and there is no way to
come.  He can't make any other connections to get here in time--in time
to do your father any good, Tom. He has just sent me a telegram to that
effect. Dr. Hendrix can't get here, and..." Dr. Gladby paused.

"Do you mean that my father may die if the operation is not performed?"
asked Tom, in a low voice.

"Yes," was the answer.

"But can't Dr. Hendrix drive here in an auto?" asked the lad. "Surely
there must be some way of getting over the river, even if the railroad
bridge is down. Can't he cross in a boat and drive here?"

"He wouldn't be in time, Tom. Don't you understand, Dr. Hendrix must be
here within four hours, if he is to save your father's life. He never
could do it by driving or by coming on some other road, or in an auto.
He can't make the proper connections. There is no way."

"Yes, there is!" cried Tom, suddenly. "I know a way!"

"How?" asked Dr. Gladby, thrilled by Tom's ringing tones. "How can you
do it, Tom?"

"I'll go for Dr. Hendrix in my Humming-Bird."

"Going for him would do no good. He must be brought here."

"And so he shall be!" cried Tom. "I'll bring him here in my sky
racer--if he has the nerve to stand the journey, and I think he has!
I'll bring Dr. Hendrix here!" and Tom hurried away to prepare for the
thrilling trip.




Chapter Nineteen

A Nervy Specialist


There was little time to lose. Every moment of delay meant so much less
chance for the recovery of Mr. Swift. Even now the periods of
consciousness were becoming shorter and farther apart. He seemed to be
sinking.

Tom resolutely refused to think of the possibility of death, as he went
in to bid his parent good-by before starting off on his trip through
the air. Mr. Swift barely knew his son, and, with tears in his eyes,
though he bravely tried to keep them back, the young inventor went out
into the yard.

There stood the Humming-Bird, with Mr. Jackson, Mr. Damon and Eradicate
working over her, to get her in perfect trim for the race before her--a
race with death.

Fortunately there was little to be done to get the speedy craft ready.
Tom had accomplished most of what was necessary, while waiting for word
from Dr. Hendrix. Now about all that needed to be done was to see that
there was plenty of gasoline and oil in the reservoirs.

"I'll give you a note to Dr. Hendrix," said Mr. Gladby, as Tom was
fastening on his faceguard. "I--I trust you won't be disappointed, Tom.
I hope he will consent to return with you."

"He's got to come," said the young inventor, simply, as if that was all
there was to it.

"Do you think you can make the trip in time?" asked Mr. Damon. "It is a
little less than a hundred miles in an airline, but you have to go and
go back. Can the aeroplane do it?"

"I'd be ashamed of her if she couldn't," said Tom, with a grim
tightening of his lips. "She's just got to do it; that's all! But I
know she will," and he patted the big propeller and the motor's shining
cylinders as though the machine was a thing alive, like a horse or a
dog, who could understand him.

He climbed to his seat, the other one holding a bag of sand to maintain
a good balance.

"Start her," ordered Tom, and Mr. Jackson twisted the propeller. The
motor caught at once, and the air throbbed with the noise of the
explosions. Tom listened to the tune of the machinery. It sang true.

"Two thousand pounds thrust!" called the engineer, as he looked at the
scale.

"Let her go!" cried Tom, whose voice was hardly heard above the roar.
The trim little aeroplane scudded over the ground, gathering speed at
every revolution of the wheels. Then with a spring like that of some
great bird launching itself in flight, she left the earth, and took to
the air. Tom was off on his trip.

Those left behind sent up a cautious cheer, for they did not want to
disturb Mr. Swift. They waved their hands to the young inventor, and he
waved his in reply. Then he settled down for one of the swiftest
flights he had ever undertaken.

Tom ascended until he struck a favorable current of air. There was a
little wind blowing in the direction he wished to take, and that aided
him. But even against a powerful head-wind the Humming-Bird could make
progress.

The young inventor saw the ground slipping backward beneath him.
Carefully he watched the various indicators, and listened intently to
the sound of the cylinders' explosions. They came rapidly and
regularly.  The motor was working well.

Tom glanced at the barograph. It registered two thousand feet, and he
decided to keep at about that height, as it gave him a good view, and
he could see to steer, for a route had been hastily mapped out for him
by his friends.

Over cities, towns, villages, scattered farmhouses; across stretches of
forest; over rivers, above big stretches of open country he flew. Often
he could see eager crowds below, gazing up at him. But he paid no heed.
He was looking for a sight of a certain broad river, which was near
Kirkville. Then he knew he would be close to his goal.

He had speeded up the motor to the limit, and there was nothing to do
now, save to manage the planes, wing tips and rudders, and to see that
the gasoline and oil were properly fed to the machine.

Faster and faster went the Humming-Bird, but Tom's thoughts were even
faster. He was thinking of many things--of his father--of what he would
do if Mr. Swift died--of the mysterious airship--of the stolen
plans--of the fire in the shed--of the great race--and of Andy Foger.

He took little note of time, and when, in less than an hour he sighted
the river that told him he was near to Kirkville, he was rather
startled.

"You certainly did come right along, Humming-Bird!" he murmured proudly.

He descended several hundred feet, and, as he passed over the town, the
people of which grew wildly excited, he looked about for the house of
the noted specialist. He knew how to pick it out, for Dr. Gladby had
described it to him, and Tom was glad to see, as he came within view of
the residence, that it was surrounded by a large yard.

"I can land almost at his door," he said, and he did, volplaning to
earth with an ease born of long practice.

To say that Dr. Hendrix was astonished when Tom dropped in on him in
this manner, would not be exactly true. The specialist was not in the
habit of receiving calls from youths in aeroplanes, but the fact was,
that Dr. Hendrix was so absorbed in his work, and thought so constantly
about it, that it took a great deal to startle him out of his usual
calm.

"And so you came for me in your aeroplane?" he asked of Tom, as he
gazed at the trim little craft. It is doubtful if he really saw it,
however, as Dr. Hendrix was just then thinking of an operation he had
performed a few hours before. "I'm sorry you had your trip for
nothing," he went on.  "I'd like very much to come to your father, but
didn't you get my telegram, telling about the broken bridge? There is
no way for me to get to Shopton in time."

"Yes, there is!" cried Tom, eagerly.

"How?"

"The same way I came--in the aeroplane! Dr. Hendrix you must go back
with me! It's the only way to save my father's life. Come with me in
the Humming-Bird. It's perfectly safe. I can make the trip in less than
an hour. I can carry you and your instruments. Will you come? Won't you
come to save my father's life?" Tom was fairly pleading now.

"A trip in an aeroplane," mused Dr. Hendrix "I've never taken such a
thing. I--"

"Don't be afraid, there's really no danger," said Tom.

The physician seemed to reach a sudden conclusion. His eyes brightened.
He walked over and looked at the little Humming-Bird. For the time
being he forgot about his operations.

"I'll go with you!" he suddenly cried. "I'll go with you, Tom Swift! If
you've got the nerve, so have I! and if my science and skill can save
your father's life, he'll live to be an old man! Wait until I get my
bag and I'll be with you!"

Tom's heart gave a bound of hope.




Chapter Twenty

Just in Time


While Dr. Hendrix was in his office, getting ready to make the
thrilling trip through the air with Tom, the young inventor spent a few
minutes going over his monoplane. The wonderful little craft had made
her first big flight in excellent time, though Tom knew she could do
better the farther she was flown. Not a stay had started, not a guy
wire was loose.  The motor had not overheated, and every bearing was as
cool as though it had not taken part in thousands of revolutions.

"Oh, I can depend on you!" murmured Tom, as he looked to see that the
propeller was tight on the shaft. He gave the bearing a slight
adjustment to make sure of it.

He was at this when the specialist reappeared. Dr. Hendrix, after his
first show of excitement, when he had made his decision to accompany
Tom, had resumed his usual calm demeanor. Once again he was the grave
surgeon, with his mind on the case before him.

"Well, is my auto ready?" he asked absentmindedly. Then, as he saw the
little aeroplane, and Tom standing waiting beside it, he added: "Oh, I
forgot for the moment that I was to make a trip through the air,
instead of in my car. Well, Mr. Swift, are we all ready?"

"All ready," replied the young inventor. "We're going to make fast
time, Dr. Hendrix. You'd better put this on," and Tom extended a face
protector.

"What's it for?" The physician looked curiously at it.

"To keep the air from cutting your cheeks and lips. We are going to
travel a hundred miles an hour this trip."

"A hundred miles an hour!" Dr. Hendrix spoke as though he would like to
back out.

"Maybe more, if I can manage it," went on Tom, calmly, as he proceeded
to remove the bag of sand from the place where the surgeon was to sit.
Then he looked to the various equilibrium arrangements and the control
levers. He was so cool about it, taking it all for granted, as if
rising and flying through the air at a speed rivaling that of the
fastest birds, was a matter of no moment, that Dr. Hendrix was
impressed by the calm demeanor of the young inventor.

"Very well," said the surgeon with a shrug of his shoulders, "I guess
I'm game, Tom Swift."

The doctor took the seat Tom pointed out to him, with his bag of
instruments on his knees. He put on the face protector, and had, at the
suggestion of our hero, donned a heavy coat.

"For it's cold in the upper regions," said Tom.

Several servants in the physician's household had gathered to see him
depart in this novel fashion, and the chauffeur of the auto, in which
the specialist usually made his calls, was also there.

"I'll give you a hand," said the chauffeur to the young inventor. "I
was at an aviation meet once, and I know how it's done."

"Good," exclaimed Tom. "Then you can hold the machine, and shove when I
give the word."

Tom started the propeller himself, and quickly jumped into his seat.
The chauffeur held back the Humming-Bird until the young aviator had
speeded up the motor.

"Let go!" cried the youthful inventor, and the man gave the little
craft a shove. Across the rather uneven ground of the doctor's yard it
ran, straight for a big iron barrier.

"Look out! We'll be into the fence!" shouted the surgeon. "We'll be
killed!" He seemed about to leap off.

"Sit still!" cried Tom, and at that instant he tilted the elevation
planes, and the craft shot upward, going over the fence like a circus
horse taking a seven-barred gate.

"Oh!" exclaimed the physician in a curious voice. They were off on
their trip to save the life of Mr. Swift.

What the sensations of the celebrated specialist were, Tom never
learned. If he was afraid, his fright quickly gave place to wonder, and
the wonder soon changed to delight as the machine rose higher and
higher, acquired more speed, and soared in the air over the country
that spread out in all directions from Kirkville.

"Magnificent! Magnificent!" murmured the doctor, and then Tom knew that
the surgeon was in the grip of the air, and was one of the "bird-men."

Every moment the Humming-Bird increased her speed. They passed over the
river near where men were working on the broken bridge. It was now no
barrier to them. Tom, noting the barograph, and seeing that they were
twenty-two hundred feet high, decided to keep at about that distance
from the earth.

"How fast are we going?" cried Dr. Hendrix, into the ear of the young
inventor.

"Just a little short of a hundred an hour!" Tom shouted back. "We'll
hit a hundred and five before long."

His prediction proved true, and when about forty miles from Shopton
that terrific speed had been attained. It seemed as if they were going
to have a trip devoid of incident, and Tom was congratulating himself
on the quick time made, when he ran into a contrary strata of air.
Almost before he knew it the Humming-Bird gave a dangerous and
sickening dive, and tilted at a terrifying angle.

"Are we going to turn turtle?" cried the doctor.

"I--I hope not!" gasped Tom. He could not understand why the
equilibrium weights did not work, but he had no time then to
investigate. Quickly he warped the wing tips and brought the craft up
on an even keel.

He gave a sigh of relief as the aeroplane was once more shooting
forward, and he was not mistaken when he thought he heard Dr. Hendrix
murmur a prayer of thankfulness. Their escape had been a narrow one.
Tom's nerve, and the coolness of the physician, had alone saved them
from a fall to death.

But now, as if ashamed of her prank, the Humming-Bird went along even
better than before. Tom was peering through the slight haze that hung
over the earth, for a sight of Shopton. At length the spires of the
churches came into view.

"There it is," he called, pointing downward. "We'll land in two minutes
more."

"No time to spare," murmured the doctor, who knew the serious nature of
the aged inventor's illness. "How long did it take us?"

"Fifty-one minutes," replied Tom, glancing at a small clock in front of
him. Then he shut off the motor and volplaned to earth, to the no small
astonishment of the surgeon. He made a perfect landing in the yard
before the shed, leaped from his seat, and called:

"Come, Dr. Hendrix!"

The surgeon followed him. Dr. Gladby and Dr. Kurtz came to the door of
the house. On their faces were grave looks. They greeted the celebrated
surgeon eagerly.

"Well?" he asked quickly, and they knew what he meant.

"You are only just in time," said Dr. Gladby, softly, and Tom,
following the doctors into the house, wondered if his trip with the
specialist had been in vain.




Chapter Twenty-One

"Will He Live?"


Soon there were busy scenes in the Swift home, as preparations were
made for a serious operation on the aged inventor. Tom's father had
sunk into deep unconsciousness, and was stretched out on the bed as
though there was no more life in him. In fact, Tom, for the moment,
feared that it was all over. But good old Dr. Kurtz, noting the look on
the lad's face, said:

"Ach, Dom, doan't vorry! Maybe it vill yet all be vell, und der vater
vill hear of der great race. Bluck up your courage, und doan't gif up.
Der greatest surgeon in der vorld is here now, und if anybody gan safe
your vater, Herr Hendriz gan. Dot vos a great drip you made--a great
drip!"

Tom felt a little comforted and, after a sight of his father, and a
silent prayer that God would spare his life for years to come, the
young inventor went out in the yard. He wanted to be busy about
something, for he knew, with the doctors, and a trained nurse who had
been hastily summoned, there was no immediate need for him. He wanted
to get his mind off the operation that would soon take place, and so he
decided to look over his aeroplane.

Mr. Damon came out when Tom was going over the guy wires and braces, to
see how they had stood the strain.

"Well, Tom, my lad," said the eccentric man, sadly, as he grasped our
hero's hand, "it's too bad. But hope for the best. I'm sure your father
will pull through. We will have to begin taking the Humming-Bird apart
soon; won't we, if we're going to ship it to Eagle Park?" He wanted to
take Tom's mind off his troubles.

"I don't know whether we will or not," was the answer, and Tom tried to
speak unbrokenly, but there was a troublesome lump in his throat, and a
mist of tears in his eyes that prevented him from seeing well. The
Humming-Bird, to him, looked as if she was in a fog.

"Nonsense! Of course we will!" cried Mr. Damon. "Why, bless my
wishbone!  Tom, you don't mean to say you're going to let that little
shrimp Andy Foger walk away with that ten-thousand-dollar prize without
giving him a fight for it; are you?"

This was just what Tom needed, and it seemed good to have Mr. Damon
bless something again, even if it was only a wishbone.

"No!" exclaimed Tom, in ringing tones. "Andy Foger isn't going to beat
me, and if I find out he is going to race with a machine made after my
stolen plans, I'll make him wish he'd never taken them."

"But if the machine he had flying over here when he dropped that bomb
on the shed roof, and set fire to it, is the one he's going to race
with, it isn't like yours," suggested Mr. Damon, who was glad he had
turned the conversation into a more cheerful channel.

"That's so," agreed the young inventor. "Well, we'll have to wait and
see." He was busy now, going over every detail of the Humming-Bird. Mr.
Damon helped him, and they discovered the defect in the equilibrium
weights, and remedied it.

"We can't afford to have an accident in the race," said Tom. He glanced
toward the house, and wondered if the operation had begun yet. He could
see the trained nurse hurrying here and there, Mrs. Baggert helping her.

Eradicate Sampson shuffled out from the stable where he kept his mule
Boomerang. On the face of the honest colored man there was a dejected
look.

"Am Massa Swift any better, Massa Tom?" he asked.

"We can't tell yet," was the answer.

"Well, if he doan't git well, den I'm goin' t' sell mah mule," went on
the dirt-chaser, from which line of activity Eradicate had derived his
name.

"Sell Boomerang! Bless my curry comb! what for?" asked Mr. Damon.

"'Case as how he wouldn't neber be any good fo' wuk any mo'," explained
Eradicate. "He's got so attached t' dis place, an' all de folkes on it,
dat he'd feel so sorry ef--ef--well, ef any ob 'em went away, dat I
couldn't git no mo' wuk out ob him, no how. So ef Massa Swift doan't
git well, den I an' Boomerang parts!"

"Well, we hope it won't happen," said Tom, greatly touched by the
simple grief of Eradicate. The young inventor was silent a moment, and
then he softly added: "I--I wonder when--when we'll know?"

"Soon now, I think," answered Mr. Damon, in a low voice.

Silently they waited about the aeroplane. Tom tried to busy himself,
but he could not. He kept his eyes fastened on the house.

It seemed like several hours, but it was not more than one, ere the
white-capped nurse came to the door and waved her hand to Tom. He
sprang to his feet and rushed forward. What would be the message he was
to receive?

He stood before the nurse, his heart madly beating. She looked gently
at him.

"Will he--will he live?" Tom asked, pantingly.

"I think so," she answered gently. "The operation is over. It was a
success, so far. Time alone will tell, now. Dr. Hendrix says you can
see your father for just a moment."




Chapter Twenty-Two

Off to the Meet


Softly Tom tiptoed into the room where his father lay. At the bedside
were the three doctors, and the nurse followed the young inventor in.
Mrs. Baggert stood in the hall, and near her was Garret Jackson. The
aged housekeeper had been weeping, but she smiled at Tom through her
tears.

"I think he's going to get well," she whispered. She always looked on
the bright side of things. Tom's heart felt better.

"You must only speak a few words to him," cautioned the specialist, who
had performed such a rare and delicate operation, near the heart of the
invalid. "He is very weak, Tom."

Mr. Swift opened his eyes as his son approached. He looked around
feebly.

"Tom--are you there?" he asked in a whisper.

"Yes, dad," was the eager answer.

"They tell me you--you made a great trip to get Dr. Hendrix--broken
bridge--came through the air with him. Is that right?"

"Yes, dad. But don't tire yourself. You must get well and strong."

"I will, Tom. But tell me; did you go in--in the Humming-Bird?"

"Yes, dad."

"How did she work?"

"Fine. Over a hundred, and the motor wasn't at its best."

"That's good. Then you can go in the big race, and win."

"No, I don't believe I'll go, dad."

"Why not?" Mr. Swift spoke more strongly.

"I--because--well, I don't want to."

"Nonsense, Tom! I know; it's on my account. I know it is. But listen to
me. I want you to go in! I want you to win that race! Never mind about
me. I'm going to get well, and I'll recover all the more quickly if you
win that race. Now promise me you'll go in it and--and--win!"

The invalid's strength was fast leaving him.

"I--I---," began Tom.

"Promise!" insisted the aged inventor, trying to rise. Dr. Hendrix made
a hasty move toward the bed.

"Promise!" whispered the surgeon to Tom.

"I--I promise!" exclaimed Tom, and the aged inventor sank back with a
smile of satisfaction on his pale face.

"Now you must go," said Dr. Gladby to Tom. "He has talked long enough.
He must sleep now, and get up his strength."

"Will he get better?" asked Tom, anxiously.

"We can't say for sure," was the answer. "We have great hopes."

"I don't want to enter the race unless I know he is going to live,"
went on Tom, as Dr. Gladby followed him out of the room.

"No one can say for a certainty that he will recover," spoke the
physician. "You will have to hope for the best, that is all, Tom. If I
were you I'd go in the race. It will occupy your mind, and if you could
send good news to your father it might help him in the fight for life
he is making."

"But suppose--suppose something happens while I am away?" suggested the
young inventor.

The doctor thought for a moment. Then he exclaimed:

"You have a wireless outfit on your craft; haven't you?"

"Yes."

"Then you can receive messages from here every hour if you wish. Garret
Jackson, your engineer, can send them, and you can pick them up in
mid-air if need be."

"So I can!" cried Tom. "I will go to the meet. I'll take the
Humming-Bird apart at once, and ship it to Eagle Park. Unless Dr.
Hendrix wants to go back in it," he added as an after thought.

"No," spoke Dr. Gladby, "Dr. Hendrix is going to remain here for a few
days, in case of an emergency. By that time the bridge will have been
repaired, and he can go back by train. I gather, from what he said,
that though he liked the air trip, he will not care for another one."

"Very well," assented Tom, and Mr. Damon and he were kept busy, packing
the Humming-Bird for shipment. Mr. Jackson helped them, and Eradicate
and his mule Boomerang were called on occasionally when boxes or crates
were to be taken to the railroad station.

In the meanwhile, Mr. Swift, if he did not improve any, at least held
his own. This the doctors said was a sign of hope, and, though Tom was
filled with anxiety, he tried to think that fate would be kind to him,
and that his father would recover. Dr. Hendrix left, saying there was
nothing more he could do, and that the rest depended on the local
physicians, and on the nurse.

"Und ve vill do our duty!" ponderously exclaimed Dr. Kurtz. "You go off
to dot bird race, Dom, und doan't vorry. Ve vill send der with-out-vire
messages to you venever dere is anyt'ing to report. Go mit a light
heart!"

How Tom wished he could, but it was out of the question. The last of
the parts of the Humming-Bird had been sent away, and our hero
forwarded a telegram to Mr. Sharp, of the arrangement committee,
stating that he and Mr. Damon would soon follow. Then, having bidden
his father a fond farewell, and after arranging with Mr. Jackson to
send frequent wireless messages, Tom and the eccentric man left for the
meet.

There was a wireless station at Eagle Park, and Tom had planned to
receive the messages from home there until he could set up his own
plant. He would have two outfits. One in the big tent where the
Humming-Bird was to be put together, and another on the machine itself,
so that when in the air, practicing, or even in the great race itself,
there would be no break in the news that was to be flashed through
space.

Tom and Mr. Damon arrived at Eagle Park on time, and Tom's first
inquiry was for a message from home. There was one, stating that Mr.
Swift was fairly comfortable, and seemed to be doing well. With
happiness in his heart, the young inventor then set about getting the
parts of his craft from the station to the park, where he and Mr.
Damon, with a trusty machinist whom Mr. Sharp had recommended, would
assemble it. Tom arranged that in his absence the wireless operator on
the grounds would take any message that came for him.

The Humming-Bird, in the big cases and boxes, had safely arrived, and
these were soon in the tent which had been assigned to Tom. It was
still several days until the opening of the meet, and the grounds
presented a scene of confusion.

Workmen were putting up grand stands, tents and sheds were being
erected, exhibitors were getting their machines in shape, and excited
contestants of many nationalities were hurrying to and fro, inquiring
about parts delayed in shipment, or worrying lest some of their pet
ideas be stolen.

Tom and Mr. Damon, with Frank Forker, the young machinist, were soon
busy in their big tent, which was a combined workshop and living
quarters, for Tom had determined to stay right on the ground until the
big race was over.

"I don't see anything of Andy Foger," remarked Mr. Damon, on the second
day of their residence in the park. "There are lots of new entries
arriving, but he doesn't seem to be on hand."

"There's time enough," replied Tom. "I am afraid he's hanging back
until the last minute, and will spring his machine so late that I won't
have time to lodge a protest. It would be just like him."

"Well, I'll be on the lookout for him. Have you heard from home to-day,
Tom?"

"No. I'm expecting a message any minute." The young inventor glanced
toward the wireless apparatus which had been set up in the tent. At
that moment there came the peculiar sound which indicated a message
coming through space, and down the receiving wires. "There's something
now!" exclaimed Tom, as he hurried over and clamped the telephone
receiver to his ear. He listened a moment.

"Good news!" he exclaimed. "Dad sat up a little to-day! I guess he's
going to get well!" and he clicked back congratulations to his father
and the others in Shopton.

Another day saw the Humming-Bird almost in shape again, and Tom was
preparing for a tryout of the engine.

Mr. Damon had gone over to the committee headquarters to consult with
Mr. Sharp about the steps necessary for Tom to take in case Andy did
attempt to enter a craft that infringed on the ideas of the young
inventor, and on his way back he saw a newly-erected tent. There was a
young man standing in the entrance, at the sight of whom the eccentric
man murmured:

"Bless my skate-strap! His face looks very familiar!"

The youth disappeared inside the tent suddenly, and, as Mr. Damon came
opposite the canvas shelter, he started in surprise.

For, on a strip of muslin which was across the tent, painted in gay
colors, were the words:


THE FOGER AEROPLANE


"Bless my elevation rudder!" cried Mr. Damon. "Andy's here at last! I
must tell Tom!"




Chapter Twenty-Three

The Great Race


"Well," remarked Mr. Sharp, when Tom and Mr. Damon had called on him,
to state that Andy Foger's machine was now on the grounds, and
demanding to be allowed to view it, to see if it was an infringement on
the one entered by the young inventor, "I'll do the best I can for you.
I'll lay the case before the committee. It will meet at once, and I'll
let you know what they say."

"Understand," said Tom, "I don't want to interfere unless I am
convinced that Andy is trying an underhand trick. My plans are missing,
and I think he took them. If his machine is made after those plans, it
is, obviously, a steal, and I want him ruled out of the meet."

"And so he shall be!" exclaimed Mr. Sharp. "Get the evidence against
him, and we'll act quickly enough."

The committee met in about an hour, and considered the case. Meanwhile,
Tom and Mr. Damon strolled past the tent with its flaring sign. There
was a man on guard, but Andy was not in sight.

Then Tom was sent for, and Mr. Sharp told him what conclusion had been
arrived at. It was this:

"Under the rules of the meet," said the balloonist, "we had to
guarantee privacy to all the contestants until such time as they choose
to exhibit their machines. That is, they need not bring them out until
just before the races," he added. "This is not a handicap affair, and
the speediest machine, or the one that goes to the greatest height,
according to which class it enters, will win. In consequence we cannot
force any contestant to declare what kind of a machine he will use
until he gets ready.

"Some are going to use the familiar type of biplanes and, as you can
see, there is no secret about them. They are trying them out now." This
was so, for several machines of this type were either in the air,
circling about, or were being run over the ground.

"But others," continued Mr. Sharp, "will not even take the committee
into their confidence until just before the race. They want to keep
their craft a secret. We can't compel them to do otherwise. I'm sorry,
Tom, but the only thing I see for you to do is to wait until the last
minute. Then, if you find Andy has infringed on your machine, lodge a
protest--that is unless you can get evidence against him before that
time."

Tom well knew the uselessness of the latter plan. He and Mr. Damon had
tried several times to get a glimpse of the craft Andy had made, but
without success. As to the other alternative--that of waiting until the
last moment--Tom feared that, too, would be futile.

"For," he reasoned, "just before the race there will be a lot of
confusion, officials will be here and there, scattered over the ground,
they will be hard to find, and it will be almost useless to protest
then. Andy will enter the race, and there is a possibility that he may
win. Almost any one could with a machine like the Humming-Bird. It's
the machine almost as much as the operator, in a case like this."

"But you can protest after the race," suggested Mr. Damon.

"That would be little good, in case Andy beat me. The public would say
I was a sorehead, and jealous. No, I've either got to stop Andy before
the race, or not at all. I will try to think of a plan."

Tom did think of several, but abandoned them one after the other. He
tried to get a glimpse inside the tent where the Foger aeroplane was
housed, but it was too closely guarded. Andy himself was not much in
evidence, and Tom only had fleeting glimpses of the bully.

Meanwhile he and Mr. Damon, together with their machinist, were kept
busy. As Tom's craft was fully protected by patents now, he had no
hesitation in taking it out, and it was given several severe tests
around the aerial course. It did even better than Tom expected of it,
and he had great hopes.

Always, though, there were two things that worried him. One was his
father's illness, and the other the uneasiness he felt as to what Andy
Foger might do. As to the former, the wireless reports indicated that
Mr. Swift was doing as well as could be expected, but his improvement
was not rapid. Regarding the latter worry, Tom saw no way of getting
rid of it.

"I've just got to wait, that's all," he thought.

The day before the opening of the meet, Tom and Mr. Damon had given the
Humming-Bird a grueling tryout. They had taken her high up--so high
that no prying eyes could time them, and there Tom had opened the motor
for all the power in it. They had flashed through space at the rate of
one hundred and twenty miles an hour.

"If we can only do that in the race, the ten thousand dollars is mine!"
exulted Tom, as he slanted the nose of the aeroplane toward the earth.

The day of the race dawned clear and beautiful. Tom was up early, for
there remained many little things to do to get his craft in final trim
for the contest. Then, too, he wanted to be ready to act promptly as
soon as Andy's machine was wheeled out, and he also wanted to get a
message from home.

The wireless arrived soon after breakfast, and did not contain very
cheering news.

"Your father not so well," Mr. Jackson sent. "Poor night, but doctor
thinks day will show improvement. Don't worry."

"Don't worry! I wonder who could help it," mused poor Tom. "Well, I'll
hope for the best," and he wired back to tell the engineer in Shopton
to keep in touch with him, and to flash the messages to the
Humming-Bird in the air, after the big race started.

"Now I'll go out and see if I can catch a glimpse of what that sneak
Andy has to pit against me," said Tom.

The Foger tent was tightly closed, and Tom turned back to his own
place, having arranged with a messenger to come and let him know as
soon as Andy's craft was wheeled out.

All about was a scene of great activity. The grand stands were filled,
and a big crowd stood about the field anxiously waiting for the first
sight of the "bird-men" in their wonderful machines. Now and then the
band blared out, and cheers arose as one after another the frail craft
were wheeled to the starting place.

Men in queer leather costumes darted here and there--they were the
aviators who were soon to risk life and limb for glory and gold. Most
of them were nervously smoking cigarettes. The air was filled with
guttural German or nasal French, while now and then the staccato
Russian was heard, and occasionally the liquid tones of a Japanese. For
men of many nations were competing for the prizes.

The majority of the machines were monoplanes and biplanes though one
triplane was entered, and there were several "freaks" as the biplane
and monoplane men called them--craft of the helicopter, or the wheel
type.  There was also one Witzig Liore Dutilleul biplane, with three
planes behind.

Tom was familiar with most of these types, but occasionally he saw a
new one that excited his curiosity. However, he was more interested in
what Andy Foger would turn out. Andy's machine had not been tried, and
Tom wondered how he dared risk flying in it, without at least a
preliminary tryout. But Andy, and those with him, were evidently full
of confidence.

News of the suspicions of Tom, and what he intended to do in case these
suspicions proved true, had gotten around, and there was quite a crowd
about his own tent, and another throng around that of Andy.

Tom and Mr. Damon had wheeled the Humming-Bird out of her canvas
"nest." There was a cheer as the crowd caught sight of the trim little
craft. The young inventor, the eccentric man, and the machinist were
busy going over every part.

Meanwhile the meet had been officially opened, and it was announced
that the preliminary event would be some air evolutions at no great
height, and for no particular prize. Several biplanes and monoplanes
took part in this. It was very interesting, but the big
ten-thousand-dollar race, over a distance of a hundred miles was the
principal feature of the meet, and all waited anxiously for this.

The opening stunts passed off successfully, save that a German operator
in a Bleriot came to grief, crashing down to the ground, wrecking his
machine, and breaking an arm. But he only laughed at that, and coolly
demanded another cigarette, as he crawled out of the tangle of wires,
planes and the motor.

After this there was an exhibition flight by a French aviator in a
Curtis biplane, who raced against one in a Baby Wright. It was a dead
heat, according to the judges. Then came a flight for height; and while
no records were broken, the crowd was well satisfied.

"Get ready for the hundred-mile ten-thousand-dollar-prize race!"
shouted the announcer, through his megaphone.

Tom's heart gave a bound. There were seven entrants in this contest
besides Tom and Andy Foger, and as announced by the starter they were
as follows:

  CONTESTANT                   MACHINE
  Von Bergen.................Wright Biplane
  Alameda..............Antoinette Monoplane
  Perique.................Bleriot Monoplane
  Loi Tong..........Santos-Dumont Monoplane
  Wendell....................Curtis Biplane
  De Tromp...................Farman Biplane
  Lascalle.............Demoiselle Monoplane
  Andy Foger.................--------------
  Tom Swift..........Humming-Bird Monoplane


"What is the style of the Foger machine?" yelled some one in the crowd,
as the announcer lowered his megaphone.

"It has not been announced," was the reply. "It will at once be wheeled
out though, in accordance with the conditions of the race."

There was a craning of necks, and an uneasy movement in the crowd, for
Tom's story was now generally known.

"Get ready to make your protest," advised Mr. Damon to the young
inventor. "I'll stay by the machine here until you come back. Bless my
radiator! I hope you beat him!"

"I will, if it's possible!" murmured Tom, with a grim tightening of his
lips.

There was a movement about Andy's tent, whence, for the last half hour
had come spasmodic noises that indicated the trying-out of the motor.
The flaps were pulled back and a curious machine was wheeled into view.
Tom rushed over toward it, intent on getting the first view. Would it
prove to be a copy of his speedy Humming-Bird?

Eagerly he looked, but a curious sight met his eyes. The machine was
totally unlike any he had expected to see. It was large, and to his
mind rather clumsy, but it looked powerful. Then, as he took in the
details, he knew that it was the same one that had flown over his house
that night--it was the one from which the fire bomb had been dropped.

He pushed his way through the crowd. He saw Andy standing near the
curious biplane, which type of air craft it nearest resembled, though
it had some monoplane features. On the side was painted the name:

           SLUGGER


Andy caught sight of Tom Swift.

"I'm going to beat you!" the bully boasted, "and I haven't a machine
like yours, after all. You were wrong."

"So I see," stammered Tom, hardly knowing what to think. "What did you
do with my plans then?"

"I never had them!"

Andy turned away, and began to assist the men he had hired to help him.
Like all the others, his machine had two seats, for in this race each
operator must carry a passenger.

Tom turned away, both glad and sorry,--glad that his rival was not to
race him in a duplicate of the Humming-Bird, but sorry that he had as
yet no track of the strangely missing plans.

"I wonder where they can be?" mused the young inventor.

Then came the firing of the preliminary gun. Tom rushed back to where
Mr. Damon stood waiting for him.

There was a last look at the Humming-Bird. She was fit to race any
machine on the ground. Mr. Damon took his place. Tom started the
propeller. The other contestants were in their seats with their
passengers. Their assistants stood ready to shove them off. The
explosions of so many motors in action were deafening.

"How much thrust?" cried Tom to his machinist.

"Twenty-two hundred pounds!"

"Good!"

The report of the starting-gun could not be heard. But the smoke of it
leaped into the air. It was the signal to go.

Tom's voice would not have carried five feet. He waved his hands as a
signal. His helper thrust the Humming-Bird forward. Over the smooth
ground it rushed. Tom looked eagerly ahead. On a line with him were the
other machines, including Andy Foger's Slugger.

Tom pulled a lever. He felt his craft soar upward. The other machines
also pointed their noses into the air.

The big race for the ten-thousand-dollar prize was under way!




Chapter Twenty-Four

Won by a Length


Rising upward, on a steep slant, for he wanted to get into the upper
currents as soon as possible, Tom looked down and off to his left and
saw one machine going over the ground in curious leaps and bounds. It
was the tiny Demoiselle--the smallest craft in the race, and its
peculiar style of starting was always thus manifested.

"I don't believe he's going to make it," thought Tom.

He was right. In another moment the tiny craft, after rising a short
distance, dove downward, and was wrecked. The young inventor saw the
two men crawling out from the tangled planes and wings, apparently
uninjured.

"One contestant less," thought Tom, grimly, though with pity in his
heart for the unfortunates.

However, he must think of himself and his own craft now. He glanced at
Mr. Damon sitting beside him. That odd gentleman, with never a thought
of blessing anything now, unless he did it silently, was watching the
lubricating system. This was a vital part of the craft, for if anything
went wrong with it, and the bearings overheated, the race would have to
be abandoned. So Tom was not trusting to any automatic arrangement, but
had instituted, almost at the last moment, a duplicate hand-worked
system, so that if one failed him he would have the other.

"A good start!" shouted Mr. Damon in his ear.

Tom nodded, and glanced behind him. On a line with the Humming-Bird,
and at about the same elevation, were the Bleriot monoplane and a
Wright biplane. Below were the Santos-Dumont and the Antoinette.

"Where's the Slugger?" called Tom to his friend.

Mr. Damon motioned upward. There, in the air above Tom's machine, and
slightly in advance, was Andy Foger's craft. He had gotten away in
better shape than had the Humming-Bird.

For a moment Tom's heart misgave him. Then he turned on more power, and
had the satisfaction of mounting upward and shooting onward until he
was on even terms with Andy.

The bully gave one glance over toward his rival, and pulled a lever.
The Slugger increased her speed, but Tom was not a second behind him.

There was a roaring noise in the rear, and up shot De Tromp in the
Farman, and Loi Tong, the little Japanese, in the Santos-Dumont. Truly
the race was going to be a hotly contested one. But the end was far off
yet.

After the first jockeying for a start and position, the race settled
down into what might be termed a "grind." The course was a large one,
but so favorable was the atmosphere that day, and such was the location
of Eagle Park in a great valley, that even on the far side of the great
ellipse the contestants could be seen, dimly with the naked eye, but
very plainly with glasses, with which many of the spectators were
provided.

Around and around they went, at no very great height, for it was
necessary to make out the signals set up by the race officials, so that
the contestants would know when they were near the finish, that they
might use the last atom of speed. So at varying heights the wonderful
machines circled about the course.

The Humming-Bird was working well, and Tom felt a sense of pride as he
saw the ground slipping away below him. He felt sure that he would win,
even when Alameda, the Spaniard, in the Antoinette, came creeping up on
him, and even when Andy Foger, with a burst of speed, placed himself
and his passenger in the lead.

"I'll catch him!" muttered Tom, and he opened the throttle a trifle
wider, and went after Andy, passing him with ease.

They had covered about thirty miles of the course, when the humming and
crackling of the wireless apparatus told Tom that a message was coming.
He snapped the receiver to his ear, adjusting the outer covering to
shut out the racket of the motor, and listened.

"Well?" asked Mr. Damon, as Tom took off the receiver.

"Dad isn't quite so well," answered the lad. "Mr. Jackson says they
have sent for Dr. Hendrix again. But dad is game. He sends me word to
go on and win, and I'll do it, too, only--"

Tom paused, and choked back a sob. Then he prepared to get more speed
out of his motor.

"Of course you will!" cried Mr. Damon. "Bless my--!"

But they encountered an adverse current of wind at that moment, and it
required the attention of both of the aviators to manage the machine.
It was soon on an even keel again, and once more was shooting forward
around the course.

At times Tom would be in advance, and again he would have to give place
to the Curtis, the Farman, or the Santos-Dumont, as these speedy
machines, favored by a spurt from their motors, or by some current of
air, shot ahead. But, in general, Tom maintained the lead, and among
the spectators there began a series of guesses as to how much he would
win by.

Tom glanced at the barograph. It registered a little over twelve
hundred feet. He looked at the speed gage. He was doing a trifle better
than a hundred miles an hour. He looked down at the signals. There was
twenty miles yet to go. It was almost time for the spurt for which he
had been holding back. Yet he would wait until five miles from the end,
and then he felt that he could gain and maintain a lead.

"Andy seems to be doing well," said Mr. Damon.

"Yes, he has a good machine," conceded Tom.

Five miles more were reeled off. Then another five. Another round of
that distance and Tom would key his motor up to the highest pitch, and
then the Humming-Bird would show what she could do. Eagerly Tom waited
for the right signal.

Suddenly the wireless began buzzing again. Quickly the young inventor
clamped the receiver to his ear. Mr. Damon saw him turn pale.

"Dr. Gladby says dad has a turn for the worse. There is little hope,"
translated Tom.

"Will you--are you going to quit?" asked Mr. Damon.

Tom shook his head.

"No!" he cried. "My father has become unconscious, so Mr. Jackson says,
but his last words were to me: 'Tell Tom to win the race!' And I'm
going to do it!"

Tom suddenly changed his plans. There was to be no waiting for the
signal now. He would begin his final spurt, and if possible finish the
hundred miles at his utmost speed, win the race and then hasten to his
father's side.

With a menacing roar the motor of the Humming-Bird took up the
additional power that Tom sent into her. She shot ahead like an eagle
darting after his prey. Tom opened up a big gap between his machine and
the one nearest him, which, at that moment, was the Antoinette, with
the Spaniard driving her.

"Now to win!" cried Tom, grimly.

Surely no race was ever flown as was that one! Tom flashed through the
air so quickly that his speed was almost incredible. The gage
registered one hundred and thirty miles an hour!

Down below in the grand stands, and on the aviation field, there were
yells of approval--of wonder--of fear. But Tom and Mr. Damon could not
hear them. They only heard the powerful song of the motor.

Faster and faster flew the Humming-Bird. Tom looked down, and saw the
signal put up which meant that there were but three miles more to go.
He felt that he could do it. He was half a lap ahead of them all now.
But he saw Andy Foger's machine pulling away from the bunch.

"He's going to try to catch me!" exulted Tom.

Then something happened. The motor of the Humming-Bird suddenly
slackened its speed, it missed explosions, and the trim little craft
began to drop behind.

"What's the matter?" cried Mr. Damon.

"Three of the cylinders are out of business!" yelled Tom. "We're done
for, I guess."

On came the other machines, Andy in the lead, then the Santos-Dumont,
then the Farman, and lastly the Wright. They saw the plight of the
Humming-Bird and determined to beat her. Tom cast a despairing look up
at the motor. There was nothing to be done. He could not reach it in
mid-air. He could only keep on, crippled as he was, and trust to luck.

Andy passed by his rival with an evil smile on his ugly face. Then the
Antoinette flashed by. In turn all the others left Tom in the rear. His
heart was like lead. Mr. Damon gazed blankly forward. They were beaten.
It did not seem possible.

There was but a single chance. If Tom shut off all power, coasted for a
moment, and then, ere the propeller had ceased revolving, if he could
start the motor on the spark, the silent cylinders might pick up, with
the others, and begin again. He would try it. They could be no worse
off than they were.

"A mile behind!" gasped Tom. "It's a long chance, but I'll take it."

He shut off the power. The motor was silent, the Humming-Bird began to
fall. But ere she had gone down ten feet Tom suddenly switched on the
batteries. There was a moment of silence, and then came the welcome
roar that told of the rekindled motor. And such a roar as it was! Every
cylinder was exploding as though none of them had ever stopped!

"We did it!" yelled Tom. Opening up at full speed, he sent the sky
racer on the course to overtake and pass his rivals.

Slowly he crept on them. They looked back and saw him coming. They
tried to put on more speed, but it was impossible. Andy Foger was in
the lead.  He was being slowly overhauled by the Santos-Dumont, with
the queer tail-rudders.

"I'll get him!" muttered Tom. "I'll pass 'em all!"

And he did. With a wonderful burst of speed the little Humming-Bird
overtook one after another of her larger rivals, and passed them. Then
she crept up on Andy's Slugger.

In an instant more it was done, and, a good length in advance of the
Foger craft, Tom shot over the finish line a winner, richer by ten
thousand dollars, and, not only that, but he had picked up a mile that
had been lost, and had snatched victory from almost certain defeat.

There was a succession of thundering cheers as he shut off the motor,
and volplaned to earth, but he paid little attention to them. He
brought his craft to a stop just as the wireless on it buzzed again.

He listened with a look of pain on his face.

"My father is dying," he said simply. "I must go to him. Mr. Damon,
will you fill the tanks with oil and gasoline, while I send off a
message?"

"Oil and gasoline," murmured the odd man, while hundreds pressed up to
congratulate Tom Swift "What are you going to do?"

"I'm going to my father in the Humming-Bird," said Tom. "It's the only
way I can see him alive," and he began to click off a message to Mr.
Jackson, stating that he had won the race and was going to fly to
Shopton, while Mr. Damon and several others replenished the fuel and
oil of the aeroplane.

Tom Swift had won one race. Could he win the other?




Chapter Twenty-Five

Home Again--Conclusion


Mr. Sharp pushed his way through the crowd.

"The committee has the certified check ready for you, Tom," called the
balloonist. "Will you come and get it?"

"Send it to me, please," answered the young inventor. "I must go to my
father."

"Huh! I'd have beaten him in another round," boasted Andy Foger. No one
paid any attention to him.

"Monsieur ezz plucky!" said the Frenchman, Perique. "I am honaired to
shake his hand! He has broken all ze records!"

"Dot's der best machine I effer saw," spoke the Dutchman, De Tromp,
ponderously. "Shake hands!"

"Ver' fine, ver' good!" came from the little Japanese, and all the
contestants congratulated Tom warmly. Never before had a hundred miles
been covered so speedily.

A man elbowed his way through the press of people.

"Is your machine fully protected by patents?" he inquired earnestly.

"It is," said Tom.

"Then, as a representative of the United States Government, I would
like an option to purchase the exclusive right to use them," said the
man.  "Can you guarantee that no one else has any plans of them? It
will mean a fortune to you."

Tom hesitated. He thought of the stolen plans. If he could only get
possession of them! He glanced at Andy Foger, who was wheeling his
machine back into the tent. But there was no time now to have it out
with the bully.

"I will see you again," said Tom to the government agent. "I must go to
my father, who is dying. I can't answer you now."

The tanks were filled. Tom gave a hasty look to his machine, and,
bidding his new friends farewell, he and Mr. Damon took their places
aboard the Humming-Bird. The little craft rose in the air, and soon
they had left Eagle Park far behind. Eagerly Tom strained his eyes for
a sight of his home town, though he knew it would be several hours ere
he could hover over it.

Would he be in time? Would he be in time? That question came to him
again and again.

For a time the Humming-Bird skimmed along as though she delighted in
the rapid motion, in slipping through the air and sliding along on the
billows of wind. Tom, with critical ears, listened to the hum of the
motor, the puffing of the exhaust, the grinding of the gear wheels, and
the clicking of the trips, as valve after valve opened or closed to
admit the mixture of air and gasoline, or closed to give the
compression necessary for the proper explosion.

"Is she working all right?" asked Mr. Damon, anxiously, and, such was
the strain on him that he did not think to bless anything. "Is she all
right, Tom, my lad?"

"I think so. I'm speeding her to the limit. Faster than I ever did
before, but I guess she'll do. She was built to stand a strain, and
she's got to do it now!"

Then there was silence again, as they slid along through the air like a
coaster gliding down a steep descent.

"It was a great race, wasn't it?" asked Mr. Damon, as he shifted to an
easier position in his seat. "A great race, Tom. I didn't think you'd
do it, one spell there."

"Neither did I," came the answer, as the young inventor changed the
spark lever. "But I made up my mind I wouldn't be beaten by Andy Foger,
if I could help it. Though it was taking a risk to shut off the current
the way I did."

"A risk?"

"Yes; it might not have started again," and Tom looked down at the
earth below them, as if measuring the distance he would have fallen had
not his sky racer kept on at the critical moment.

"And--and if the current hadn't come on again; eh, Tom? Would we--?"

Mr. Damon did not finish, but Tom knew what he meant.

"It would have been all up with us," he said simply. "I might have
volplaned back to earth, but at the speed we were going, and at the
height, around a curve, we might have turned turtle."

"Bless my--!" began Mr. Damon, and then he stopped. The thought of
Tom's trouble came to him, and he realized that his words might grate
on the feelings of his companion.

On they rushed through the air with the Humming-Bird speeded up faster
and faster as she warmed to her task. The machinery seemed to be
working perfectly, and as Tom listened to the hum a look of pleasure
replaced the look of anxiety on his face.

"Don't you think we'll make it?" asked Mr. Damon, after another pause,
during which they passed over a large city, the inhabitants exhibiting
much excitement as they sighted the airship over their heads.

"We've got to make it!" declared Tom between his clenched teeth.

He turned on a little more gasoline, and there was a spurt in their
speed which made Mr. Damon grasp the upright braces near him with firm
hands, and his face became a little paler.

"It's all right," spoke Tom, reassuringly. "There's no danger."

But Tom almost reckoned without his host, for a few moments later, as
he was trying to get more revolutions out of the propellers, he ran
into an adverse current of air.

In an instant the Humming-Bird was tilted up almost on her "beams'
ends," so to speak, and had it not been that the young inventor quickly
warped the wing tips, to counteract the pressure on one side, there
might have been a different end to this story.

"Bless my----!" began Mr. Damon, but he got no further, for he had to
bend his body as Tom did, to equalize the pressure of the wind current.

"A little farther over!" yelled the lad. "A little farther over this
way, Mr. Damon!"

"But if I come any more toward you I'll be out of my seat!" objected
the eccentric man.

"If you don't you'll be out of the aeroplane!" cried Tom grimly, and
his companion leaned over as far as he could until the young pilot had
brought the craft to an even keel again.

Then Tom speeded up the motor, which he had partly shut down as they
passed through the danger zone, and again they were racing through
space.

They were nearing Shopton now, as the lad and Mr. Damon could tell by
the familiar landmarks which loomed up in sight. Tom strained his eyes
for the first view of his home.

Suddenly, as they were skimming along, there came a cessation of the
hum and roar that told of the perfectly-working motor. It was an
ominous silence.

"What's--what's wrong?" gasped Mr. Damon.

"Something's given way," answered Tom quickly. "I'm afraid the magneto
isn't sparking as it ought to."

"Well, can't we volplane back to earth?" asked the odd man, for he had
become familiar with this feat when anything happened to the motor.

"We could," answered Tom, "but I'm not going to."

"Why not?"

"Because we're too far from Shopton--and dad! I'm going to keep on.
I've got to--if I want to be there in time!"

"But if the motor doesn't work?"

"I'll make her work!"

Tom was desperately manipulating the various levers and handles
connected with the electrical ignition system. He tried in vain to get
the magneto to resume the giving out of sparks, and, failing in that,
he switched on the batteries. But, to his horror, the dry cells had
given out. There was no way of getting a spark unless the little
electrical machine would work.

The propellers were still whirring around by their own momentum, and if
Tom could switch in the magneto in time all might yet be well.

They had started to fall, but, by quickly bringing up the head plane
tips, Tom sent his craft soaring upward again on a bank of air.

"Here!" he cried to Mr. Damon. "Take the steering-wheel and kept her on
this level as long as you can."

"What are you going to do?"

"I've got to fix that magneto!"

"But if she dips down?"

"Throw up the head planes as I did. It's our only chance! I can't go
down now, so far from Shopton!"

Mr. Damon reached over and took the wheel from Tom's hands. Then the
young inventor, leaning forward, for the magneto was within easy reach,
looked to see what the trouble was. He found it quickly. A wire had
vibrated loose from a binding-post. In a second Tom had it in place
again; and, ere the propellers had ceased revolving, he had turned the
switch. The magneto took up the work in a flash. Once more the spark
exploded the gasoline mixture, and the propellers sent the Humming-Bird
swiftly ahead.

"We'll make it now!" declared Tom grimly.

"We're almost there," added Mr. Damon, as he relinquished the wheel to
the young pilot. The craft had gone down some, but Tom sent her up
again.

Nearer and nearer home they came, until at last the spires of the
Shopton churches loomed into view. Then he was over the village. Now he
was within sight of his own house.

Tom coasted down a bank of air, and brought the Humming-Bird up with a
jerk of the ground brakes. Before the wheels had ceased turning he had
leaped out.

"It's Massa Tom!" cried Eradicate, as he saw Tom alight.

The young inventor hurried into the house. He was met by the nurse, who
held up a warning finger. Tom's heart almost stopped beating. He was
aware that Dr. Gladby came from the room where Mr. Swift lay.

"Is he--is he--am I too late?" gulped Tom.

"Hush!" cautioned the nurse.

Tom reeled, and would have fallen had not the doctor caught him, for
the lad was weak and worn out.

"He is going to get well!" were the joyful words he heard, as if in a
dream, and then his strength suddenly came back to him. "The crisis is
just passed, Tom," went on Dr. Gladby, "and your father will recover,
and be stronger than ever. Your good news of winning was like a tonic
to him. Now let me congratulate you on the race." Tom had flashed by
wireless a brief message of his success.

"Dad's news is better than all the congratulations in the world," he
said softly, as he grasped the doctor's hand.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was a week later. Mr. Swift improved rapidly once the course of the
disease was permanently checked, and he was soon able to sit up. Tom
was with him in the room, talking of the great race, and how he had
won. He fingered the certified check for ten thousand dollars that had
just come to him by mail.

"You certainly did wonderfully well," said the aged inventor, softly.
"Wonderfully well, Tom. I'm proud of you."

"You may well be," added Mr. Damon. "Bless my shoelaces, but I thought
Andy Foger had us there one spell; didn't you, Tom?"

"Indeed I did. But you helped me win, Mr. Damon."

"Nonsense!" exclaimed the odd man.

"Yes, you did. You helped me a lot."

"Well, are you going to keep after more air-prizes, Tom, or are you
going to try for something else?" asked his father.

"I don't believe I'll go in any more aeroplane races right away,"
answered the young inventor. "For some time I've been wanting to
complete and perfect my electric rifle. I think I'll begin work on that
soon."

"And go hunting?" asked Mr. Damon.

"I think so," answered Tom, dreamily. "I don't know just where, though."

Where he went, and what he shot, will be told in the next volume of
this series, to be called: "Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle; or,
Daring Adventures in Elephant Land."

For a few moments after Tom's announcement no one spoke, then the young
inventor said:

"It's too bad that first set of plans were stolen. If I had them I
could make a good deal with the Government about my little aeroplane.
But they don't want to take up with it as long as there is a chance of
some foreign nation getting information about the secret parts, and my
patents won't hold abroad. I wonder if there is any way of getting
those plans away from Andy Foger? I don't understand why he hasn't used
them before this. I thought sure he would make a craft like the
Humming-Bird to race against me."

"What plans are those?" asked Mr. Swift.

"Why, don't you remember?" asked Tom. "The ones I showed you one day,
in the library, when you fell asleep, and some one slipped in and stole
them."

A curious look came over Mr. Swift's face. He passed his hand across
his brow.

"I am beginning to remember something I have been trying to recall ever
since I became ill," he said slowly. "It is coming back to me. Those
plans--in the library--I fell asleep, but before I did so I hid those
plans, Tom!"

"You hid those plans!" Tom fairly shouted the words.

"Yes, I remember feeling a drowsy feeling coming on, and I feared lest
some one might see the drawings. I got up and put them under the
window, in a little, hollow place in the foundation wall. Then I came
back in through the window again, and went to sleep. Then, on account
of my illness, just as I once before forgot something, and thought the
minister had called, I lost all recollection of them. I hid those
plans."

Tom leaped to his feet. He rushed to the place named by his father.
Soon his triumphant shout told of his success. He came hurrying back
into the house with a roll of papers in his hands.

And there were the long-missing plans! damp and stained by the weather,
but all there. No enemy had them, and Tom's secret was safe.

"Now I can accept the Government offer!" he cried. And a few weeks
later he made a most advantageous deal with the United States officials
for his patents.

Dr. Gladby explained that Mr. Swift's queer action was due to his
illness. He became liable to lapses of memory, and one happened just
after he hid away the plans. Even the hiding of them was caused by the
peculiar condition of his brain. He had opened the library window,
slipped oot with the papers, and hastened in again, to fall asleep in
his chair, during the short time Tom was gone.

"And Andy Foger never took them at all," remarked Mary Nestor, when Tom
was telling her about it a few days afterward.

"No. I guess I must apologize to him." Which Tom did, but Andy did not
receive it very graciously, especially as Tom accused him of trying to
destroy the Humming-Bird.

Andy denied this and denied having anything to do with the mysterious
fire, and, as there was no way to prove him guilty, Tom could not
proceed against him. So the matter was dropped.

Mr. Swift continued to improve, and was soon himself again, and able to
resume his inventive work. Tom received several offers to give
exhibition flights at big aero meets, but refused, as he was busy on
his new rifle. Mr. Damon helped him.

Andy Foger made several successful flights in his queer aeroplane,
which turned out to be the product of a German genius who was supplied
with money by Mr. Foger. Andy became very proud, and boasted that he
and the German were going abroad to give flights in Europe.

"I'd be glad if he would," said Tom, when he heard of the plan. "He
wouldn't bother me then."

With the money received from winning the big race, and from his
contracts from the Government, Tom Swift was now in a fair way to
become quite wealthy. He was destined to have many more adventures;
yet, come what might, never would he forget the thrilling happenings
that fell to his lot while flying for the ten-thousand dollar prize in
his sky racer.

CHAPTER I

TOM WANTS EXCITEMENT


"Have you anything special to do to-night, Ned?" asked Tom Swift,
the well-known inventor, as he paused in front of his chum's window,
in the Shopton National Bank.

"No, nothing in particular," replied the bank clerk, as he stacked
up some bundles of bills. "Why do you ask?"

"I wanted you to come over to the house for a while."

"Going to have a surprise party, or something like that?"

"No, only I've got something I'd like to show you."

"A new invention?"

"Well, not exactly new. You've seen it before, but not since I've
improved it. I'm speaking of my new electric rifle. I've got it
ready to try, now, and I'd like to see what you think of it. There's
a rifle range over at the house, and we can practice some shooting,
if you haven't anything else to do."

"I haven't, and I'll be glad to come. What are you doing in the
bank, anyhow; putting away more of your wealth, Tom?"

"Yes, I just made a little deposit. It's some money I got from the
government for the patents on my sky racer, and I'm salting it down
here until Dad and I can think of a better investment."

"Good idea. Bring us all the money you can," and the bank clerk, who
held a small amount of stock in the financial institution, laughed,
his chum joining in with him.

"Well, then. I'll expect you over this evening," went on the
youthful inventor, as he turned to leave the bank.

"Yes, I'll be there. Say, Tom, have you heard the latest about Andy
Foger?"

"No, I haven't heard much since he left town right after I beat him
in the aeroplane race at Eagle Park."

"Well, he's out of town all right, and I guess for a long time this
trip. He's gone to Europe."

"To Europe, eh? Well, he threatened to go there after he failed to
beat me in the race, but I thought he was only bluffing."

"No, he's really gone this time."

"Well, I, for one, am glad of it. Did he take his aeroplane along?"

"Yes, that's what he went for. It seems that this Mr. Landbacher,
the German who really invented it, and built it with money which Mr.
Foger supplied, has an idea he can interest the German or some other
European government in the machine. Andy wanted to go along with
him, and as Mr. Foger financed the scheme, I guess he thought it
would be a good thing to have some one represent him. So Andy's
gone."

"Then he won't bother me. Well, I must get along. I'll expect you
over to-night," and with a wave of his hand Tom Swift hurried from
the bank.

The young inventor jumped into his electric runabout which stood
outside the institution, and was about to start off when he saw a
newsboy selling papers which had just come in from New York, on the
morning train.

"Here, Jack, give me a TIMES," called Tom to the lad, and he tossed
the newsboy a nickel. Then, after glancing at the front page, and
noting the headings, Tom started off his speedy car, in which, on
one occasion, he had made a great run, against time. He was soon at
home.

"Well, Dad, I've got the money safely put away," he remarked to an
aged gentleman who sat in the library reading a book. "Now we won't
have to worry about thieves until we get some more cash in."

"Well, I'm glad it's coming in so plentifully," said Mr. Swift with
a smile. "Since my illness I haven't been able to do much, Tom, and
it all depends on you, now."

"Don't let that worry you, Dad. You'll soon be as busy as ever,"
for, following a serious operation for an ailment of the heart, Mr.
Swift, who was a veteran inventor, had not been able to do much. But
the devices of his son, especially a speedy monoplane, which Tom
invented, and sold to the United States Government, were now
bringing them in a large income. In fact with royalties from his
inventions and some gold and diamonds which he had secured on two
perilous trips, Tom Swift was quite wealthy.

"I'll never be as busy as I once was," went on Mr. Swift, a little
regretfully, "but I don't know that I care as long as you continue
to turn out new machines, Tom. By the way, how is the electric rifle
coming on? I haven't heard you speak of it lately."

"It's practically finished, Dad. It worked pretty well the time I
took it when we went on the trip to the caves of ice, but I've
improved it very much since then. In fact I'm going to give it a
severe test to-night. Ned Newton is coming over, and it may be that
then we'll find out something about it that could be bettered. But I
think not. It suits me as it is."

"So Ned is coming over to see it; eh? You ought to have Mr. Damon
here to bless it a few times."

"Yes, I wish I did. And he may come along at any moment, as it is.
You never can tell when he is going to turn up. Mrs. Baggert says
you were out walking while I was at the bank, Dad. Do you feel
better after it?"

"Yes, I think I do, Tom. Oh, I'm growing stronger every day, but it
will take time. But now tell me something about the electric gun."

Thereupon the young inventor related to his father some facts about
the improvements he had recently made to the weapon. It was dinner
time when he had finished, and, after the meal Tom went out to the
shed where he built his aeroplanes and his airships, and in which
building he had fitted up a shooting gallery.

"I'll get ready for the trial to-night," he said "I want to see what
it will do to a dummy figure. Guess I'll make a sort of scarecrow
and stuff it with straw. I'll get Eradicate to help me. Rad! I say,
Rad! Where are you?"

"Heah I is, Massa Tom! Heah I is," called a colored man as he came
around the corner of a small stable where he kept his mule
Boomerang. "Was yo'-all callin' me?"

"Yes, Rad, I want you to help make a scarecrow."

"A scarecrow, Massa Tom! Good land a' massy! What fo' yo' want ob a
scarecrow? Yo'-all ain't raisin' no corn, am yo'?"

"No, but I want something to shoot at when Ned Newton comes over
to-night."

"Suffin t' shoot at? Why Massa Tom! Good land a' massy! Yo'-all
ain't gwine t' hab no duel, am yo'?"

"No, Rad, but I want a life-size figure on which to try my new
electric gun. Here are some old clothes, and if you will stuff them
with rags and straw and fix them so they'll stand up, they'll do
first-rate. Have it ready by night, and set it up at the far end of
the shooting gallery."

"All right, Massa Tom. I'll jest do dat, fo' yo'," and leaving the
colored man to stuff the figure, after he had showed him how, Tom
went back into the house to read the paper which he had purchased
that morning.

He skimmed over the news, thinking perhaps he might see something of
the going abroad of Andy Foger with the German aeroplane, but there
was nothing.

"I almost wish I was going to Europe," sighed Tom. "I will certainly
have to get busy at something, soon. I haven't had any adventure
since I won the prize at the Eagle Park aviation meet in my sky
racer. Jove! That was some excitement! I'd like to do that over
again, only I shouldn't want to have Dad so sick," for just before
the race, Tom had saved his father's life by making a quick run in
the aeroplane, to bring a celebrated surgeon to the invalid's aid.

"I certainly wish I could have some new adventures," mused Tom, as
he turned the pages of the paper. "I could afford to take a trip
around the earth after them, too, with the way money is coming in
now. Yes, I do wish I could have some excitement. Hello, what's
this! A big elephant hunt in Africa. Hundreds of the huge creatures
captured in a trap--driven in by tame beasts. Some are shot for
their tusks. Others will be sent to museums."

He was reading the headlines of the article that had attracted his
attention, and, as he read, he became more and more absorbed in it.
He read the story through twice, and then, with sparkling eyes, he
exclaimed:

"That's just what I want. Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my
new electric rifle, and an airship, what couldn't a fellow do over
in the dark continent! I've a good notion to go there! I wonder if
Ned would go with me? Mr. Damon certainly would. Elephant shooting
in Africa! In an airship! I could finish my new sky craft in short
order if I wanted to. I've a good notion to do it!"




CHAPTER II

TRYING THE NEW GUN


While Tom Swift is thus absorbed in thinking about a chance to hunt
elephants, we will take the opportunity to tell you a little more
about him, and then go on with the story.

Many of you already know the young inventor, but those who do not
may be interested in hearing that he is a young American lad, full
of grit and ginger, who lives with his aged father in the town of
Shopton, in New York State. Our hero was first introduced to the
public in the book, "Tom Swift and His Motorcycle."

In that volume it was related how Tom bought a motor-cycle from a
Mr. Wakefield Damon, of Waterford. Mr. Damon was an eccentric
individual, who was continually blessing himself, some one else, or
something belonging to him. His motor-cycle tried to climb a tree
with him, and that was why he sold it to Tom. The two thus became
acquainted, and their friendship grew from year to year.

After many adventures on his motor-cycle Tom got a motor-boat, and
had some exciting times in that. One of the things he and his father
and his chum, Ned Newton, did, was to rescue, from a burning balloon
that had fallen into Lake Carlopa, an aeronaut named John Sharp.
Later Tom and Mr. Sharp built an airship called the Red Cloud, and
with Mr. Damon and some others had a series of remarkable fights.

In the Red Cloud they got on the track of some bank robbers, and
captured them, thus foiling the plans of Andy Foger, a town bully,
and one of Tom's enemies, and putting to confusion the plot of Mr.
Foger, Andy's father.

After many adventures in the air Tom and his friends, in a submarine
boat, invented by Mr. Swift, went under the ocean for sunken
treasure and secured a large part of it.

It was not long after this that Tom conceived the idea of a powerful
electric car, which proved, to be the speediest of the road, and in
it he won a great race, and saved from ruin a bank in which his
father and Mr. Damon were interested.

The sixth book of the series, entitled "Tom Swift and His Wireless
Message," tells how, in testing a new electric airship, which a
friend of Mr. Damon's had invented, Tom, the inventor and Mr. Damon
were lost on an island in the middle of the ocean. There they found
some castaways, among whom were Mr. and Mrs. Nestor, parents of Mary
Nestor of Shopton, a girl of whom Tom was quite fond.

Tom Swift, after his arrival home, went on an expedition among a
gang of men known as the "Diamond Makers" who were hidden in the
Rocky Mountains. He was accompanied by Mr. Barcoe Jenks, one of the
castaways of Earthquake Island. They found the diamond makers, and
had some surprising adventures, barely escaping with their lives.

This did not daunt Tom, however, and he once more started off on an
expedition in his airship the Red Cloud to Alaska, amid the caves of
ice. He was searching for a valley of gold, and though he and his
friends found it, they came to grief. The Fogers, father and son,
tried to steal the gold from them, and, failing in that, incited the
Eskimos against our friends. There was a battle, but the forces of
nature were even more to be dreaded than the terrible savages.

The ice cave, in which the Red Cloud was stored, collapsed, crushing
the gallant craft, and burying it out of sight forever under
thousand of tons of the frozen bergs.

After a desperate journey Tom and his friends reached civilization,
with a large supply of gold. Tom regretted very much the destruction
of the airship, but he at once set to work on another--a monoplane
this time, instead of a combined aeroplane and dirigible balloon.
This new craft he called the Humming-Bird and it was a "sky racer"
of terrific speed. In it, as we have said, Tom brought a specialist
to operate on his father, when, because of a broken railroad bridge,
the physician could not otherwise have gotten to Shopton. He and Tom
traveled through the air at the rate of over one hundred miles an
hour. Later, Tom took part in a big race for a ten-thousand-dollar
prize, and won, defeating Andy Foger, and a number of well-known
"bird-men" who used biplanes and monoplanes of a more or less
familiar type.

The government became interested in Tom's craft, the Humming-Bird,
and, as told in the ninth book of this series, Tom Swift and His Sky
Racer, they secured some rights in the invention.

And now Tom, who had done nothing for several months following the
great race--that is, nothing save to work on his new rifle--Tom, we
say, sighed for new adventures.

"Well, Tom, what is on your mind?" asked his father at the supper
table that evening. "What is worrying you?"

"Nothing is worrying me, Dad."

"You are thinking of something. I can see that. Are you afraid your
electric rifle won't work as well as you hope, when Ned comes over
to try it?"

"No, it isn't that, Dad. But I may as well tell you, I guess. I've
been reading in the paper about a big elephant hunt in Africa, and
I--"

"That's enough, Tom! You needn't say any more," interrupted Mr.
Swift. "I can see which way the wind is blowing. You want to go to
Africa with your new rifle."

"Well, Dad, not exactly--that is--"

"Now, Tom, you needn't deny it," and Mr. Swift laughed. "Well, I
don't blame you a bit. You have been rather idle of late."

"I would like to go, Dad," admitted the young inventor, "only I'd
never think of it while you weren't well."

"Don't worry about me, Tom. Of course I will be lonesome while you
are gone, but don't let that stand in the way. If you want to go to
Africa, you may start to-morrow, and take your new rifle with you."

"The rifle part would be all right, Dad, but if I went I'd want to
take an airship along, and it will take me some little time to
finish the Black Hawk, as I have named my new craft."

"Well, there's no special hurry, is there?" asked Mr. Swift. "The
elephants in Africa are likely to stay there for some time. If you
want to go, why don't you get right to work on the Black Hawk and
make the trip? I'd like to go myself."

"I wish you would, Dad," exclaimed Tom eagerly.

"No, son, I couldn't think of it. I want to stay here and get well.
Then I am going to resume work on my wireless motor. Perhaps I'll
have it finished when you come back from Africa with an airship load
of elephants' tusks."

"Perhaps," admitted the young inventor. "Well, Dad, I'll think of
it. But now I'm going after my rifle, and--"

Tom was interrupted by a ring of the front-door bell, and Mrs.
Baggert, the housekeeper, who was almost like a mother to the youth,
went to answer it.

"It's Ned Newton, I guess," murmured Tom, and, a little later, his
chum entered the room.

"Oh, I guess I'm early," said Ned. "Haven't you had supper yet,
Tom?"

"Yes, we're just finished. Come on out and we'll try the gun."

"And practice shooting elephants," added Mr. Swift with a laugh, as
he mentioned to Ned the latest idea of Tom.

"Say! That would be great!" cried the bank clerk. "I wish I could
go!"

"Come along!" invited Tom cordially. "We'll have more fun than we
did in the caves of ice," for Ned had gone on the voyage to Alaska.

The two youths went out to the shed where the rifle gallery had been
built. The new electric weapon was out there, and Eradicate Sampson,
the colored man, who was a sort of servant and man-of-all-work about
the Swift household, had set up the scarecrow figure at the end of
the gallery.

"Now we'll try some shots," said Tom, as he took the gun out of the
case. "Just turn on a few more lights, will you, Mr. Jackson," and
the engineer, who was employed by Tom and his father to aid them in
their inventive work, did as requested.

The gallery was now brilliantly illuminated, with the reflectors
throwing the beams on the big stuffed figure, which, save for a
face, looked very much like a human being, standing at the end of
the gallery.

"I don't suppose you want to go down there and hold it, while I
shoot at it; do you, Rad?" asked Tom jokingly, as he prepared the
electric rifle for use.

"No indeedy, I don't!" cried Eradicate. "Yo'-all will hab t' scuse
me, Massa Tom. I think I'll be goin' now."

"What's your hurry?" asked Ned, as he saw the colored man hastily
preparing to leave the improvised gallery.

"I spects I'd better fro' down some mo' straw fo' a bed fo' my mule
Boomerang!" exclaimed Eradicate, as he hastily slid out of the door,
and shut it after him.

"Rad is nervous," remarked Tom. "He doesn't like this gun. Well, it
certainly does great execution."

"How does it work'" asked Ned, as he looked at the curious gun. The
electric weapon was not unlike an ordinary heavy rifle in appearance
save that the barrel was a little longer, and the stock larger in
every way. There were also a number of wheels, levers, gears and
gages on the stock.

"It works by electricity," explained Tom.

"That is, the force comes from a powerful current of stored
electricity."

"Oh, then you have storage batteries in the stock?"

"Not exactly. There are no batteries, but the current is a sort of
wireless kind. It is stored in a cylinder, just as compressed air or
gases are stored, and can be released as I need it."

"And when it's all gone, what do you do?"

"Make more power by means of a small dynamo."

"And does it shoot lead bullets?"

"Not at all. There are no bullets used."

"Then how does it kill?"

"By means of a concentrated charge of electricity which is shot from
the barrel with great force. You can't see it, yet it is there. It's
just as if you concentrated a charge of electricity of five thousand
volts into a small globule the size of a bullet. That flies through
space, strikes the object aimed at and--well, we'll see what it does
in a minute. Mr. Jackson, just put that steel plate up in front of
the scarecrow; will you?"

The engineer proceeded to put into place a section of steel armor-plate
before the stuffed figure.

"You don't mean to say you're going to shoot through that, do you?"
asked Ned in surprise.

"Surely. The electric bullets will pierce anything. They'll go
through a brick wall as easily as the x-rays do. That's one valuable
feature of my rifle. You don't have to see the object you aim at. In
fact you can fire through a house, and kill something on the other
side."

"I should think that would be dangerous."

"It would be, only I can calculate exactly, by means of an automatic
arrangement, just how far the charge of electricity will go. It
stops short just at the limit of the range, and is not effective
beyond that. Otherwise, if I did not limit it and if I fired at the
scarecrow, through the piece of steel, and the bullet hit the
figure, it would go on, passing through whatever else was in the
way, until its power was lost. I use the term 'bullet,' though as I
said, it isn't properly one."

"By Jove, Tom, it certainly is a dangerous weapon!"

"Yes, the range-limit idea is a new one. That's what I've been
working on lately. There are other features of the gun which I'll
explain later, particularly the power it has to shoot out luminous
bars of light. But now we'll see what it will do to the image."

Tom took his place at the end of the range, and began to adjust some
valves and levers. In spite of the fact that the gun was larger than
an ordinary rifle, it was not as heavy as the United States Army
weapon.

Tom aimed at the armor-plate, and, by means of an arrangement on the
rifle, he could tell exactly when he was pointing at the scarecrow,
even though he could not see it.

"Here she goes!" he suddenly exclaimed.

Ned watched his chum. The young inventor pressed a small button at
the side of the rifle barrel, about where the trigger should have
been. There was no sound, no smoke, no flame and not the slightest
jar.

Yet as Ned watched he saw the steel plate move slightly. The next
instant the scarecrow figure seemed to fly all to pieces. There was
a shower of straw, rags and old clothes, which fell in a shapeless
heap at the end of the range.

"Say. I guess you did for that fellow, all right!" exclaimed Ned.

"It looks so," admitted Tom, with a note of pride in his voice. "Now
we'll try another test."

As he laid aside his rifle in order to help Mr. Jackson shift the
steel plate there was a series of yells outside the shed.

"What's that?" asked Tom, in some alarm.

"Sounds like some one calling," answered Ned.

"It is," agreed Mr. Jackson. "Perhaps Eradicate's mule has gotten
loose. I guess we'd better--"

He did not finish, for the shouts increased in volume, and Tom and
Ned could hear some one yelling:

"I'll have the law on you for this! I'll have you arrested, Tom
Swift! What do you mean by trying to kill me? Where are you? Don't
try to hide away, now. You were trying to shoot me, and I'm not
going to have it!"

Some one pounded on the door of the shed.

"It's Barney Moker!" exclaimed Tom. "I wonder what can have
happened?"




CHAPTER III

A DIFFICULT TEST


Tom Swift opened the door of the improvised rifle gallery and looked
out. By the light of a full moon, which shone down from a cloudless
sky, he saw a man standing at the portal. The man's face was
distorted with rage, and he shook his fist at the young inventor.

"What do you mean by shooting at me?" he demanded. "What do you
mean, I say? The idea of scaring honest folks out of their wits, and
making 'em think the end of the world has come! What do you mean by
it? Why don't you answer me? I say, Tom Swift, why don't you answer
me?"

"Because you don't give me a chance, Mr. Moker," replied our hero.

"I want to know why you shot at me? I demand to know!" and Mr.
Moker, who was a sort of miserly town character, living all alone in
a small house, just beyond Tom's home, again shook his fist almost
in the lad's face. "Why don't you tell me? Why don't you tell me?"
he shouted.

"I will, if you give me a chance!" fairly exploded Tom. "If you can
be cool for five minutes, and come inside and tell me what happened
I'll be glad to answer any of your questions, Mr. Moker. I didn't
shoot at you."

"Yes, you did! You tried to shoot a hole through me!"

"Tell me about it?" suggested Tom, as the excited man calmed down
somewhat. "Are you hurt?"

"No, but it isn't your fault that I'm not. You tried hard enough to
hurt me. Here I am, sitting at my table reading, and, all at once
something goes through the side of the house, whizzes past my ear,
makes my hair fairly stand up on end, and goes outside the other
side of the house. What kind of bullets do you use, Tom Swift?
that's what I want to know. They went through the side of my house,
and never left a mark. I demand to know what kind they are."

"I'll tell you, if you'll only give me a chance," went on Tom
wearily. "How do you know it was me shooting?"

"How do I know? Why, doesn't the end of this shooting gallery of
yours point right at my house? Of course it does; you can't deny
it!"

Tom did not attempt to, and Mr. Moker went on:

"Now what do you mean by it?"

"If any of the bullets from my electric gun went near you, it was a
mistake, and I'm sorry for it," said Tom.

"Well, they did, all right," declared the excited man. "They went
right past my ear."

"I don't see how they could," declared Tom. "I was trying my new
electric rifle, but I had the limit set for two hundred feet, the
length of the gallery. That is, the electrical discharge couldn't go
beyond that distance."

"I don't know what it was, but it went through the side of my house
all the same," insisted Mr. Moker. "It didn't make a hole, but it
scorched the wall paper a little."

"I don't see how it could," declared Tom. "It couldn't possibly have
gone over two hundred feet with the gage set for that distance." He
paused suddenly, and hurried over to where he had placed his gun.
Catching up the weapon he looked at the gage dial. Then he uttered
an exclamation.

"I'm sorry to admit that you are right, Mr. Moker!" he said finally.
"I made a mistake. The gage is set for a thousand feet instead of
two hundred. I forgot to change it. The charge, after passing
through the steel plate, and the scarecrow figure, destroying the
latter, went on, and shot through the side of your house."

"Ha! I knew you were trying to shoot me!" exclaimed the still angry
man. "I'll have the law on you for this!"

"Oh, that's all nonsense!" broke in Ned Newton. "Everybody knows Tom
Swift wouldn't try to shoot you, or any one else, Mr. Moker."

"Then why did he shoot at me?"

"That was a mistake," explained Tom, "and I apologize to you for
it."

"Humph! A lot of good that would do me, if I'd been killed!"
muttered the miser. "I'm going to sue you for this. You might have
put me in my grave."

"Impossible!" exclaimed Tom.

"Why impossible?" demanded the visitor.

"Because I had so set the rifle that almost the entire force of the
electrical bullet was expended in blowing apart the scarecrow figure
I made for a test," explained Tom. "All that passed through your
house was a small charge, and, if it HAD hit you there would have
been no more than a little shock, such as you would feel in taking
hold of an electric battery."

"How do I know this?" asked the man cunningly. "You say so, but for
all I know you may have wanted to kill me."

"Why?" asked Tom, trying not to laugh.

"Oh, so you might get some of my money. Of course I ain't got none,"
the miser went on quickly, "but folks thinks I've got a lot, and I
have to be on the lookout all the while, or they'd murder me for
it."

"I wouldn't," declared the young inventor. "It was a mistake. Only
part of the spent charge passed near you. Why, if it had been a
powerful charge you would never have been able to come over here. I
set the main charge to go off inside the scarecrow, and it did so,
as you can see by looking at what's left of it," and he pointed to
the pile of clothes and rags.

"How do I know this?" insisted the miser with a leer at the two
lads.

"Because if the charge had gone off either before or after it passed
through the figure, it would not have caused such havoc of the cloth
and straw," explained Tom. "First the charge would have destroyed
the steel plate, which it passed through without even denting it.
Why, look here, I will now fire the rifle at short range, and set it
to destroy the plate. See what happens."

He quickly adjusted the weapon, and aimed it at the plate, which,
had again been set up on the range. This time Tom was careful to set
the gage so that even a small part of the spent charge would not go
outside the gallery.

The young inventor pressed the button, and instantly the heavy steel
plate was bent, torn and twisted as though a small sized cannon ball
had gone through it.

"That's what the rifle will do at short range," said Tom. "Don't
worry, Mr. Moker, you didn't have a narrow escape. You were in no
danger at all, though I apologize for the fright I caused you."

"Humph! That's an easy way to get out of it!" exclaimed the miser.
"I believe I could sue you for damages, anyhow. Look at my scorched
wall paper."

"Oh, I'll pay for that," said Tom quickly, for he did not wish to
have trouble with the unpleasant man. "Will ten dollars be enough?"
He knew that the whole room could be repapered for that, and he did
not believe the wall-covering was sufficiently damaged for such work
to be necessary.

"Well, if you'll make it twelve dollars, I won't say anything more
about it," agreed the miser craftily, "though it's worth thirteen
dollars, if it is a penny. Give me twelve dollars, Tom Swift, and I
won't prosecute you."

"All right, twelve dollars it shall be," responded the young
inventor, passing over the money, and glad to be rid of the
unpleasant character.

"And after this, just fire that gun of yours the other way,"
suggested Mr. Moker as he went out, carefully folding the bills
which Tom had handed him.

"Hum! that was rather queer," remarked Ned, after a pause.

"It sure was," agreed his chum. "This rifle will do more than I
thought it would. I'll have to be more careful. I was sure I set the
gage for two hundred feet. I'll have to invent some automatic
attachment to prevent it being discharged when the gage is set
wrong." Let us state here that Tom did this, and never had another
accident.

"Well, does this end the test?" asked Ned.

"No, indeed. I want you to try it, while I look on," spoke Tom. "We
haven't any more stuffed figures to fire at, but I'll set up some
targets. Come on, try your luck at a shot."

"I'm afraid I might disturb Mr. Moker, or some of the neighbors."

"No danger. I've got it adjusted right now. Come on, see if you can
shatter this steel target," and Tom set up a small one at the end of
the range.

Then, having properly fixed the weapon, Tom handed it to his chum,
and, taking his place in a protected part of the gallery, prepared
to watch the effect of the shot.

"Let her go!" cried Tom, and Ned pressed the button.

The effect was wonderful. Though there was no noise, smoke nor
flame, the steel plate seemed to crumple up, and collapse as if it
had been melted in the fire. There was a jagged hole through the
center, but some frail boards back of it were not even splintered.

"Good shot!" cried Tom enthusiastically. "I had the distance gage
right that time."

"You sure did," agreed Ned. "The electric bullet stopped as soon as
it did its work on the plate. What's next?"

"I'm going to try a difficult test," explained Tom. "You know I said
the gun would shoot luminous charges?"

"Yes."

"Well, I'm going to try that, now. I wish we had another image to
shoot at, but I'll take a big dry-goods box, and make believe it's
an elephant. Now, this is going to be a hard test, such as we'd meet
with, if we were hunting in Africa. I want you to help me."

"What am I to do?" asked Ned.

"I want you to go outside," explained Tom, "set up a dry-goods box
against the side of the little hill back of the shed, and not tell
me where you put it. Then I'll go out, and, by means of the luminous
charge, I'll locate the box, set the distance gage, and destroy it."

"Well, you can see it anyhow, in the moonlight," objected Ned.

"No, the moon is under a cloud now," explained Tom, looking out of a
window. "It's quite dark, and will give me just the test I want for
my new electric rifle."

"But won't it be dangerous, firing in the dark? Suppose you misjudge
the distance, and the bullet, or charge, files off and hits some
one?"

"It can't. I'll set the distance gage before I shoot. But if I
should happen to make a mistake the charge will go into the side of
the hill, and spend itself there. There is no danger. Go ahead, and
set up the box, and then come and tell me. Mr. Jackson will help
you."

Ned and the engineer left the gallery. As Tom had said, it was very
dark now, and if Tom could see in the night to hit a box some
distance away, his weapon would be all that he claimed for it.

"This will do," said the engineer, as he pointed to a box, one of
several piled up outside the shed. The two could hardly see to make
their way along, carrying it to the foot of the hill, and they
stumbled several times. But at last it was in position, and then Ned
departed to call Tom, and have him try the difficult test--that of
hitting an object in the dark.




CHAPTER IV

BIG TUSKS WANTED


"Well, are you all ready for me?" asked the young inventor, as he
took up his curious weapon, and followed Ned out into the yard. It
was so dark that they had fairly to stumble along.

"Yes, we're ready," answered Ned. "And you'll be a good one, Tom, if
you do this stunt. Now stand here," he went on, as he indicated a
place as well as he could in the dark. "The box is somewhere in that
direction," and he waved his hand vaguely. "I'm not going to tell
you any more, and let's see you find it."

"Oh, I will, all right--or, rather, my electric rifle will,"
asserted Tom.

The inventor of the curious and terrible weapon took his position.
Behind him stood Ned and Mr. Jackson, and just before Tom was ready
to fire, his father came stalking through the darkness, calling to
them.

"Are you there, Tom?"

"Yes Dad, is anything the matter?"

"No, but I thought I'd like to see what luck you have. Rad was
saying you were going to have a test in the dark."

"I'm about ready for it," replied Tom. "I'm going to blow up a box
that I can't see. You know how it's done, Dad, for you helped me in
perfecting the luminous charge, but it's going to be something of a
novelty to the others. Here we go, now!"

Tom raised his rifle, and aimed it in the dark. Ned Newton,
straining his eyes to see, was sure the young inventor was pointing
the gun at least twenty feet to one side of where the box was
located, but he said nothing, for from experiences in the past, he
realized that Tom knew what he was doing.

There was a little clicking sound, as the youth moved some gear
wheel on his gun. Then there came a faint crackling noise, like some
distant wireless apparatus beginning to flash a message through
space.

Suddenly a little ball of purplish light shot through the darkness
and sped forward like some miniature meteor. It shed a curious
illuminating glow all about, and the ground, and the objects on it
were brought into relief as by a lightning flash.

An instant later the light increased in intensity, and seemed to
burst like some piece of aerial fireworks. There was a bright glare,
in which Ned and the others could see the various buildings about
the shed. They could see each other's faces, and they looked pale
and ghastly in the queer glow. They could see the box, brought into
bold relief, where Ned and the engineer had placed it.

Then, before the light had died away, they witnessed a curious
sight. The heavy wooden box seemed to dissolve, to collapse and to
crumple up like one of paper, and ere the last rays of the
illuminating bullet faded, the watchers saw the splinters of wood
fall back with a clatter in a little heap on the spot where the
dry-goods case had been.

A silence followed, and the darkness was all the blacker by contrast
with the intense light. At length Tom spoke, and he could not keep
from his voice a note of triumph.

"Well, did I do it?" he asked.

"You sure did!" exclaimed Ned heartily.

"Fine!" cried Mr. Swift.

"Golly! I wouldn't gib much fo' de hide ob any burglar what comed
around heah!" muttered Eradicate Sampson. "Dat box am knocked clean
into nuffiness, Massa Tom."

"That's what I wanted to do," explained the lad. "And I guess this
will end the test for tonight."

"But I don't exactly understand it," spoke Ned, as they all moved
toward the Swift home, Eradicate going to the stable to see how his
mule was. "Do you have two kinds of bullets, Tom, one for night and
one for the daytime?"

"No," answered Tom, "there is only one kind of bullet, and, as I
have said, that isn't a bullet at all. That is, you can't see it, or
handle it, but you can feel it. Strictly speaking, it is a
concentrated discharge of wireless electricity directed against a
certain object. You can't see it any more than you can see a
lightning bolt, though that is sometimes visible as a ball of fire.
My electric rifle bullets are similar to a discharge of lightning,
except that they are invisible."

"But we saw the one just now," objected Ned.

"No, you didn't see the bullet," said Tom.

"You saw the illuminating flash which I send out just before I fire,
to reveal the object I am to hit. That is another part of my rifle
and is only used at night."

"You see I shoot out a ball of electrical fire which will disclose
the target, or the enemy at whom I am firing. As soon as that is
discharged the rifle automatically gets ready to shoot the electric
charge, and I have only to press the proper button, and the
'bullet,' as I call it, follows on the heels of the ball of light.
Do you see?"

"Perfectly," exclaimed Ned with a laugh. "What a gun that would be
for hunting, since most all wild beasts come out only at night."

"That was one object in making this invention," said Tom. "I only
hope I get a chance to use it now."

"I thought you were going to Africa after elephants," spoke Mr.
Swift.

"Well, I did think of it," admitted Tom, "but I haven't made any
definite plans. But come into the house, Ned, and I'll show you more
in detail how my rifle works."

Thereupon the two chums spent some time going into the mysteries of
the new weapon. Mr. Swift and Mr. Jackson were also much interested,
for, though they had seen the gun previously and had helped Tom
perfect it, they had not yet tired of discussing its merits.

Ned stayed quite late that night, and promised to come over the next
day, and watch Tom do some more shooting.

"I'll show you how to use it, too," promised the young inventor, and
he was as good as his word, initiating Ned into the mysteries of the
electric rifle, and showing him to store the charges of death-dealing
electricity in the queer-looking stock.

For a week after that Tom and Ned practiced with the terrible gun,
taking care not to have any more mishaps like the one that had
marked the first night. They were both good shots with ordinary
weapons and it was not long before they had equaled their record
with the new instrument.

It was one warm afternoon, when Tom was out in the meadow at one
side of his house, practicing with his rifle on some big boxes he
had set up for targets, that he saw an elderly man standing close to
the fence watching him. When Tom blew to pieces a particularly large
packing-case, standing a long distance away from it, the stranger
called to the youth.

"I beg your pardon," he said, "but is that a dynamite gun you are
using?"

"No, it's an electric rifle," was the answer.

"Would you mind telling me something about it?" went on the elderly
man, and as Tom's weapon was now fully protected by patents, the
young inventor cordially invited the stranger to come nearer and see
how it worked.

"That's the greatest thing I ever saw!" exclaimed the man
enthusiastically when Tom had blown up another box, and had told of
the illumination for night firing. "The most wonderful weapon I ever
heard of! What a gun it would be in my business."

"What is your trade?" asked Tom curiously, for he had noted that the
man, while aged, was rugged and hearty, and his skin was tanned a
leathery brown, showing that he was much in the open air.

"I'm a hunter," was the reply, "a hunter of big game, principally
elephants, hippos and rhinoceroses. I've just finished a season in
Africa, and I'm going back there again soon. I came on to New York
to get a new elephant gun. I've got a sister living over in
Waterford, and I've been visiting her. I went out for a stroll
to-day, and I came farther than I intended. That's how I happened to be
passing here."

"A sister in Waterford, eh?" mused Tom, wondering whether the
elephant hunter had met Mr. Damon. "And how soon are you going hack
to Africa, Mr.--er--" and Tom hesitated.

"Durban is my name, Alexander Durban," said the old man. "Why, I am
to start back in a few weeks. I've got an order for a pair of big
elephant tusks--the largest I can get for a wealthy New York man,--and
I'm anxious to fulfil the contract. The game isn't what it once
was. There's more competition and the elephants are scarcer. So I've
got to hustle."

"I got me a new gun. But my! it's nothing to what yours is. With
that weapon I could do about as I pleased. I could do night hunting,
which is hard in the African jungle. Then I wouldn't have any
trouble getting the big tusks I'm after. I could get a pair of them,
and live easy the rest of my life. Yes, I wouldn't ask anything
better than a gun like yours. But I s'pose they cost like the
mischief?" He looked a question at Tom.

"This is the only one there is," was the lad's answer. "But I am
very glad to have met you, Mr. Durban. Won't you come into the
house? I'm sure my father will be glad to see you, and I have
something I'd like to talk to you about," and Tom, with many wild
ideas in his head, led the old elephant hunter toward the house.

The dream of the young inventor might come true after all.




CHAPTER V

RUSH WORK


Mr. Swift made the African hunter warmly welcome, and listened with
pride to the words of praise Mr. Durban bestowed on Tom regarding
the rifle.

"Yes, my boy has certainly done wonders along the inventive line,"
said Mr. Swift.

"Not half as much as you have, Dad," interrupted the lad, for Tom
was a modest youth.

"You should see his sky racer," went on the old inventor.

"Sky racer? What's that?" asked Mr. Durban. "Is it another kind of
gun or cannon?"

"It's an aeroplane--an airship," explained Mr. Swift.

"An airship!" exclaimed the old elephant hunter. "Say, you don't
mean that you make balloons, do you?"

"Well, they're not exactly balloons," replied Tom, as he briefly
explained what an aeroplane was, for Mr. Durban, having been in the
wilds of the jungle so much, had had very little chance to see the
wonders and progress of civilization.

"They are better than balloons," went on Tom, "for they can go where
you want them to."

"Say! That's the very thing!" cried the old hunter enthusiastically.
"If there's one thing more than another that is needed in hunting in
Africa it's an airship. The travel through the jungle is something
fierce, and that, more than anything else, interferes with my work.
I can't cover ground enough, and when I do get on the track of a
herd of elephants, and they get away, it's sometimes a week before I
can catch up to them again."

"For, in spite of their size, elephants can travel very fast, and
once they get on the go, nothing can stop them. An airship would be
the very thing to hunt elephants with in Africa--an airship and this
electric rifle. I wonder why you haven't thought of going, Tom
Swift."

"I have thought of it," answered the young inventor, "and that's why
I asked you in. I want to talk about it."

"Do you mean you want to go?" demanded the old man eagerly.

"I certainly do!"

"Then I'm your man! Say, Tom Swift, I'd be proud to have you go to
Africa with me. I'd be proud to have you a member of my hunting
party, and, though I don't like to boast, still if you'll ask any of
the big-game people they'll tell you that not every one can
accompany Aleck Durban."

Tom realized that he was speaking to an authority and a most
desirable companion, should he go to Africa, and he was very glad of
the chance that had made him acquainted with the veteran hunter.

"Will you go with me?" asked Mr. Durban. "You and your electric gun
and your airship? Will you come to Africa to hunt elephants, and
help me get the big tusks I'm after?"

"I will!" exclaimed Tom.

"Then we'll start at once. There's no need of delaying here any
longer."

"Oh, but I haven't an airship ready," said the young inventor. The
face of the old hunter expressed his disappointment.

"Then we'll have to give up the scheme," he said ruefully.

"Not at all," Tom told him. "I have all the material on hand for
building a new airship. I have had it in mind for some time, and I
have done some work on it. I stopped it to perfect my electric
rifle, but, now that is done, I'll tackle the Black Hawk again, and
rush that to completion."

"The Black Hawk?" repeated Mr. Durban, wonderingly.

"Yes, that's what I will name my new craft. The RED CLOUD was
destroyed, and so I thought I'd change the color this time, and
avoid bad luck."

"Good!" exclaimed the hunter. "When do you think you can have it
finished?"

"Oh, possibly in a month--perhaps sooner, and then we will go to
Africa and hunt elephants!"

"Bless my ivory paper cutter!" exclaimed a voice in the hall just
outside the library. "Bless my fingernails! But who's talking about
going to Africa?"

The old hunter looked at Tom and his father in surprise, but the
young inventor laughing and going to the door, called out:

"Come on in, Mr. Damon. I didn't hear you ring. There is some one
here from your town."

"Is it my wife?" asked the odd gentleman who was always blessing
something. "She said she was going to her mother's to spend a few
weeks, and so I thought I'd come over here and see if you had
anything new on the program. The first thing I hear is that you are
going to Africa. And so there's some one from Waterford in there,
eh? Is it my wife?"

"No," answered Tom with another laugh. "Come on in Mr. Damon."

"Bless my toothpick!" exclaimed the odd gentleman, as he saw the
grizzled elephant hunter sitting between Tom and Mr. Swift. "I have
seen you somewhere before, my dear sir."

"Yes," admitted Mr. Durban, "if you're from Waterford you have
probably seen me traveling about the streets there. I'm stopping
with my sister, Mrs. Douglass, but I can't stand it to be in the
house much, so I'm out of doors, wandering about a good bit of the
time. I miss my jungle. But we'll soon be in Africa, Tom Swift and
me."

"Is it possible, Tom?" asked Mr. Damon. "Bless my diamond mines! but
what are you going to do next?"

"It's hard to say," was the answer. "But you came just in time. Mr.
Damon. I'm going to rush work on the Black Hawk, my newest airship,
and we'll leave for elephant land inside of a month, taking my new
electric rifle along. Will you come?"

"Bless my penknife! I never thought of such a thing. I--I--guess--no,
I don't know about it--yes, I'll go!" he suddenly exclaimed.
"I'll go! Hurrah for the elephants!" and he jumped up and shook
hands in turn with Mr. Durban, to whom he had been formally
introduced, and with Tom and Mr. Swift.

"Then it's all settled but the details," declared the youth, "and
now I'll call in Mr. Jackson, and we'll talk about how soon we can
have the airship ready."

"My, but you folks are almost as speedy as a herd of the big
elephants themselves!" exclaimed Mr. Durban, and with the advent of
the engineer the talk turned to things mechanical among Tom and Mr.
Jackson and Mr. Damon, while Mr. Durban told Mr. Swift hunting
stories which the old inventor greatly enjoyed.

The next day Tom engaged two machinists who had worked for him
building airships before, and in the next week rush work began on
the new Black Hawk. Meanwhile Mr. Durban was a frequent visitor at
Tom's home, where he learned to use the new rifle, declaring it was
even more wonderful than he had at first supposed.

"That will get the elephants!" he exclaimed. It did, as you shall
soon learn, and it also was the means of saving several lives in the
wilds of the African jungle.




CHAPTER VI

NEWS FROM ANDY


Tom Swift's former airship, the Red Cloud, had been such a fine
craft, and had done such good service that he thought, in building a
successor, that he could do no better than to follow the design of
the skyship which had been destroyed in the ice caves. But, on
talking with the old elephant hunter, and learning something of the
peculiarities of the African jungle the young inventor decided on
certain changes.

In general the Black Hawk would be on the lines of the Red Cloud but
it would be smaller and lighter and would also be capable of swifter
motion.

"You want it so that it will rise and descend quickly and at sharp
angles," said Mr. Durban.

"Why," inquired Tom.

"Because in Africa, at least in the part where we will go, there are
wide patches of jungle and forest, with here and there big open
places. If you are skimming along close to the ground, in an open
place, in pursuit of a herd of elephants and they should suddenly
plunge into the forest, you would want to be able to rise above the
trees quickly."

"That's so," admitted Tom. "Then I'll have to use a smaller gas bag
than we had on the other ship, for the air resistance to that big
one made us go slowly at times."

"Will it be as safe with a small bag?" Mr. Damon wanted to know.

"Yes, for I will use a more powerful gas, so that we will be more
quickly lifted," said the young inventor. "I will also retain the
aeroplane feature, so that the Black Hawk will be a combined biplane
and dirigible balloon. But it will have many new features. I have
the plans all drawn for a new style of gas generating apparatus, and
I think it can be made in time."

There were busy days about the Swift home. Mrs. Baggert, the
housekeeper, was in despair. She said the good meals she got ready
were wasted, because no one would come to table when they were
ready. She would ring the bell, and announce that dinner would be
served in five minutes.

Then Tom would shout from his workshop that he could not leave until
he had inserted a certain lever in place. Mr. Jackson would
positively decline to sit down until he had screwed fast some part
of a machine. Even Mr. Swift, who, because of his recent illness,
was not allowed to do much, would often delay his meal to test some
new style of gears.

As for Mr. Damon, it was to be expected that he would be eccentric
as he always was. He was not an expert mechanic, but he knew
something of machinery and was of considerable help to Tom in the
rush work on the airship. He would hear the dinner bell ring, and
would exclaim:

"Bless my napkin ring! I can't come now. I have to fix up this
electrical register first."

And so it would go. Eradicate and Boomerang, his mule, were the only
ones who ate regularly, and they always insisted on stopping at
exactly twelve o'clock to partake of the noonday meal.

"'Cause ef I didn't," explained the colored man, "dat contrary mule
ob mine would lay down in de dust ob de road an' not move a step,
lessen' he got his oats. So dat's why we has t' eat, him an' me."

"Well, I'm glad there's some one who's got sense," murmured Mrs.
Baggert. Eradicate and Boomerang were of great service in the
hurried work that followed, for the colored man in his cart brought
from town, or from the freight depot, many things that Tom needed.

The young inventor was very enthusiastic about his proposed trip,
and at night, after a hard day's work in the shop, he would read
books on African hunting, or he would sit and listen to the stories
told by Mr. Durban. And the latter knew how to tell hunting tales,
for he had been long in his dangerous calling, and had had many
narrow escapes.

"And there are other dangers than from elephants and wild beasts in
Africa," he said.

"Bless my toothbrush!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Do you mean cannibals,
Mr. Durban?"

"Some cannibals," was the reply. "But they're not the worst. I mean
the red pygmies. I hope we don't get into their clutches."

"Red pygmies!" repeated Tom, wonderingly.

"Yes, they're a tribe of little creatures, about three feet high,
covered with thick reddish hair, who live in the central part of
Africa, near some of the best elephant-hunting ground. They are
wild, savage and ferocious, and what they lack individually in
strength, they make up in numbers. They're like little red apes, and
woe betide the unlucky hunter who falls into their merciless hands.
They treat him worse than the cannibals do."

"Then we'll look out for them," said Tom. "But I fancy my electric
rifle will make them give us a wide berth."

"It's a great gun," admitted the old hunter with a shake of his
head, "but those red pygmies are terrible creatures. I hope we don't
get them on our trail. But tell me, Tom, how are you coming on with
the airship? for I don't know much about mechanics, and to me it
looks as if it would never be put together. It's like one of those
queer puzzles I've seen 'em selling in the streets of London."

"Oh, it's nearer ready than it looks to be," said Tom. "We'll have
it assembled, and ready for a trial in about two weeks more."

Work on the Black Hawk was rushed more than ever in the next few
days, another extra machinist being engaged. Then the craft began to
assume shape and form, and with the gas bag partly inflated and the
big planes stretching out from either side, it began to look
something like the ill-fated Red Cloud.

"It's going to be a fine ship!" cried Tom enthusiastically, one day,
as he went to the far side of the ship to get a perspective view of
it. "We'll make good time in this."

"Are you going to sail all the way to Africa--across the ocean--in
her?" asked Mr. Durban, in somewhat apprehensive tones.

"Oh, no," replied Tom. "I believe she would be capable of taking us
across the ocean, but there is no need of running any unnecessary
risks. I want to get her safely to Africa, and have her do stunts in
elephant land."

"Then what are your plans?" asked the hunter.

"We'll put her together here," said Tom, "give her a good try-out to
see that she works well, and then pack her up for shipment to the
African coast by steamer. We'll go on the same ship, and when we
arrive we'll put the Black Hawk together again, and set sail for the
interior."

"Good idea," commented Mr. Durban. "Now, if you've no objections,
I'm going to do a little practice with the electric rifle."

"Go ahead," assented Tom. "There comes Ned Newton; he'll be glad of
a chance for a few shots while I work on this new propeller motor.
It just doesn't suit me."

The bank clerk, who had arranged to go to Africa with Tom, was seen
advancing toward the aeroplane shed. In his hand Ned held a paper,
and as he saw Tom he called out:

"Have you heard the news?"

"What news?" inquired the young inventor.

"About Andy Foger. He and his aeroplane are lost!"

"Lost!" cried Tom, for in spite of the mean way the bully had
treated him our hero did not wish him any harm.

"Well, not exactly lost," went on Ned, as he held out the paper to
Tom, "but he and his sky-craft have disappeared."

"Disappeared?"

"Yes. You know he and that German, Mr. Landbacher, went over to
Europe to give some aviation exhibitions. Well, I see by this paper
that they went to Egypt, and were doing a high-flying stunt there,
when a gale sprang up, they lost control of the aeroplane and it was
swept out of sight."

"In which direction; out to sea?"

"No, toward the interior of Africa."

"Toward the interior of Africa!" cried Tom. "And that's where we're
going in a couple of weeks. Andy in Africa!"

"'Maybe we'll see him there," suggested Ned.

"Well, I certainly hope we do not!" exclaimed Tom, as he turned back
to his work, with an undefinable sense of fear in his heart.




CHAPTER VII

THE BLACK HAWK FLIES


It was with no little surprise that the news of the plight that was
said to have befallen Andy Foger was received by Tom and his
associates. The newspaper had quite an account of the affair, and,
even allowing the usual discount for the press dispatches, it looked
as if the former bully was in rather distressing circumstances.

"He won't have to be carried very far into Africa to be in a bad
country," said the old hunter. "Of course, some parts of the
continent are all right, and for me, I like it all, where there's
hunting to be had. But I guess your young friend Foger won't care
for it."

"He's no friend of ours," declared Ned, as Tom was reading the
newspaper account. "Still, I don't wish him any bad luck, and I do
hope he doesn't become the captive of the red pygmies."

"So do I," echoed the old hunter fervently. There was no news of
Andy in the papers the next day, though there were cable dispatches
speculating on what might have happened to him and the airship. In
Shopton the dispatches created no little comment, and it was said
that Mr. Foger was going to start for Africa at once to rescue his
son. This, however, could not be confirmed.

Meanwhile Tom and his friends were very busy over the Black Hawk.
Every hour saw the craft nearer completion, for the young inventor
had had much experience in this sort of work now, and knew just how
to proceed.

To Mr. Damon were intrusted certain things which he could well
attend to, and though he frequently stopped to bless his necktie or
his shoelaces, still he got along fairly well.

There would be no necessity of purchasing supplies in this country,
for they could get all they needed in the African city of Majumba,
on the western coast, where they planned to land. There the airship
would be put together, stocked with provisions and supplies, and
they would begin their journey inland. They planned to head for Buka
Meala, crossing the Congo River, and then go into the very interior
of the heart of the dark continent.

As we have described in detail, in the former books of this series,
the construction of Tom Swift's airship, the Red Cloud, and as the
Black Hawk was made in a similar manner to that, we will devote but
brief space to it now. As the story proceeds, and the need arises
for a description of certain features, we will give them to you, so
that you will have a clear idea of what a wonderful craft it was.

Sufficient to say that there was a gas bag, made of a light but
strong material, and capable of holding enough vapor, of a new and
secret composition, to lift the airship with its load. This was the
dirigible-balloon feature of the craft, and with the two powerful
propellers, fore and aft (in which particular the Black Hawk
differed from the Red Cloud which had two forward propellers);--with
these two powerful wooden screws, as we have said, the new ship
could travel swiftly without depending on the wing planes.

But as there is always a possibility of the gas bag being punctured,
or the vapor suddenly escaping from one cause or another, Tom did
not depend on this alone to keep his craft afloat. It was a perfect
aeroplane, and with the gas bag entirely empty could be sent
scudding along at any height desired. To enable it to rise by means
of the wings, however, it was necessary to start it in motion along
the ground, and for this purpose wheels were provided.

There was a large body or car to the craft, suspended from beneath
the gas bag, and in this car were the cabins, the living, sleeping
and eating apartments, the storerooms and the engine compartment.

This last was a marvel of skill, for it contained besides the gas
machine, and the motor for working the propellers, dynamos, gages,
and instruments for telling the speed and height, motors for doing
various pieces of work, levers, wheels, cogs, gears, tanks for
storing the lifting gas, and other features of interest.

There were several staterooms for the use of the young captain and
the passengers, an observation and steering tower, a living-room,
where they could all assemble as the ship was sailing through the
air, and a completely equipped kitchen.

This last was Mr. Damon's special pride, as he was a sort of cook,
and he liked nothing better than to get up a meal when the craft was
two or three miles high, and scudding along at seventy-five miles an
hour.

In addition there were to be taken along many scientific
instruments, weapons of defense and offense, in addition to the
electric rifle, and various other objects which will be spoken of in
due time.

"Well," remarked Tom Swift one afternoon, following a hard day's
work in the shop, "I think, if all goes well, and we have good
weather, I'll give the Black Hawk a trial tomorrow."

"Do you think it will fly?" asked Ned.

"There is no telling," was the answer of the young inventor. "These
things are more or less guesswork, even when you make two exactly
alike. As far as I can tell, we have now a better craft than the Red
Cloud was, but it remains to be seen how she will behave."

They worked late that night, putting the finishing touches on the
Black Hawk, and in the morning the new airship was wheeled out of
the shed, and placed on the level starting ground, ready for the
trial flight.

Only the bare machinery was in her, as yet, and the gas bag had not
been inflated as Tom wanted to try the plane feature first. But the
vapor machine was all ready to start generating the gas whenever it
was needed. Nor was the Black Hawk painted and decorated as she
would be when ready to be sent to Africa. On the whole, she looked
rather crude as she rested there on the bicycle wheels, awaiting the
starting of the big propellers. As the stores and supplies were not
yet in, Tom took aboard, in addition to Mr. Damon, Ned, his father,
Mr. Jackson and Mr. Durban, some bags of sand to represent the extra
weight that would have to be carried.

"If she'll rise with this load she'll do," announced the young
inventor, as he went carefully over the craft, looking to see that
everything was in shape.

"If she does rise it will be a new experience for me," spoke the old
elephant hunter. "I've never been in an airship before. It doesn't
seem possible that we can get up in the air with this machine."

"Maybe we won't," spoke Tom, who was always a little diffident about
a new piece of machinery.

"Well, if it doesn't do it the first time, it will the second, or
the fifty-second," declared Ned Newton. "Tom Swift doesn't give up
until he succeeds."

"Stop it! You'll make me blush!" cried the Black Hawk's owner as he
tried the different gages and levers to see that they were all
right.

After what seemed like a long time he gave the word for those who
were to make the trial trip to take their places. They did so, and
then, with Mr. Jackson, Tom went to the engine room. There was a
little delay, due to the fact that some adjustment was necessary on
the main motor. But at last it was fixed.

"Are you all ready?" called Tom.

"All ready," answered Mr. Damon. The old elephant hunter sat in a
chair, nervously gripping the arms, and with a grim look on his
tanned face. Mr. Swift was cool, as Ned, for they had made many
trips in the air. Outside were Eradicate Sampson and Mrs. Baggert.

"Here we go!" suddenly cried Tom, and he yanked over the lever that
started the main motor and propellers. The Black Hawk trembled
throughout her entire length. She shivered and shook. Faster and
faster whirled the great wooden screws. The motor hummed and
throbbed.

Slowly the Black Hawk moved across the ground. Then she gathered
speed. Now she was fairly rushing over the level space. Tom Swift
tilted the elevation rudder, and with a suddenness that was
startling, at least to the old elephant hunter, the new airship shot
upward on a steep slant.

"The Black Hawk flies!" yelled Ned Newton. "Now for elephant land
and the big tusks!"

"Yes, and perhaps for the red pygmies, too," added Tom in a low
voice. Then he gave his whole attention to the management of his new
machine, which was rapidly mounting upward, with a speed rivalling
that of his former big craft.




CHAPTER VIII

OFF FOR AFRICA


Higher and higher went the Black Hawk, far above the earth, until
the old elephant hunter, looking down, said in a voice which he
tried to make calm and collected, but which trembled in spite of
himself:

"Of course I'm not an expert at this game, Tom Swift, but it looks
to me as if we'd never get down. Don't you think we're high enough?"

"For the time being, yes," answered the young inventor. "I didn't
think she'd climb so far without the use of the gas. She's doing
well."

"Bless my topknot, yes!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "She beats the Red
Cloud, Tom. Try her on a straight-away course."

Which the youth did, pointing the nose of the craft along parallel
to the surface of the earth, and nearly a mile above it. Then,
increasing the speed of the motor, and with the big propellers
humming, they made fast time.

The old elephant hunter grew more calm as he saw that the airship
did not show any inclination to fall, and he noted that Tom and the
others not only knew how to manage it, but took their flight as much
a matter of course as if they were in an automobile skimming along
on the surface of the ground.

Tom put his craft through a number of evolutions, and when he found
that she was in perfect control as an aeroplane, he started the gas
machine, filled the big black bag overhead, and, when it was
sufficiently buoyant, he shut off the motor, and the Black Hawk
floated along like a balloon.

"That's what we'll do if our power happens to give out when we get
over an African jungle, with a whole lot of wild elephants down
below, and a forest full of the red pygmies waiting for us,"
explained Tom to Mr. Durban.

"And I guess you'll need to do it, too," answered the hunter. "I
don't know which I fear worse, the bad elephants wild with rage, as
they get some times, or the little red men who are as strong as
gorillas, and as savage as wolves. It would be all up with us if we
got into their hands. But I think this airship will be just what we
need in Africa. I'd have been able to get out of many a tight place
if I had had one on my last trip."

While the Black Hawk hung thus, up the air, not moving, save as the
wind blew her, Tom with his father and Mr. Jackson made an
inspection of the machinery to find out whether it had been strained
any. They found that it had worked perfectly, and soon the craft was
in motion again, her nose this time being pointed toward the earth.
Tom let out some of the gas, and soon the airship was on the ground
in front of the shed she had so recently left.

"She's all right," decided the young inventor after a careful
inspection. "I'll give her a couple more trials, put on the
finishing touches and then we'll be ready for our trip to Africa.
Have you got everything arranged to go, Ned?"

"Sure. I have a leave of absence from the bank, thanks to your
father and Mr. Damon, most of my clothes are packed, I've bought a
gun and I've got a lot of quinine in case I get a fever."

"Good!" cried the elephant hunter. "You'll do all right, I reckon.
I'm glad I met you young fellows. Well, I've lived through my first
trip in the air, which is more than I expected when I started."

They discussed their plans at some length, for, now that the airship
had proved all that they had hoped for, it would not be long ere
they were under way. In the days that followed Tom put the finishing
touches on the craft, arranged to have it packed up for shipment,
and spent some time practicing with his electric rifle. He got to be
an expert shot, and Mr. Durban, who was a wonder with the ordinary
rifle, praised the young inventor highly.

"There won't be many of the big tuskers get away from you, Tom Swift,"
he said. "And that reminds me, I got a letter the other day, from
the firm I collect ivory for, stating that the price had risen
because of a scarcity, and urging me to hurry back to Africa and get
all I could. It seems that war has broken out among some of the
central African tribes, and they are journeying about in the jungle,
on the war path here and there, and have driven the elephants into
the very deepest wilds, where the ordinary hunters can't get at
them."

"Maybe we won't have any luck, either," suggested Ned.

"Oh, yes, we will," declared the hunter. "With our airship, the
worst forest of the dark continent won't have any terrors for us,
for we can float above it. And the fights of the natives won't have
any effect. In a way, this will be a good thing, for with the price
of ivory soaring, we can make more money than otherwise. There's a
chance for us all to get a lot of money."

"Bless my piano keys!" exclaimed Mr. Damon, "if I can get just one
elephant, and pull out his big ivory teeth, I'll be satisfied. I
want a nice pair of tusks to set up on either side of my fireplace
for ornaments."

"A mighty queer place for such-like ornaments," said Mr. Durban in a
low voice. Then he added: "Well, the sooner we get started the
better I'll like it, for I want to get that pair of big tusks for a
special customer of mine."

"I'll give the Black Hawk one more trial flight, and then take her
apart and ship her," decided Tom, and the final flight, a most
successful one, took place the following day.

Then came another busy season when the airship was taken apart for
shipment to the coast of Africa by steamer. It was put into big
boxes and crates, and Eradicate and his mule took them to the
station in Shopton.

"Don't you want to come to Africa with us, Rad?" asked Tom, when the
last of the cases had been sent off. "You'll find a lot of your
friends there."

"No, indeedy, I doan't want t' go," answered the colored man,
"though I would like to see dat country."

"Then why don't you come?"

"Hu! Yo' think, Massa Tom, dat I go anywhere dat I might meet dem
little red men what Massa Durban talk about? No, sah, dey might hurt
mah mule Boomerang."

"Oh, I wasn't going to take the mule along," said Tom, wondering how
the creature might behave in the airship.

"Not take Boomerang? Den I SUTTINLY ain't goin," and Eradicate
walked off, highly offended, to give some oats to his faithful if
somewhat eccentric steed.

After the airship had been sent off there yet remained much for Tom
Swift to do. He had to send along a number of special tools and
appliances with which to put the ship together again, and also some
with which to repair the craft in case of accident. So that this
time was pretty well occupied. But at length everything was in
readiness, and with his electric rifle knocked down for
transportation, and with his baggage, and that of the others, all
packed, they set off one morning to take the train for New York,
where they would get a steamer for Africa.

Numerous good-bys had been said, and Tom had made a farewell call on
Mary Nestor, promising to bring her some trophy from elephant land,
though he did not quite know what it would be.

Mr. Damon, as the train started, blessed everything he could think
of. Mr. Swift waved his hand and wished his son and the others good
luck, feeling a little lonesome that he could not make one of the
party. Ned was eager with excitement, and anticipation of what lay
before him. Tom Swift was thinking of what he could accomplish with
his electric rifle, and of the wonderful sights he would see, and,
as for the old elephant hunter, he was very glad to be on the move
again, after so many weeks of idleness, for he was a very active
man.

Their journey to New York was uneventful, and they found that the
parts of the airship had safely arrived, and had been taken aboard
the steamer. The little party went aboard themselves, after a day
spent in sight-seeing, and that afternoon the Soudalar, which was
the vessel's name, steamed away from the dock at high tide.

"Off for Africa!" exclaimed Tom to Ned, as they stood at the rail,
watching the usual crowd wave farewells. "Off for Africa, Ned."

As Tom spoke, a gentleman who had been standing near him and his
chum, vigorously waving his hand to some one on the pier, turned
quickly. He looked sharply at the young inventor for a moment, and
then exclaimed:

"Well, if it isn't Tom Swift! Did I hear you say you were going to
Africa?"

Tom looked at the gentleman with rather a puzzled air for a moment.
The face was vaguely familiar, but Tom could not recall where he had
seen it. Then it came to him in a flash.

"Mr. Floyd Anderson!" exclaimed our hero. "Mr. Anderson of--"

"Earthquake Island!" exclaimed the gentleman quickly, as he extended
his hand. "I guess you remember that place, Tom Swift."

"Indeed I do. And to think of meeting you again, and on this African
steamer," and Tom's mind went back to the perilous days when his
wireless message had saved the castaways of Earthquake Island, among
whom were Mr. Anderson and his wife.

"Did I hear you say you were going to Africa?" asked Mr. Anderson,
when he had been introduced to Ned, and the others in Tom's party.

"That's where we're bound for," answered the lad. "We are going to
elephant land. But where are you going, Mr. Anderson?"

"Also to Africa, but not on a trip for pleasure or profit like
yourselves. I have been commissioned by a missionary society to
rescue two of its workers from the heart of the dark continent."

"Rescue two missionaries?" exclaimed Tom, wonderingly.

"Yes, a gentleman and his wife, who, it is reported, have fallen
into the hands of a race known as the red pygmies, who hold them
captives!"




CHAPTER IX

ATTACKED BY A WHALE


Surprise at Mr. Anderson's announcement held Tom silent for a
moment. That the gentleman whom he had been the means of rescuing,
among others, from Earthquake Island, should be met with so
unexpectedly, was quite a coincidence, but when it developed that he
was bound to the same part of the African continent as were Tom and
his friends, and when he said he hoped to rescue some missionaries
from the very red pygmies so feared by the old elephant hunter--this
was enough to startle any one.

"I see that my announcement has astonished you," said Mr. Anderson,
as he noted the look of surprise on the face of the young inventor.

"It certainly has! Why, that's where we are bound for, in my new
airship. Come down into our cabin, Mr. Anderson, and tell us all
about it. Is your wife with you?"

"No, it is too dangerous a journey on which to take her. I have
little hope of succeeding, for it is now some time since the
unfortunate missionaries were captured, but I am going to do my
best, and organize a relief expedition when I get to Africa."

Tom said nothing at that moment, but he made up his mind that if it
was at all possible he would lend his aid, that of his airship, and
also get his friends to assist Mr. Anderson. They went below to a
special cabin that had been reserved for Tom's party, and there, as
the ship slowly passed down New York Bay, Mr. Anderson told his
story.

"I mentioned to you, when we were on Earthquake Island," he said to
Tom, "that I had been in Africa, and had done some hunting. That is
not my calling, as it is that of your friend, Mr. Durban, but I know
the country pretty well. However, I have not been there in some
time."

"My wife and I are connected with a church in New York that, several
years ago, raised a fund and sent two missionaries, Mr. and Mrs.
Jacob Illingway, to the heart of Africa. They built up a little
mission there, and for a time all went well, and they did good work
among the natives."

"They are established in a tribe of friendly black men, of simple
nature, and, while the natives did not become Christianized to any
remarkable extent, yet they were kind to the missionaries. Mr. and
Mrs. Illingway used frequently to write to members of our church,
telling of their work. They also mentioned the fact that adjoining
the country of the friendly blacks there was a tribe of fierce
little red men,--red because of hair of that color all over their
bodies."

"That's right," agreed Mr. Durban, shaking his head solemnly.
"They're red imps, too!"

"Mr. Illingway often mentioned in his letters," went on Mr.
Anderson, "that there were frequent fights between the pygmies and
the race of blacks, but the latter had no great fear of their small
enemies. However, it seems that they did not take proper
precautions, for not long ago there was a great battle, the blacks
were attacked by a large force of the red pygmies, who overwhelmed
them by numbers, and finally routed them, taking possession of their
country."

"What became of the missionaries?" asked Ned Newton.

"I'll tell you," said Mr. Anderson. "For a long time we heard
nothing, beyond the mere news of the fight, which we read of in the
papers. The church people were very anxious about the fate of Mr.
and Mrs. Illingway, and were talking of sending a special messenger
to inquire about them, when a cablegram came from the headquarters
of the society in London."

"It seems that one of the black natives, named Tomba, who was a sort
of house servant to Mr. and Mrs. Illingway, escaped the general
massacre, in which all his friends were killed. He made his way
through the jungle to a white settlement, and told his story,
relating how the two missionaries had been carried away captive by
the pygmies."

"A terrible fate," commented Mr. Durban.

"Yes, they might better be dead, from all the accounts we can hear,"
went on Mr. Anderson.

"Bless my Sunday hat! Don't say that!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Maybe
we can save them, Mr. Anderson."

"That is what I am going to try to do, though it may be too late. As
soon as definite news was received, our church held a meeting,
raised a fund, and decided to send me off to find Mr. and Mrs.
Illingway, if alive, or give them decent burial, if I could locate
their bones. The reason they selected me was because I had been in
Africa, and knew the country."

"I made hurried arrangements, packed up, said good-by to my wife,
and here I am. But to think of meeting you, Tom Swift! And to hear
that you are also going to Africa. I wish I could command an airship
for the rescue. It might be more easily accomplished!"

"That's just what I was going to propose!" exclaimed Tom. "We are
going to the land of the red pygmies, and while I have promised to
help Mr. Durban in getting ivory, and while I want to try my
electric rifle on big game, still we can do both, I think. You can
depend on us, Mr. Anderson, and if the Black Hawk can be of any
service to you in the rescue, count us in!"

"Gosh!" cried the former castaway of Earthquake Island. "This is the
best piece of luck I could have! Now tell me all about your plans."
which Tom and the others did, listening in turn, to further details
about the missionaries.

Just how they would go to work to effect the rescue, or how they
could locate the particular tribe of little red men who had Mr. and
Mrs. Illingway, they did not know.

"We may be able to get hold of this Tomba," said Mr. Durban. "If not
I guess between Mr. Anderson and myself we can get on the trail,
somehow. I'm anxious to get to the coast, see the airship put
together again, and start for the interior."

"So am I," declared Tom, as he got out his electric rifle, and began
to put it together, for he wanted to show Mr. Anderson how it
worked.

They had a pleasant and uneventful voyage for two weeks. The weather
was good, and, to tell the truth, it was rather monotonous for Tom
and the others, who were eager to get into activity again. Then came
a storm, which, while it was not dangerous, yet gave them plenty to
think and talk about for three days. Then came more calm weather,
when the Soudalar plowed along over gently heaving billows.

They were about a week from their port of destination, which was
Majumba, on the African coast, when, one afternoon, as Tom and the
others were in their cabin, they heard a series of shouts on deck,
and the sound of many feet running to and fro.

"Something has happened!" exclaimed the young inventor.

Tom raced for the companionway, and was soon on deck, followed by
Mr. Durban and the others. They saw a crowd of sailors and
passengers leaning over the port rail.

"What's the matter?" asked Tom, of the second mate, who was just
passing.

"Fight between a killer and a whale," was the reply. "The captain
has ordered the ship to lay-to so it can be watched."

Tom made his way to the rail. About a quarter of a mile away there
could be observed a great commotion in the ocean. Great bodies
seemed to be threshing about, beating the water to foam, and, with
the foam could be seen bright blood mingled. Occasionally two jets
of water, as from some small fountain, would shoot upward.

"He's blowing hard!" exclaimed one of the sailors. "I guess he's
about done for!"

"Which one?" asked Tom.

"The whale," was the reply. "The killer has the best of the big
fellow," and the sailor quickly explained how the smaller killer
fish, by the peculiarity of its attack, and its great ferocity,
often bested its larger antagonist.

The battle was now at its height, and Tom and the others were
interested spectators. At times neither of the big creatures could
be seen, because of the smother of foam in which they rolled and
threshed about. The whale endeavored to sound, or go to the bottom,
but the killer stuck to him relentlessly.

Suddenly, however, as Tom looked, the whale, by a stroke of his
broad tail, momentarily stunned his antagonist. Instantly realizing
that he was free the great creature, which was about ninety feet
long, darted away, swimming on the surface of the water, for he
needed to get all the air possible.

Quickly acquiring momentum, the whale came on like a locomotive,
spouting at intervals, the vapor from the blowholes looking not
unlike steam from some submarine boat.

"He looks to be heading this way," remarked Mr. Durban to Tom.

"He is," agreed the young inventor, "but I guess he'll dive before
he gets here. He only wants to get away from the killer. Look, the
other one is swimming this way, too!"

"Bless my harpoon, but he sure is!" called Mr. Damon. "They'll renew
the fight near here."

But he was mistaken, for the killer, after coming a little distance
after the whale, suddenly turned, hesitated for a moment, and then
disappeared in the depths of the ocean.

The whale, however, continued to come on, speeding through the water
with powerful strokes. There was an uneasy movement among some of
the passengers.

"Suppose he strikes the ship," suggested one woman.

"Nonsense! He couldn't," said her husband.

"The old man had better get under way, just the same," remarked a
sailor near Tom, as he looked up at the bridge where the captain was
standing.

The "old man," or commander, evidently thought the same thing, for,
after a glance at the oncoming leviathan, which was still headed
directly for the vessel, he shoved the lever of the telegraph signal
over to "full speed ahead."

Hardly had he done so than the whale sank from sight.

"Oh, I'm so glad!" exclaimed the woman who had first spoken of the
possibility of the whale hitting the ship, "I am afraid of those
terrible creatures."

"They're as harmless as a cow, unless they get angry," said her
husband.

Slowly the great ship began to move through the water. Tom and his
friends were about to go back to their cabin, for they thought the
excitement over, when, as the young inventor turned from the rail,
he felt a vibration throughout the whole length of the steamer, as
if it had hit on a sand-bar.

Instantly there was a jangling of bells in the engine room, and the
Soudalar lost headway.

"What's the matter?" asked several persons.

They were answered a moment later, for the big whale, even though
grievously wounded in his fight with the killer, had risen not a
hundred feet away from the ship, and was coming toward it with the
speed of an express train.

"Bless my blubber!" cried Mr. Damon. "We must have hit the whale, or
it hit us under the water and now it's going to attack us!"

He had no more than gotten the words out of his mouth ere the great
creature of the deep came on full tilt at the vessel, struck it a
terrific blow which made it tremble from stem to stern, and careen
violently.

There was a chorus of frightened cries, sailors rushed to and fro,
the engine-room bells rang violently, and the captain and mates
shouted hoarse orders.

"Here he comes again!" yelled Mr. Durban, as he hurried to the side
of the ship. "The whale takes us for an enemy, I guess, and he's
going to ram us again!"

"And if he does it many times, he'll start the plates and cause a
leak that won't be stopped in a hurry!" cried a sailor as he rushed
past Tom.

The young inventor looked at the oncoming monster for a moment, and
then started on the run for his cabin.

"Here! Where are you going?" cried Mr. Damon, but Tom did not
answer.




CHAPTER X

OFF IN THE AIRSHIP


As Tom Swift hurried down the companionway he again felt the ship
careen as the whale struck it a powerful blow, and he was almost
knocked off his feet. But he kept on.

Below he found some frightened men and women, a number of whom were
adjusting life preservers about them, under the impression that the
ship had struck a rock and was going down. They had not been up on
deck, and did not know of the battle between the killer and the
whale, nor what followed.

"Oh, I know we're sinking!" cried one timid woman. "What has
happened?" she appealed to Tom.

"It will be all right in a little while," he assured her.

"But what is it? I want to know. Have we had a collision."

"Yes, with a whale," replied Tom, as he grabbed up something from
his stateroom, and again rushed up on deck. As he reached it the
whale came on once more, and struck the ship another terrific blow.
Then the monster sank and could be seen swimming back, just under
the surface of the water, getting ready to renew the attack.

"He's going to ram us again!" cried Mr. Damon. "Bless my machine
oil! Why doesn't the captain do something?"

At that moment the commander cried from the bridge:

"Send a man below, Mr. Laster, to see if we are making any water.
Then tell half a dozen of the sailors to get out the rifles, and see
if they can't kill the beast. He'll put us in Davy Jones's locker if
he keeps this up! Lively now, men!"

The first mate, Mr. Laster, called out the order. A sailor went
below to see if the ship was leaking much, and the captain rang for
full speed ahead. But the Soudalar was slow in getting under way
again, and, even at top speed she was no match for the whale, which
was again rushing toward the vessel.

"Quick with those rifles!" cried the captain. "Fire a volley into
the beast!"

"There's no need!" suddenly called Mr. Damon, who had caught sight
of Tom Swift, and the object which the lad carried.

"No need?" demanded the commander. "Why, has the whale sunk, or made
off?"

"No," answered the eccentric man, "the whale is still coming on, but
Tom Swift will fix him. Get there, Tom, and let him have a good
one!"

"What sort of a gun is that?" demanded the commander as the young
inventor took his place at the rail, which was now almost deserted.

Tom did not answer. Bracing himself against the rolling and heaving
of the vessel, which was now under about half speed, Tom aimed his
electric rifle at the oncoming leviathan. He looked at the automatic
gage, noted the distance and waiting a moment until the crest of a
wave in front of the whale had subsided, he pressed the button.

If those watching him expected to hear a loud report, and see a
flash of flame, they were disappointed. There was absolutely no
sound, but what happened to the whale was most surprising.

The great animal stopped short amid a swirl of foam, and the next
instant it seemed to disintegrate. It went all to pieces, just as
had the dummy figure which Tom on one occasion fired at with his
rifle and as had the big packing-cases. The whale appeared to
dissolve, as does a lump of sugar in a cup of hot tea, and, five
seconds after Tom Swift had fired his electric gun, there was not a
sign of the monster save a little blood on the calm sea.

"What--what happened?" asked the captain in bewilderment. "Is--is
that monster gone?"

"Completely gone!" cried Mr. Damon. "Bless my powder horn, Tom, but
I knew you could do it!"

"Is that a new kind of whale gun, firing an explosive bullet?"
inquired the commander, as he came down off the bridge and shook
hands with Tom. "If it is, I'd like to buy one. We may be rammed
again by another whale."

"This is my new, electric rifle," explained the young inventor
modestly, "and it fires wireless charges of electricity instead of
bullets. I'm sorry I can't let you have it, as it's the only one I
have. But I guess no more whales will ram us. That one was evidently
crazed by the attack of the killer, and doubtless took us for
another of its enemies."

Sailors and passengers crowded around Tom, eager to shake his hand,
and to hear about the gun. Many declared that he had saved the ship.

This was hardly true, for the whale could not have kept up its
attacks much longer. Still he might have done serious damage, by
causing a leak, and, while the Soudalar was a stanch craft, with
many water-tight compartments, still no captain likes to be a week
from land with a bad leak, especially if a storm comes up. Then,
too, there was the danger of a panic among the passengers, had the
attacks been kept up, so, though Tom wanted to make light of his
feat, the others would not let him.

"You're entitled to the thanks of all on board," declared Captain
Wendon, "and I'll see that the owners hear of what you did. Well, I
guess we can go on, now. I'll not stop again to see a fight between
a killer and a whale."

The steamer resumed her way at full speed, and the sailor, who had
gone below, came up to report that there was only a slight leak,
which need not cause any uneasiness.

Little was talked of for the next few days but the killing of the
whale, and Tom had to give several exhibitions of his electric
rifle, and explain its workings. Then, too, the story of his
expedition became known, and also the object of Mr. Anderson's
quest, and Tom's offer of aid to help rescue the missionaries, so
that, altogether, our hero was made much of during the remainder of
the voyage.

"Well, if your gun will do that to a whale, what will it do to an
elephant?" asked Mr. Durban one morning, when they were within a
day's steaming of their port. "I'm afraid it's almost too strong,
Tom. It will leave nothing--not even the tusks to pick up."

"Oh, I can regulate the power," declared the lad. "I used full force
on the whale, just to see what it would do. It was the first time
I'd tried it on anything alive. I can so regulate the charge that it
will kill even an elephant, and leave scarcely a mark on the beast."

"I'd like to see it done," remarked the old hunter.

"I'll show you, if we sight any sharks," promised Tom. He was able
to keep his word for that afternoon a school of the ugly fish
followed the steamer for the sake of the food scraps thrown
overboard. Tom took his position in the stern, and gave an
exhibition of shooting with his electric gun that satisfied even Mr.
Durban, exacting as he was.

For the lad, by using his heaviest charges, destroyed the largest
sharks so that they seemed to instantly disappear in the water, and
from that he toned down the current until he could kill some of the
monsters so easily and quickly that they seemed to float motionless
on the surface, yet there was no life left in them once the electric
charge touched them.

"We'll use the light charges when we're killing elephants for their
tusks," said Tom, "and the heavy ones when we're in danger from a
rush of the beasts."

He little knew how soon he would have to put his plan into effect.

They arrived safely at Majumba, the African coast city, and for two
days Tom was kept busy superintending the unloading of the parts of
his airship. But it was safely taken ashore, and he and his friends
hired a disused warehouse in which to work at reassembling the Black
Hawk.

Tom had everything down to a system, and, in less than a week the
aircraft was once more ready to be sent aloft. It was given a try-out,
much to the astonishment of the natives, and worked perfectly.
Then Tom and his friends busied themselves laying in a stock of
provisions and stores for the trip into the interior.

They made inquiries about the chances of getting ivory and were told
that they were good if they went far enough into the jungle and
forests, for the big beasts had penetrated farther and farther
inland.

They also tried to get some news regarding the captive missionaries,
but were unsuccessful nor could they learn what had become of Tomba,
who had brought the dire news to civilization.

"It's too soon to hope for anything yet," said Mr. Anderson. "Wait
until we get near the country of the red pygmies."

"And then it may be too late," said Tom in a low voice.

It was two weeks after their arrival in Majumba that Tom announced
that all was in readiness. The airship was in perfect working order,
it was well stocked with food, arms, articles and trinkets with
which to trade among the natives, spare parts for the machinery,
special tools and a good supply of the chemicals needed to
manufacture the lifting gas.

Of course Tom did not leave behind his electric weapon and Mr.
Durban and the others took plenty of ammunition for the ordinary
rifles which they carried.

One morning, after cabling to his father that they were about to
start, Tom gave a last careful look to his airship, tested the motor
and dynamos, took a hasty survey of the storeroom, to see that
nothing had been forgotten, and gave the word to get aboard.

They took their places in the cabin. Outside a crowd of natives, and
white traders of many nationalities had gathered. Tom pulled the
starting lever. The Black Hawk shot across a specially prepared
starting ground, and, attaining sufficient momentum, suddenly arose
into the air.

There was a cheer from the watching crowd, and several superstitious
blacks, who saw the airship for the first time, ran away in terror.

Up into the blue atmosphere Tom took his craft. He looked down on
the city over which he was flying. Then he pointed the prow of the
Black Hawk toward the heart of the dark continent.

"Off for the interior!" he murmured. "I wonder if we'll ever get out
again?"

No one could answer. They had to take their chances with the dangers
and terrors of elephant land, and with the red pygmies. Yet Tom
Swift was not afraid.




CHAPTER XI

ANCHORED TO EARTH


With the voyage on the steamer, their arrival in Africa, the many
strange sights of the city of Majumba, and the refitting of the
airship, our friends had hardly had time to catch their breath since
Tom Swift's determination to go elephant hunting. Now, as the Black
Hawk was speeding into the interior, they felt, for the first time
in many weeks, that they "could take it easy," as Ned Newton
expressed it.

"Thank goodness," said the bank clerk, "I can sit down and look at
something for a while," and he gazed out of the main cabin windows
down at the wild country over which they were then flying.

For, so swiftly had the airship moved that it was hardly any time at
all before it had left Majumba far behind, and was scudding over the
wilderness.

"Bless my camera," exclaimed Mr. Damon, who had brought along one of
the picture machines, "bless my camera! I don't call that much to
look at," and he pointed to the almost impenetrable forest over
which they then were.

"No, it isn't much of a view," said the old elephant hunter, "but
wait. You'll soon see all you want to. Africa isn't all like this.
There are many strange sights before us yet. But, Tom Swift, tell us
how the airship is working in this climate. Do you find any
difficulty managing it?"

"Not at all," answered Tom, who was in the cabin then, having set
the automatic steering apparatus in the pilot house, and come back
to join the others. "It works as well as it did in good old York
State. Of course I can't tell what affect the continual hot and
moist air will have on the gas bag, but I guess we'll make out all
right."

"I certainly hope so," put in Mr. Anderson. "It would be too bad to
be wrecked in the middle of Africa, with no way to get out."

"Oh, you needn't worry about that," said Ned with a laugh. "If the
airship should smash, Tom would build another out of what was left,
and we'd sail away as good as before."

"Hardly that," answered the young inventor.

"But we won't cross a bridge until we hear it coming, as Eradicate
would say. Hello, that looks like some sort of native village."

He pointed ahead to a little clearing in the forest, where a number
of mud and grass huts were scattered about. As they came nearer they
could see the black savages, naked save for a loin cloth, running
about in great excitement, and pointing upward.

"Yes, that's one of the numerous small native villages we'll see
from now on," said Mr. Durban. "Many a night have I spent in those
same grass huts after a day's hunting. Sometimes, I've been
comfortable, and again not. I guess we've given those fellows a
scare."

It did seem so, for by this time the whole population, including
women and children, were running about like mad. Suddenly, from
below there sounded a deep booming noise, which came plainly to the
ears of the elephant hunters through the opened windows of the
airship cabin.

"Hark! What's that?" cried Tom, raising his hand for silence.

"Bless my umbrella! it sounds like thunder," said Mr. Damon.

"No, it's one of their war drums," explained Mr. Durban. "The
natives make large ones out of hollow trees, with animal skins
stretched over the ends, and they beat them to sound a warning, or
before going into battle. It makes a great noise."

"Do you think they want to fight us?" asked Ned, looking anxiously
at Tom, and then toward where his rifle stood in a corner of the
cabin.

"No, probably that drum was beaten by some of the native priests,"
explained the hunter. "The natives are very superstitious, and
likely they took us for an evil spirit, and wanted to drive us
away."

"Then we'll hustle along out of their sight," said Tom, as he went
to the pilot house to increase the speed of the airship, for he had
been letting it drift along slowly to enable the adventurers to view
the country over which they were passing. A few minutes later, under
the increased force of the machinery, the Black Hawk left the native
village, and the crowd of frightened blacks, far behind.

The travelers passed over a succession of wild stretches of forest
or jungle, high above big grassy plains, over low but rugged
mountain ranges, and big rivers. Now and then they would cross some
lake, on the calm surface of which could be made out natives, in big
canoes, hollowed out from trees. In each case the blacks showed
every appearance of fright at the sight of the airship throbbing
along over their heads.

On passing over the lake, Ned Newton looked down and cried out
excitedly:

"Look! Elephants! They're in swimming, and the natives are shooting
them! Now's our chance, Tom!"

Mr. Anderson and Mr. Durban, after a quick glance, drew back
laughing.

"Those are hippopotami!" exclaimed the old elephant man. "Good
hunting, if you don't care what you shoot, but not much sport in it.
It will be some time yet before we see any elephants, boys."

Ned was rather chagrined at his mistake, but the African travelers
told him that any one, not familiar with the country, would have
made it, especially in looking down from a great height.

They sailed along about half a mile above the earth, Tom gradually
increasing the speed of the ship, as he found the machinery to be
working well. Dinner was served as they were crossing a high grassy
plateau, over which could be seen bounding a number of antelopes.

"Some of those would go good for a meal," said Mr. Durban, after a
pause during which he watched the graceful creatures.

"Then we'll go down and get some for supper," decided Tom, for in
that hot climate it was impossible to carry fresh meat on the
airship.

Accordingly, the Black Hawk was sent down, and came to rest in a
natural clearing on the edge of the jungle. After waiting until the
fierce heat of noonday was over, the travelers got out their rifles
and, under the leadership of Mr. Durban and Mr. Anderson, who was
also an experienced hunter, they set off.

Game was plentiful, but as they could only eat a comparatively small
quantity, and as it would not keep, they only shot what they needed.
Tom had his electric rifle, but hesitated to use it, as Mr. Durban
and Mr. Anderson had each already bowled over a fine buck.

However, a chance came most unexpectedly, for, as they were passing
along the banks of a little stream, which was almost hidden from
view by thick weeds and rank grass, there was a sudden commotion in
the bushes, and a fierce wild buffalo sprang out at the party.

There are few animals in Africa more dreaded by hunters than the
wild buffalo, for the beast, with its spreading sharp horns is a
formidable foe, and will seldom give up the attack until utterly
unable to move. They are fierce and relentless.

"Look out!" yelled Mr. Durban. "To cover, everybody! If that beast
gets after you it's no fun! You and I will fire at him, Mr. Anderson!"

Mr. Durban raised his rifle, and pulled the trigger, but, for some
reason, the weapon failed to go off. Mr. Anderson quickly raised
his, but his foot slipped in a wet place and he fell. At that moment
the buffalo, with a snort of rage, charged straight for the fallen man.

"Tom! your electric rifle!" yelled Ned Newton, but he need not have
done so, for the young inventor was on the alert.

Taking instant aim, and adjusting his weapon for the heaviest
charge, Tom fired at the advancing beast. The result was the same as
in the case of the whale, the buffalo seemed to melt away. And it
was stopped only just in time, too, for it was close to the
prostrate Mr. Anderson, who had sprained his ankle slightly, and
could not readily rise.

It was all over in a few seconds, but it was a tense time while it
lasted.

"You saved my life again, Tom Swift," said Mr. Anderson, as he
limped toward our hero. "Once on Earthquake Island, and again now. I
shan't forget it," and he shook hands with the young inventor.

The others congratulated Tom on his quick shot, and Mr. Damon, as
usual blessed everything in sight, and the electric rifle
especially.

They went back to the airship, taking the fresh meat with them, but
on account of the injury to Mr. Anderson's ankle could not make
quick progress, so that it was almost dusk when they reached the
craft.

"Well, we'll have supper, and then start off," proposed Tom, "I
don't think it would be wise to remain on the ground so near the
jungle."

"No' it's safer in the air," agreed Mr. Durban. The meal was much
enjoyed, especially the fresh meat, and, after it was over, Tom took
his place in the pilot house to start the machinery, and send the
airship aloft.

The motor hummed and throbbed, and the gas hissed into the bag, for
the ground was not level enough to permit of a running start by
means of the planes. Lights gleamed from the Black Hawk and the big
search-lantern in front cast a dazzling finger of light into the
black forest.

"Well, what are you waiting for?" called Ned, who heard the
machinery in motion, but who could not feel the craft rising. "Why
don't you go up, Tom?"

"I'm trying to," answered the young inventor. "Something seems to be
the matter." He pulled the speed lever over a few more notches, and
increased the power of the gas machine. Still the Black Hawk did not
rise.

"Bless my handkerchief box!" cried Mr. Damon, "what's the matter?"

"I don't know," answered Tom. "We seem to be held fast."

He further increased the speed of the propellers, and the gas
machine was set to make vapor at its fullest capacity, and force it
into the bag. Still the craft was held to the earth.

"Maybe the gas has no effect in this climate," called Ned.

"It can't be that," replied Tom. "The gas will operate anywhere. It
worked all right today."

Suddenly she airship moved up a little way, and then seemed to be
pulled down again, hitting the ground with a bump.

"Something is holding us!" cried Tom. "We're anchored to earth! I
must see what it is!" and, catching up his electric rifle, he dashed
out of the cabin.




CHAPTER XII

AMONG THE NATIVES


For a moment after Tom's departure the others stared blankly at one
another. They could hear the throbbing and hum of the machinery, and
feel the thrill of the anchored airship. But they could not
understand what the trouble was.

"We must help Tom!" cried Ned Newton at length as he caught up his
rifle. "Maybe we are in the midst of a herd of elephants, and they
have hold of the ship in their trunks."

"It couldn't be!" declared Mr. Durban, yet they soon discovered that
Ned's guess was nearer the truth then any of them had suspected at
the time.

"We must help him, true enough!" declared Mr. Anderson, and he and
the others followed Ned out on deck.

"Where are you Tom?" called his chum.

"Here." was the answer. "I'm on the forward deck."

"Do you see anything?"

"No, it's too dark. Turn the search-light this way."

"I will," shouted Mr. Damon, and a moment later the gleam of the
powerful lantern brought Tom clearly into view, as he stood on the
small forward observation platform in the bow of the Black Hawk.

An instant later the young inventor let out a startled cry.

"What is it?" demanded Mr. Durban.

"An immense snake!" shouted Tom. "It's wound around a tree, and
partly twined around the ship! That's why we couldn't go up! I'm
going to shoot it."

They looked to where he pointed, and there, in the glare of the
light, could be seen an immense python, fully twenty-five feet long,
the forward part of its fat ugly body circled around the slender
prow of the airship, while the folds of the tail were about a big
tree.

Tom Swift raised his electric rifle, took quick aim, and, having set
it to deliver a moderate charge, pressed the button. The result was
surprising, for the snake being instantly killed the folds uncoiled
and the ship shot upward, only, instead of rising on an even keel,
the bow pointed toward the sky, while the stern was still fast to
the earth. Tilted at an angle of forty-five degrees the Black Hawk
was in a most peculiar position, and those standing on the deck
began to slide along it.

"There's another snake at the stern!" cried Mr. Damon as he grasped
a brace to prevent falling off. "Bless my slippers! it's the mate of
the one you killed! Shoot the other one, Tom!"

The young inventor needed no urging. Making his way as best he could
to the stern of the airship, he killed the second python, which was
even larger than the first, and in an instant the Black Hawk shot
upward, this time level, and as it should be. Things on board were
soon righted, and the travelers could stand upright. High above the
black jungle rose the craft, moving forward under the full power of
the propellers, until Tom rushed into the engine room, and reduced
speed.

"Well, talk about things happening!" exclaimed Ned, when they had
somewhat recovered from the excitement. "I should say they were
beginning with a vengeance!"

"That's the way in Africa," declared Mr. Durban. "It's a curious
country. Those pythons generally go in pairs, but it's the first
time I ever knew them to tackle an airship. They probably stay
around here where there is plenty of small game for them, and very
likely they merely anchored to our craft while waiting for a supper
to come along."

"It was a very odd thing," said Tom. "I couldn't imagine what held
us. After this I'll see that all is clear before I try to go up.
Next time we may be held by a troop of baboons and it strains the
machinery to have it pull against dead weight in that way."

However, it was found no harm had resulted from this experience,
and, after reducing the gas pressure, which was taking them too
high, Tom set the automatic rudders.

"We'll keep on at slow speed through the night," he explained, "and
in the morning we'll be pretty well into the interior. Then we can
lay our course for wherever we want to go. Where had we better head
for?"

"I don't want to interfere with your plans," said Mr. Anderson, "but
I would like to rescue those missionaries. But the trouble is, I
don't know just where to look for them. We couldn't get much of a
line in Majumba on where the country of the red pygmies is located.
What do you think about it, Mr. Durban?"

"As far as elephant hunting goes we can probably do as well in the
pygmy land as anywhere else," answered the veteran, "and perhaps it
will be well to head for that place. If we run across any elephant
herds in the meanwhile, we can stop, get the ivory, and proceed."

They discussed this plan at some length, and agreed that it was the
best thing to do. Mr. Durban had a map of the country around the
center of Africa, and he marked on it, as nearly as he could, the
location of the pygmies' country, while Mr. Anderson also had a
chart, showing the location of the mission which had been wiped out
of existence. It was in the midst of a wild and desolate region.

"We'll do the best we can," declared Tom, "and I think we'll
succeed. We ought to be there in about a week, if we have no bad
luck."

All that night the Black Hawk flew on over Africa, covering mile
after mile, passing over jungle, forest, plains, rivers and lakes,
and, doubtless, over many native villages, though they could not be
seen.

Morning found the travelers above a great, grassy plain, dotted here
and there with negro settlements which were separated by rivers,
lakes or thin patches of forest.

"Well, we'll speed up a bit," decided Tom after breakfast, which was
eaten to the weird accompaniment of hundreds of native warning-drums,
beaten by the superstitious blacks.

Tom went to the engine room, and turned on more speed. He was about
to go back to the pilot house, to set the automatic steering
apparatus to coincide with the course mapped out, when there was a
crash of metal, an ominous snapping and buzzing sound, followed by a
sudden silence.

"What's that?" cried Ned, who was in the motor compartment with his
chum.

"Something's gone wrong!" exclaimed the young inventor, as he sprang
back toward the engine. The propellers had ceased revolving, and as
there was no gas in the bag at that time, it having been decided to
save the vapor for future needs, the Black Hawk began falling toward
the earth.

"We're going down!" yelled Ned.

"Yes, the main motor has broken!" exclaimed Tom. "We'll have to
descend to repair it."

"Say!" yelled Mr. Damon, rushing in, "we're right over a big African
village! Are we going to fall among the natives?"

"It looks that way," admitted Tom grimly, as he hastened to the
pilot house to shift the wings so that the craft could glide easily
to the ground.

"Bless my shoe blacking!" cried the eccentric man as he heard the
beating of drums, and the shouts of the savages.

A little later the airship had settled into the midst of a crowd of
Africans, who swarmed all about the craft.




CHAPTER XIII

ON AN ELEPHANT TRAIL


"Get ready with your guns, everybody!" cried the old elephant
hunter, as he prepared to leave the cabin of the Black Hawk. "Tom
Swift, don't forget your electric rifle. There'll be trouble soon!"

"Bless my cartridge belt!" gasped Mr. Damon. "Why? What will happen?"

"The natives," answered Mr. Durban. "They'll attack us sure as fate!
See, already they're getting out their bows and arrows, and
blowguns! They'll pierce the gas bag in a hundred places!"

"If they do, it will be a bad thing for us," muttered Tom. "We can't
have that happen."

He followed the old elephant hunter outside, and Mr. Anderson, Ned
Newton and Mr. Damon trailed after, each one with a gun, while Tom
had his electric weapon. The airship rested on its wheels on some
level ground, just in front of a large hut, surrounded by a number
of smaller ones. All about were the natives, tall, gaunt black men,
hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with
their kinky hair stuck full of sticks, bones and other odd objects
they presented a curious sight.

 Some of them were dancing about, brandishing their weapons--clubs
spears, bows, and arrows, or the long, slender blowguns, consisting
merely of a hollow reed. Women and children there were, too, also
dancing and leaping about, howling at the tops of their voices.
Above the unearthly din could be heard the noise of the drums and
tom-toms, while, as the adventurers drew up in front of their
airship, there came a sort of chant, and a line of natives, dressed
fantastically in the skins of beasts, came filing out of the large
hut.

"The witch-doctors!" exclaimed Tom, who had read of them in African
travel books.

"Are they going to attack us?" cried Ned.

"Bless my hymn book! I hope not!" came from Mr. Damon. "We wouldn't
have any chance at all in this horde of black men. I wish Eradicate
Sampson and his mule Boomerang were here. Maybe he could talk their
language, and tell them that we meant no harm."

"If there's any talking to be done, I guess our guns will have to do
it," said Tom grimly.

"I can speak a little of their language," remarked Mr. Durban, "but
what in the world are the beggars up to, anyhow? I supposed they'd
send a volley of arrows at us, first shot, but they don't seem to be
going to do that."

"No, they're dancing around us," said Tom.

"That's it!" exclaimed Mr. Anderson. "I have it! Why didn't I think
of it before? The natives are welcoming us!"

"Welcoming us?" repeated Ned.

"Yes," went on the missionary seeker. "They are doing a dance in our
honor, and they have even called out the witch-doctors to do us
homage."

"That's right," agreed Mr. Durban, who was listening to the chanting
of the natives dressed in animal skins. "They take us for spirits
from another land, and are making us welcome here. Listen, I'll see
if I can make out what else they are saying."

The character of the shouts and chants changed abruptly, and the
dancing increased in fervor, even the children throwing themselves
wildly about. The witch-doctors ran around like so many maniacs, and
it looked as much like an American Indian war dance as anything
else.

"I've got it!" shouted Mr. Durban, for he had to call loudly to be
heard above the din. "They are asking us to make it rain. It seems
there has been a dry spell here, and their own rain-makers and
witch-doctors haven't been able to get a drop out of the sky. Now,
they take it that we have come to help them. They think we are going
to bring rain."

"And if we don't, what will happen?" asked Tom.

"Maybe they won't be quite so glad to see us," was the answer.

"Well, if they don't mean war, we might as well put up our weapons,"
suggested Mr. Anderson. "If they're going to be friendly, so much
the better, and if it should happen to rain while we're here, they'd
think we brought it, and we could have almost anything we wanted.
Perhaps they have a store of ivory hidden away, Mr. Durban. Some of
these tribes do."

"It's possible, but the chances for rain are very small. How long
will we have to stay here, Tom Swift?" asked the elephant hunter
anxiously.

"Well, perhaps I can get the motor mended in two or three days,"
answered the young inventor.

"Then we'll have to stay here in the meanwhile," decided Mr. Durban.
"Well, we'll make the best of it. Ha, here comes the native king to
do us honor," and, as he spoke there came toward the airship a
veritable giant of a black man, wearing a leopard skin as a royal
garment, while on his head was a much battered derby hat, probably
purchased at a fabulous price from some trader. The king, if such he
could be called, was accompanied by a number of attendants and
witch-doctors. In front walked a small man, who, as it developed,
was an interpreter. The little cavalcade advanced close to the
airship, and came to a halt. The king made a low bow, either to the
craft or to the elephant hunters drawn up in front of it. His
attendants followed his example, and then the interpreter began to
speak.

Mr. Durban listened intently, made a brief answer to the little man,
and then the elephant hunter's face lighted up.

"It's all right," he said to Tom and the others. "The king takes us
for wonderful spirits from another land. He welcomes us, says we can
have whatever we want, and he begs us to make it rain. I have said
we will do our best, and I have asked that some food be sent us.
That's always the first thing to do. We'll be allowed to stay here
in peace until Tom can mend the ship, and then we'll hit the air
trail again."

The talk between Mr. Durban and the interpreter continued for some
little time longer. Then the king went back to his hut, refusing, as
Mr. Durban said, an invitation to come aboard and see how a modern
airship was constructed. The natives, too, seemed anxious to give
the craft a wide berth.

The excitement had quieted down now, and, in a short time a crowd of
native women came toward the airship, bearing, in baskets on their
heads, food of various kinds. There were bananas, some wild fruits,
yams, big gourds of goats' milk, some boiled and stewed flesh of
young goats, nicely cooked, and other things, the nature of which
could only be guessed at.

"Shall we eat this stuff, or stick to Mr. Damon's cooking?" asked
Tom.

"Oh, you'll find this very good," explained Mr. Durban. "I've eaten
native cookery before. Some of it is excellent and as this appears
to be very good, Mr. Damon can have a vacation while we are here."

The old elephant hunter proved the correctness of his statement by
beginning to eat, and soon all the travelers were partaking of the
food left by the native women. They placed it down on the ground at
a discreet distance from the airship, and hurriedly withdrew. But if
the women and men were afraid, the children were not, and they were
soon swarming about the ship, timidly touching the sides with their
little black fingers, but not venturing on board.

Tom, with Ned and Mr. Damon to help him, began work on the motor
right after dinner. He found the break to be worse than he had
supposed, and knew that it would take at least four days to repair
it.

Meanwhile the airship continued to be a source of wonder to the
natives. They were always about it, save at night, but their
admiration was a respectful one. The king was anxious for the
rain-making incantations to begin, but Mr. Durban put him off.

"I don't want to deceive these simple natives," he said, "and for
our own safety we can't pretend to make rain, and fail. As soon as
we have a chance we'll slip away from here."

But an unexpected happening made a change in their plans. It was on
the afternoon of their third day in the native village, and Tom and
his assistants were working hard at the motor. Suddenly there seemed
to be great excitement in the vicinity of the king's hut. A native
had rushed into the village from the jungle, evidently with some
news, for presently the whole place was in a turmoil.

Once more the king and his attendants filed out toward the airship.
Once more the interpreter talked to Mr. Durban, who listened
eagerly.

"By Jove! here's our chance!" he cried to Tom, when the little man
had finished.

"What is it?" asked the young inventor.

"A runner has just come in with news that a large herd of wild
elephants is headed this way. The king is afraid the big beasts will
trample down all their crops, as often occurs, and he begs us to go
out and drive the animals away. It's just what we want. Come on,
Tom, and all of you. The airship will be safe here, for the natives
think that to meddle with it would mean death or enchantment for
then. We'll get on our first elephant trail!"

The old hunter went into the cabin for his big game gun, while Tom
hastened to get out his electric rifle. Now he would have a chance
to try it on the powerful beasts which he had come to Africa to
hunt.

Amid the excited and joyous shouts of the natives, the hunters filed
out of the village, led by the dusky messenger who had brought the
news of the elephants. And, as Tom and the others advanced, they
could hear a distant trumpeting, and a crashing in the jungle that
told of the near presence of the great animals.




CHAPTER XIV

A STAMPEDE


"Look to your guns, everybody!" cautioned Mr. Durban. "It's no joke
to be caught in an elephant herd with an unloaded rifle. Have you
plenty of ammunition, Mr. Damon?"

"Ammunition? Bless my powder bag, I think I have enough for all the
elephants I'll kill. If I get one of the big beasts I'll be
satisfied. Bless my piano keys! I think I see them, Tom!"

He pointed off through the thick jungle. Surely something was moving
there amid the trees; great slate-colored bodies, massive forms and
waving trunks! The trumpeting increased, and the crashing of the
underbrush sounded louder and nearer.

"There they are!" cried Tom Swift joyously.

"Now for my first big game!" yelled Ned Newton.

"Take it easy," advised Mr. Anderson. "Remember to aim for the spot
I mentioned to you as being the best, just at the base of the skull.
If you can't make a head shot, or through the eye, try for the
heart. But with the big bullets we have, almost any kind of a shot,
near a vital spot, will answer."

"And Tom can fire at their TOES and put them out of business,"
declared Ned, who was eagerly advancing. "How about it, Tom?"

"Well, I guess the electric rifle will come up to expectations. Say,
Mr. Durban, they seem to be heading this way!" excitedly cried Tom,
as the herd of big beasts suddenly turned and changed their course.

"Yes, they are," admitted the old elephant hunter calmly. "But that
won't matter. Take it easy. Kill all you can."

"But we don't want to put too many out of business," said Tom, who
was not needlessly cruel, even in hunting.

"I know that," answered Mr. Durban. "But this is a case of
necessity. I've got to get ivory, and we have to kill quite a few
elephants to accomplish this. Besides the brutes will head for the
village and the natives' grain fields, and trample them down, if
they're not headed back. So all together now, we'll give them a
volley. This is a good place! There they are. All line up now. Get
ready!"

He halted, and the others followed his example. The natives had come
to a stop some time before, and were huddled together in the jungle
back of our friends, waiting to see the result of the white men's
shots.

Tom, Ned, Mr. Damon, and the two older hunters were on an irregular
line in the forest. Before them was the mass of elephants advancing
slowly, and feeding on the tender leaves of trees as they came on.
They would reach up with their long trunks, strip off the foliage,
and stuff it into their mouths. Sometimes, they even pulled up small
trees by the roots for the purpose of stripping them more easily.

"Jove! There are some big tuskers in that bunch!" cried Mr. Durban.
"Aim for the bulls, every one, don't kill the mothers or little
ones." Tom now saw that there were a number of baby Elephants in the
herd, and he appreciated the hunter's desire to spare them and their
mothers.

"Here we go!" exclaimed Mr. Durban, as he saw that Tom and the
others were ready. "Aim! Fire!"

There were thundering reports that awoke the echoes of the jungle,
and the sounds of the rifles were followed by shrill trumpets of
rage. When the smoke blew away three elephants were seen prostrate,
or, rather two, and part of another one. The last was almost blown
to pieces by Tom Swift's electric rifle; for the young inventor had
used a little too heavy charge, and the big beast had been almost
annihilated.

Mr. Durban had dropped his bull with a well-directed shot, and Mr.
Anderson had a smaller one to his credit.

"I guess I missed mine," said Ned ruefully.

"Bless my dress-suit case!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "So did I!"

"One of you hit that fellow!" cried Mr. Durban. "He's wounded."

He pointed to a fair-sized bull who was running wildly about,
uttering shrill cries of anger. The other beasts had gathered in a
compact mass, with the larger bulls, or tuskers, on the outside, to
protect the females and young.

"I'll try a shot at him," said Tom, and raising his electric, gun,
he took quick aim. The elephant dropped in his tracks, for this time
the young inventor had correctly adjusted the power of the wireless
bullet.

"Good!" cried Mr. Durban. "Give them some more! This is some of the
best ivory I've seen yet!"

As he spoke he fired, and bowled over another magnificent specimen.
Ned Newton, determined to make a record of at least one, fired
again, and to his delight, saw a big fellow drop.

"I got him!" he yelled.

Mr. Anderson also got another, and then Mr. Damon, blessing
something which his friends could not make out, fired at one of the
largest bulls in the herd.

"You only nipped him!" exclaimed Mr. Durban when the smoke had
drifted away. "I guess I'll put him out of his misery!"

He raised his weapon and pulled the trigger but no report followed.
He uttered an exclamation of dismay.

"The breech-action has jammed!" he exclaimed. "Drop him, Tom. He's
scented us, and is headed this way. The whole herd will follow in a
minute."

Already the big brute wounded by Mr. Damon had trumpeted out a cry
of rage and defiance. It was echoed by his mates. Then, with
upraised trunk, he darted forward, followed by a score of big
tuskers.

But Tom had heard and understood. The leading beast had not taken
three steps before he dropped under the deadly and certain fire of
the young inventor.

"Bless my wishbone!" cried Mr. Damon when he saw how effective the
electric weapon was.

There was a shout of joy from the natives in the rear. They saw the
slain creatures and knew there would be much fresh meat and feasting
for them for days to come.

Suddenly Mr. Durban cried out: "Fire again, Tom! Fire everybody! The
whole herd is coming this way. If we don't stop them they'll overrun
the fields and village, and may smash the airship! Fire again!"

Almost as he spoke, the rush, which had been stopped momentarily,
when Tom dropped the wounded elephant, began again. With shrill
menacing cries the score of bulls in the lead came on, followed this
time by the females and the young.

"It's a stampede!" yelled Mr. Anderson, firing into the midst of the
herd. Mr. Durban was working frantically at his clogged rifle. Ned
and Mr. Damon both fired, and Tom Swift, adjusting his weapon to
give the heaviest charges, shot a fusillade of wireless bullets into
the center of the advancing elephants, who were now wild with fear
and anger.

"It's a stampede all right!" said Tom, when he saw that the big
creatures were not going to stop, in spite of the deadly fire poured
into them.




CHAPTER XV

LIONS IN THE NIGHT


Shouting, screaming, imploring their deities in general, and the
white men in particular for protection, the band of frightened
natives broke and ran through the jungle, caring little where they
went so long as they escaped the awful terror of the pursuing herd
of maddened elephants. Behind them came Tom Swift and the others,
for it were folly to stop in the path of the infuriated brutes.

"Our only chance is to get on their flank and try to turn them!"
yelled Mr. Durban. "We may beat them in getting to the clearing, for
the trail is narrow. Run, everybody!"

No one needed his excited advice to cause them to hurry. They
scudded along, Mr. Damon's cap falling off in his haste. But he did
not stop to pick it up.

The hunters had one advantage. They were on a narrow but well-cleared
trail through the jungle, which led from the village where they
were encamped, to another, several miles away. This trail was
too small for the elephants, and, indeed, had to be taken in single
file by the travelers.

But it prevented the elephants making the same speed as did our
friends, for the jungle, at this point, consisted of heavy trees,
which halted the progress of even the strongest of the powerful
beasts. True, they could force aside the frail underbrush and the
small trees, but the others impeded their progress.

"We'll get there ahead of them!" cried Tom. "Have you got your rifle
in working order yet, Mr. Durban?"

"No, something has broken, I fear. We'll have to depend on your
electric gun, Tom. Have you many charges left?"

"A dozen or so. But Ned and the others have plenty of ammunition."

"Don't count--on--me!" panted Mr. Damon, who was well-nigh
breathless from the run. "I--can't--aim--straight--any--more!"

"I'll give 'em a few more bullets!" declared Mr. Anderson.

The fleeing natives were now almost lost to sight, for they could
travel through the jungle, ignoring the trail, at high speed. They
were almost like snakes or animals in this respect. Their one
thought was to get to their village, and, if possible, protect their
huts and fields of grain from annihilation by the elephants.

Behind our friends, trumpeting, bellowing and crashing came the
pachyderms. They seemed to be gaining, and Tom, looking back, saw
one big brute emerge upon the trail, and follow that.

"I've got to stop him, or some of the others will do the same,"
thought the young inventor. He halted and fired quickly. The
elephant seemed to melt away, and Tom with regret, saw a pair of
fine tusks broken to bits. "I used too heavy a charge," he murmured,
as he took up the retreat again.

In a few minutes the party of hunters, who were now playing more in
the role of the hunted, came out into the open. They could hear the
natives beating on their big hollow tree drums, and on tom-toms,
while the witch-doctors and medicine men were chanting weird songs
to drive the elephants away.

But the beasts came on. One by one they emerged from the jungle,
until the herd was gathered together again in a compact mass. Then,
under the leadership of some big bulls, they advanced. It seemed as
if they knew what they were doing, and were determined to revenge
themselves by trampling the natives' huts under their ponderous
feet.

But Tom and the others were not idle. Taking a position off to one
side, the young inventor began pouring a fusillade of the electric
bullets into the mass of slate-colored bodies. Mr. Anderson was also
firing, and Ned, who had gotten over some of his excitement, was
also doing execution. Mr. Durban, after vainly trying to get his
rifle to work, cast it aside. "Here! Let me take your gun!" he cried
to Mr. Damon, who, panting from the run, was sitting beneath a tree.

"Bless my cartridge belt! Take it and welcome!" assented the
eccentric man. It still had several shots in the magazine, and these
the old hunter used with good effect.

At first it seemed as if the elephants could not be turned back.
They kept on rushing toward the village, which was not far away, and
Tom and the others followed at one side, as best they could, firing
rapidly. The electric rifle did fearful execution.

Emboldened by the fear that all their possessions would be destroyed
a body of the natives rushed out, right in front of the elephants,
and beat tom-toms and drums, almost under their feet, at the same
time singing wild songs.

"I'm afraid we can't stop them!" muttered Mr. Anderson. "We'd better
hurry to the airship, and protect that, Tom."

But, almost as he spoke, the tide of battle turned. The elephants
suddenly swung about, and began a retreat. They could not stand the
hot fire of the four guns, including Tom's fearful weapon. With wild
trumpetings they fled back into the jungle, leaving a number of
their dead behind.

"A close call," murmured Tom, as he drew a breath of relief. Indeed
this was true, for the tide had turned when the foremost elephants
were not a hundred feet away from the first rows of native huts.

"I should say it was," agreed Ned Newton, wiping his face with his
handkerchief. He, as well as the others, was an odd-looking sight.
They were blackened by powder smoke, scratched by briars, and red
from exertion.

"But we got more ivory in this hour than I could have secured in a
week of ordinary hunting," declared Mr. Durban. "If this keeps up we
won't have to get much more, except that I don't think any of the
tusks to-day are large enough for the special purpose of my
customer."

"The sooner we get enough ivory the quicker we can go to the rescue
of the missionaries," said Mr. Anderson.

"That's so," remarked Tom. "We must not forget the red pygmies."

The natives were now dancing about, wild in delight at the prospect
of unlimited eating, and also thankful for what the white men had
done for them. Alone, the blacks would never have been able to stop
the stampede. They were soon busy cutting up the elephants ready for
a big feast, and runners were sent to tell neighboring tribes, in
adjoining villages, of the delights awaiting them.

Mr. Durban gave instructions about saving the ivory tusks, and the
valuable teeth, each pair worth about $1,000, were soon cut out and
put away for our friends. Some had been lost by the excessive power
of Tom's gun, but this could not be helped. It was necessary to stop
the rush at any price.

There was soon a busy scene at the native village, and with the
arrival of other tribesmen it seemed as if Bedlam had broken loose.
The blacks chattered like so many children as they prepared for the
feast.

"Do white men ever eat elephant meat?" asked Mr. Damon, as the
adventurers were gathered about the airship.

"Indeed they do," declared Mr. Durban. "Baked elephant foot is a
delicacy that few appreciate. I'll have the natives cook some for
us."

He gave the necessary orders, and the travelers had to admit that it
was worth coming far to get.

For the next few days and nights there was great feasting in that
African village, and the praises of the white men, and power of Tom
Swift's electric rifle, were sung loud and long.

Our friends had resumed work on repairing the airship, and the young
inventor declared, one night, that they could proceed the next day.

They were seated around a small campfire, watching the dancing and
antics of some natives who were at their usual work of eating meat.
All about our friends were numerous blazes for the cooking of the
feasts, and some were on the very edge of the jungle.

Suddenly, above the uncouth sounds of the merry-making, there was
heard a deep vibration and roar, not unlike the distant rumble of
thunder or the hum of a great steamer's whistle heard afar in the
fog.

"What's that?" cried Ned.

"Lions," said Mr. Durban briefly. "They have been attracted by the
smell of cooking."

At that moment, and instantly following a very loud roar, there was
an agonized scream of pain and terror. It sounded directly in back
of the airship.

"A lion!" cried Mr. Anderson. "One of the brutes has grabbed a
native!"

Tom Swift caught up his rifle, and darted off toward the dark
jungle.




CHAPTER XVI

SEEKING THE MISSIONARIES


"Here! Come back!" yelled Mr. Damon and Mr. Anderson, in the same
breath, while the old elephant hunter cried out: "Don't you know
you're risking your life, Tom to go off in the dark, to trail a
lion?"

"I can't stand it to let the native be carried off!" Tom shouted
back.

"But you can't see in the dark," objected Mr. Anderson. He had
probably forgotten the peculiar property of the electric rifle. Tom
kept on, and the others slowly followed.

The natives had at once ceased their merrymaking at the roaring of
the lions, and now all were gathered close about the campfires, on
which more wood had been piled, to drive away the fearsome brutes.

"There must be a lot of them," observed Mr. Durban, as menacing
growls and roars came from the jungle, along the edge of which Tom
and the others were walking just then. "There are so many of the
brutes that they are bold, and they must be hungry, too. They came
close to our fire, because it wasn't so bright as the other blazes,
and that native must have wandered off into the forest. Well, I
guess it's all up with him."

"He's screaming yet," observed Ned.

Indeed, above the rumbling roars of the lions, and the crackling of
the campfires, could be heard the moaning cries of the unfortunate
black.

"He's right close here!" suddenly called Tom. "He's skirting the
jungle. I think I can get him!"

"Don't take any risks!" called Mr. Durban, who had caught up his own
rifle, that was now in working order again.

Tom Swift was not in sight. He had now penetrated into the jungle--into
the black forest where stalked the savage lions, intent on
getting other prey. Mr. Durban and Mr. Anderson vainly tried to
pierce the darkness to see something at which to shoot. Ned Newton
had eagerly started to follow his chum, but could not discern where
Tom was. A nameless fear clutched at the lad's heart. Mr. Damon was
softly blessing everything of which he could think.

Once more came that pitiful cry from the native, who was, as they
afterward learned, being dragged along by the lion, who had grabbed
him by the shoulder.

Suddenly in the dense jungle there shone a purple-bluish light. It
illuminated the scene like some great sky-rocket for an instant, and
in that brief time Ned and the others caught sight of a great, tawny
form, bounding along. It was a lion, with head held high, dragging
along a helpless black man.

A second later, and before the intense glare had died away, the
watchers saw the lion gently sink down, as though weary. He stopped
short in his tracks, his head rolled back, the jaws relaxed and the
native, who was unconscious now, toppled to one side.

"Tom's killed him with the electric rifle!" cried Mr. Durban.

"Bless my incandescent lamp! so he has," agreed Mr. Damon. "Bless my
dynamo! but that's a wonderful gun, it's as powerful as a
thunderbolt, or as gentle as a summer shower."

Mr. Durban seeing that the lion was dead, in that brief glance he
had had of the brute, called to some of the natives to come and get
their tribesman. They came, timidly enough at first, carrying many
torches, but when they understood that the lion was dead, they
advanced more boldly. They carried the wounded black to a hut, where
they applied their simple but effective remedies for the cruel bite
in his shoulder.

After Tom had shot several other of the illuminated charges into the
jungle, to see if he could discover any more lions, but failed to do
so, he and his friends returned to the anchored airship, amid the
murmured thanks of the Africans.

Bright fires were kept blazing all the rest of the night, but,
though lions could be heard roaring in the jungle, and though they
approached alarmingly close to the place where our friends were
encamped, none of the savage brutes ventured within the clearing.

With the valuable store of ivory aboard the Black Hawk, which was
now completely repaired, an early start was made the next morning.
The Africans besought Tom and his companions to remain, for it was
not often they could have the services of white men in slaying
elephants and lions.

"But, we've got to get on the trail," decided Tom, when the natives
had brought great stores of food, and such simple presents as they
possessed, to induce the travelers to remain.

"Every hour may add to the danger of the missionaries in the hands
of the red pygmies."

"Yes," said Mr. Anderson gravely, "it is our duty to save them."

And so the airship mounted into the air, our friends waving
farewells to the simple-hearted blacks, who did a sort of farewell
war-dance in their honor, shouting their praises aloud, and beating
the drums and tom-toms, so that the echoes followed for some time
after the Black Hawk had begun to mount upward toward the sky.

The craft was in excellent shape, due to the overhauling Tom had
given it while making the repairs. With the propellers beating the
air, and the rudder set to hold them about two thousand feet high,
the travelers moved rapidly over clearings, forests and jungles.

It was agreed that now, when they had made such a good start in
collecting ivory, that they would spend the next few days in trying
to get on the trail of the red pygmies. It might seem a simple
matter, after knowing the approximate location of the land of these
fierce little natives, to have proceeded directly to it. But Africa
is an immense continent, and even in an airship comparatively little
of the interior can be seen at a time.

Besides, the red pygmies had a habit of moving from place to place,
and they were so small, and so wild, capable of living in very tiny
huts or caves, and so primitive, not building regular villages as
the other Africans do, that as Ned said, they were as hard to locate
as the proverbial flea.

Our friends had a general idea of where to look for them, but on
nearing that land, and making inquiries of several friendly tribes,
they learned that the red pygmies had suddenly disappeared from
their usual haunts.

"I guess they heard that we were after them," said Tom, with a grim
smile one day, as he sent the airship down toward the earth, for
they were over a great plain, and several native villages could be
seen dotted on its surface.

"More likely they are in hiding because they have as captives two
white persons," said Mr. Anderson. "They are fierce and fearless,
but, nevertheless, they have, in times past, felt the vengeance of
the white man, and perhaps they dread that now."

They made a descent, and spent several days making inquiries from
the friendly blacks about the race of little men. But scarcely
anything was learned. Some of the negro tribes admitted having heard
of the red pygmies, and others, with superstitious incantations and
imprecations, said they had never heard of them.

One tribe of very large negroes had heard a rumor to the effect that
the band of the pygmies was several days' journey from their
village, across the mountains, and when Tom sent his airship there,
the searchers only found an impenetrable jungle, filled with lions
and other wild beasts, but not a sign of the pygmies, and with no
elephants to reward their search.

"But we're not going to give up," declared Tom, and the others
agreed with him. Forward went the Black Hawk in the search for the
imprisoned ones, but, as the days passed, and no news was had, it
seemed to grow more and more hopeless.

"I'm afraid if we do find them now," remarked Mr. Anderson at
length, "that we'll only recover the bodies of the missionaries."

"Then we'll avenge them," said Tom quietly.

They had stopped at another native village to make inquiries, but
without result, and were about to start off again that night when a
runner came in to announce that a herd of big elephants was feeding
not many miles away.

"Well, we'll stay over a day or so, and get some more ivory,"
decided Mr. Durban and that night they got ready for what was to
prove a big hunt.




CHAPTER XVII

SHOTS FROM ABOVE


"There they are!"

"My, what a lot of big ones!"

"Jove! Mr. Anderson, see those tusks!"

"Yes, you ought to get what you want this time, Mr. Durban."

"Bless my hatband! There must be two hundred of them!" exclaimed Mr.
Damon.

"I'm glad I recharged my rifle last night!" exclaimed Tom Swift.
"It's fully loaded now."

Then followed exulting cries and shouts of the natives, who were
following our friends, the elephant hunters, who had given voice to
the remarks we have just quoted.

It was early in the morning, and the hunt was about to start, for
the news brought in by the runner the night before had been closely
followed by the brutes themselves, and at dawn our friends were
astir, for scouts brought in word that the elephants, including many
big ones, were passing along only a few miles from the African
village.

Cautiously approaching, with the wind blowing from the elephants to
them, the white hunters made their way along. Mr. Durban was in the
lead, and when he saw a favorable opportunity he motioned for the
others to advance. Then, when he noticed the big bull sentinels of
the herd look about as if to detect the presence of enemies, he gave
another signal and the hunters sank out of sight in the tall grass.

As for the natives, they were like snakes, unseen but ever present,
wriggling along on their hands and knees. They were awaiting the
slaughter, when there would be fresh meat in abundance.

At length the old elephant hunter decided that they were near enough
to chance some shots. As a matter of fact, Tom Swift, with his
electric rifle, had been within range some time before, but as he
did not want to spoil the sport for the others, by firing and
killing, and so alarming the herd, he had held back. Now they could
all shoot together.

"Let her go!" suddenly cried Mr. Durban, and they took aim.

There was a fusillade of reports and several of the big brutes
toppled over.

"Bless my toothbrush!" cried Mr. Damon, "that's the time I got one!"

"Yes, and a fine specimen, too!" added Mr. Durban, who had only
succeeded in downing a small bull, with an indifferent pair of
tusks. "A fine specimen, Mr. Damon, I congratulate you!"

As for Tom Swift, he had killed two of the largest elephants in the
herd.

But now the hunters had their work cut out for them, since the
beasts had taken fright and were charging away at what seemed an
awkward gait, but which, nevertheless, took them rapidly over the
ground.

"Come on!" cried Mr. Durban. "We must get some more. Some of the
finest tusks I have ever seen are running away from us!"

He began to race after the retreating herd, but it is doubtful if he
would have caught up to them had not a band of natives, who had
crept up and surrounded the beasts, turned them by shouts and the
beating of tom-toms. Seeing an enemy in front of them, the elephants
turned, and our friends were able to get in several more shots. Tom
Swift picked out only those with immense tusks, and soon had several
to his credit. Ned Newton also bagged some prizes.

But finally the elephants, driven to madness by the firing and the
yells of the natives, broke through the line of black men, and
charged off into the jungle, where it was not only useless but
dangerous to follow them.

"Well, we have enough," said Mr. Durban, and when the tusks had been
collected it was found that indeed a magnificent and valuable supply
had been gathered.

"But I have yet to get my prize ones," said the old hunter with a
sigh. "Maybe we'll find the elephant with them when we locate the
red pygmies."

"If we do, we'll have our work cut out for us," declared Tom.

As on the other occasion after the hunt, there was a great feast for
the natives, who invited tribes from miles around, and for two days,
while the tusks were being cut out and cleaned, there were barbeques
on every side.

It was one afternoon, when they were seated in the shade of the
airship, cleaning their guns, and discussing the plans they had best
follow next, that our travellers suddenly heard a great commotion
amongst the Africans, who had for the past hour been very quiet,
most of them sleeping after the feasts. They yelled and shouted, and
began to beat their drums.

"Something is coming," said Ned.

"Perhaps there's going to be a fight," suggested Tom.

"Maybe it's the red pygmies," said Mr. Damon. "Bless my--"

But what he was going to bless he did not say, for at that instant
it seemed as if every native in sight suddenly disappeared, almost
like magic. They sank down into the grass, darted into their huts,
or hid in the tall grass.

"What can it be?" cried Tom, as he looked to see that his rifle was
in working order.

"Some enemy," declared Mr. Anderson.

"There they are!" cried Ned Newton, and as he spoke there burst into
view, coming from the tall grass that covered the plain about the
village, a herd of savage, wild buffaloes. On rushed the shaggy
creatures, their long, sharp horns seeming like waving spears as
they advanced.

"Here's more sport!" cried Tom.

"No! Not sport! Danger!" yelled Mr. Durban. "They're headed right
for us!"

"Then we'll stop them," declared the young inventor, as he raised
his gun.

"No! No!" begged the old hunter. "It's as much as our lives are
worth to try to stop a rush of wild buffaloes. You couldn't do it
with Gatling guns. We can kill a few, but the rest won't stop until
they've finished us and the aeroplane too."

"Then what's to be done?" demanded Mr. Anderson.

"Get into the airship!" cried Mr. Durban. "Send her up. It's the
only way to get out of their path. Then we can shoot them from
above, and drive them away!"

Quickly the adventurers leaped into the craft. On thundered the
buffaloes. Tom feared he could not get the motor started quickly
enough. He did not dare risk rising by means of the aeroplane
feature, but at once started the gas machine.

The big bag began to fill. Nearer came the wild creatures,
thundering over the ground, snorting and bellowing with rage.

"Quick, Tom!" yelled Ned, and at that instant the Black Hawk shot
upward, just as the foremost of the buffaloes passed underneath,
vainly endeavoring to gore the craft with their sweeping horns. The
air-travelers had risen just in time.

"Now it's our turn!" shouted Ned, as he began firing from above into
the herd of infuriated animals below him. Tom, after seeing that the
motor was working well, sent the airship circling about, while
standing in the steering tower, he guided his craft here and there,
meanwhile pouring a fusillade of his wireless bullets into the
buffaloes. Many of them dropped in their tracks, but the big herd
continued to rush here and there, crashing into the frail native
huts, tearing them down, and, whenever a black man appeared, chasing
after him infuriatedly.

"Keep at it!" cried Mr. Durban, as he poured more lead into the
buffaloes. "If we don't kill enough of them, and drive the others
away, there won't be anything left of this village."




CHAPTER XVIII

NEWS OF THE RED PYGMIES


Seldom had it been the lot of Tom and his companions to take part in
such a novel hunting scene as that in which they were now
participating. With the airship moving quickly about, darting here
and there under the guidance of the young inventor, the erratic
movements hither and thither of the buffaloes could be followed
exactly. Wherever the mass of the herd went the airship hovered over
them.

"Want any help, Tom?" called Ned, who was firing as fast as his gun
could be worked.

"I guess not," answered the steersman of the Black Hawk, who was
dividing his attention between managing the craft and firing his
electric rifle.

The others, too, were kept busy with their weapons, shooting down on
the infuriated animals. It seemed like a needless slaughter, but it
was not. Had it not been for the white men, the native village,
which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped
out by the animals. As it was they were kept "milling" about in a
circle in an open space, just as stampeded cattle on the western
ranges are kept from getting away, by being forced round and round.

Not a native was in sight, all being hidden away in the jungle or
dense grass. The white hunters in their airship had matters to
themselves.

At last the firing proved even too much for the buffaloes which, as
we have said, are among the most dreaded of African beasts. With
bellows of fear, the leading bulls of the herd unable to find the
enemy above their heads, darted off into the forest the way they had
come.

"There they go!" yelled Mr. Durban.

"Yes, and I'm glad to see the last of them," added Mr. Anderson,
with a breath of relief.

"Score another victory for the electric rifle," exclaimed Ned.

"Oh, you did as much execution as I did," declared the inventor of
the weapon.

"Bless my ramrod!" cried Mr. Damon. "I never shot so much in all my
life before."

"Yes, there is enough food to last the natives for a week," observed
Mr. Durban, as Tom adjusted the deflecting rudder to send the
airship down.

"It won't last much longer at the rate they eat," spoke the young
inventor with a laugh. "I never saw such fellows for appetites! They
seem to eat in their sleep."

There were many dead buffaloes, but there was no fear that the meat,
which was much prized by the Africans, would be wasted. Already the
natives were coming from their hiding places, knowing that the
danger was over. Once more they sang the praises of the mighty white
hunters, and the magical air craft in which they moved about.

With the elephants previously killed, the buffaloes provided
material for a great feast, preparations for which were at once
gotten under way, in spite of the fact that the blacks had hardly
stopped eating since the big hunt began. But it was about all they
had to do.

Some of the buffaloes were very large, and there were a number of
pairs of fine horns. Tom and Ned had some of the blacks cut them off
for trophies, and they were stored in the airship together with the
ivory.

Becoming rather tired of seeing so much feasting, our friends bade
the Africans farewell the next day, and once more resumed their
quest. They navigated through the air for another week, stopping at
several villages, and scanning the jungles and plains by means of
powerful telescopes, for a sight of the red pygmies. They also asked
for news of the sacking of the missionary settlement, but, beyond
meager facts, could learn nothing.

"Well, we've got to keep on, that's all," decided Mr. Durban. "We
may find them most unexpectedly."

"I'm sorry if I have taken you away from your work of gathering
ivory," spoke Mr. Anderson. "Perhaps you had better let me go, and
I'll see if I can't organize a band of friendly blacks, and search
for the red dwarfs myself."

"Not much!" exclaimed Tom warmly. "I said we'd help rescue those
missionaries, and we'll do it, too!"

"Of course," declared the old elephant hunter. "We have quite a lot
of ivory and, while we need more to make it pay well, we can look
for it after we rescue the missionaries as well as before. Perhaps
there will be a lot of elephants in the pygmies' land."

"I was only thinking that we can't go on forever in the airship."
said Mr. Anderson. "You'll have to go back to civilization soon,
won't you, Tom, to get gasolene?"

"No, we have enough for at least a month," answered the young
inventor. "I took aboard an unusually large supply when we started."

"What would happen if we ran out of it in the jungle?" asked Ned.

"Bless my pocketbook! What an unpleasant question!" exclaimed Mr.
Damon. "You are almost as cheerful, Ned, as was my friend Mr.
Parker, the gloomy scientist, who was always predicting dire
happenings."

"Well, I was only wondering," said Ned, who was a little abashed by
the manner in which his inquiry was received.

"Oh, it would be all right," declared Tom. "We would simply become a
balloon, and in time the wind would blow us to some white
settlement. There is plenty of material for making the lifting gas."

This was reassuring, and, somewhat easier in mind, Ned took his
place in the observation tower which looked down on the jungle over
which they were passing.

It was a dense forest. At times there could be seen, in the little
clearings, animals darting along. There were numbers of monkeys, an
occasional herd of buffaloes were observed, sometimes a solitary
stray elephant was noted, and as for birds, there were thousands of
them. It was like living over a circus, Ned declared.

They had descended one day just outside a large native village to
make inquiries about elephants and the red pygmies. Of the big
beasts no signs had been seen in several months, the hunters of the
tribe told Mr. Durban. And concerning the red pygmies, the blacks
seemed indisposed to talk.

Tom and the others could not understand this, until a witch-doctor,
whom the elephant hunter had met some time ago, when he was on a
previous expedition, told him that the tribe had a superstitious
fear of speaking of the little men.

"They may be around us--in the forest or jungle at any minute," the
witch-doctor said. "We never speak of them."

"Say, do you suppose that can be a clew?" asked Tom eagerly. "They
may be nearer at hand than we think."

"It's possible." admitted the hunter. "Suppose we stay here for a
few days, and I'll see if I can't get some of the natives to go off
scouting in the woods, and locate them, or at least put us on the
trail of the red dwarfs."

This was considered good advice, and it was decided to adopt it.
Accordingly the airship was put in a safe place, and our friends
prepared to spend a week, if necessary, in the native village. Their
presence with the wonderful craft was a source of wonder, and by
means of some trinkets judiciously given to the native king, and
also to his head subjects, and to the witch-doctors (who were a
power in the land), the good opinion of the tribe was won. Then, by
promising rewards to some of the bolder hunters, Mr. Durban finally
succeeded in getting them to go off scouting in the jungle for a
clew to the red pygmies.

"Now we'll have to wait," said Mr. Anderson, "and I hope we get good
news."

Our friends spent their time observing some of the curious customs
of the natives, and in witnessing some odd dances gotten up in their
honor. They also went hunting, and got plenty of game, for which
their hosts were duly grateful. Tom did some night stalking and
found his illuminating bullets a great success.

One hot afternoon Tom and Mr. Damon strolled off a little way into
the jungle, Tom with his electric weapon, in case he saw any game.
But no animals save a few big monkeys where to be seen, and the
young inventor scorned to kill them. It seemed too much like firing
at a human being he said, though the natives stated that some of the
baboons and apes were fierce, and would attack one on the slightest
provocation.

"I believe I'll sit down here and rest," said Tom, after a mile's
tramp, as he came to a little clearing in the woods.

"Very well, I'll go on," decided Mr. Damon. "Mr. Durban said there
were sometimes rare orchids in these jungles, and I am very fond of
those odd flowers. I'm going to see if I can get any."

He disappeared behind a fringe of moss-grown trees, and Tom sat
down, with his rifle across his knees. He was thinking of many
things, but chiefly of what yet lay before them--the discovery of
the red dwarfs and the possible rescue of the missionaries.

He might have been thus day-dreaming for perhaps a half hour, when
he suddenly heard great commotion in the jungle, in the direction in
which Mr. Damon had vanished. It sounded as though some one was
running rapidly. Then came the report of the odd man's gun.

"He's seen some game!" exclaimed Tom, jumping up, and preparing to
follow his friend. But he did not have the chance. An instant later
Mr. Damon burst through the bushes with every appearance of fright,
his gun held above his head with one hand, and his pith helmet
swaying to and fro in the other.

"They're coming!" he cried to Tom.

"Who, the red pygmies?"

"No, but a couple of rhinoceroses are after me. I wounded one, and
he and his mate are right behind. Don't let them catch me, Tom!"

Mr. Damon was very much alarmed, and there was good occasion for it,
as Tom saw a moment later, for two fierce rhinoceroses burst out of
the jungle almost on the heels of the fleeing man.

Thought was not quicker than Tom Swift. He raised his deadly rifle,
and pressed the button. A charge of wireless electricity shot toward
the foremost animal, and it was dropped in its tracks. The other
came on woofing and snorting with rage. It was the one Mr. Damon had
slightly wounded.

"Come on!" yelled the young inventor, for his friend was in front of
the beast, and in range with the rifle. "Jump to one side, Mr.
Damon."

Mr. Damon tried, but his foot slipped, and there was no need for
jumping. He fell and rolled over. The rhinoceros swerved toward him,
with the probable intention of goring the prostrate man with the
formidable horn, but it had no chance. Once more the young inventor
fired, this time with a heavier charge, and the animal instantly
toppled over dead.

"Are you hurt?" asked Tom anxiously, as he ran to his friend. Mr.
Damon got up slowly. He felt all over himself, and then answered:

"No, Tom, I guess I'm not hurt, except in my dignity. Never again
will I fire at a sleeping rhinoceros unless you are with me. I had a
narrow escape," and he shook Tom's hand heartily.

"Did you see any orchids?" asked the lad with a smile.

"No, those beasts didn't give me a chance! Bless my tape measure!
but they're big fellows!"

Indeed they were fine specimens, and there was the usual rejoicing
among the natives when they brought in the great bodies, pulling
them to the village with ropes made of vines.

After this Mr. Damon was careful not to go into the jungle alone,
nor, in fact, did any of our friends so venture. Mr. Durban said it
was not safe.

They remained a full week in the native village, and received no
news. In fact, all but one of the hunters came back to report that
there was no sign of the red pygmies in that neighborhood.

"Well, I guess we might as well move on, and see what we can do
ourselves," said Mr. Durban.

"Let's wait until the last hunter comes back," suggested Tom. "He
may bring word."

"Some of his friends think he'll never come back," remarked Mr.
Anderson.

"Why not?" asked Ned.

"They think he has been killed by some wild beast."

But this fear was ungrounded. It was on the second day after the
killing of the rhinoceroses that, as Tom was tinkering away in the
engine-room of the airship, and thinking that perhaps they had
better get under way, that a loud shouting was heard among the
natives.

"I wonder what's up now?" mused the young inventor as he went
outside. He saw Mr. Durban and Mr. Anderson running toward the ship.
Behind them was a throng of blacks, led by a weary man whom Tom
recognized as the missing hunter. The lad's heart beat high with
hope. Did the African bring news?

On came Mr. Durban, waving his hands to Tom.

"We've located 'em!" he shouted.

"Not the red pygmies?" asked Tom eagerly.

"Yes; this hunter has news of them. He has been to the border of
their country, and narrowly escaped capture. Then he was attacked by
a lion, and slightly wounded. But, Tom, now we can get on the
trail!"

"Good!" cried the young inventor. "That's fine news!" and he
rejoiced that once more there would be activity, for he was tired of
remaining in the African camp, and then, too, he wanted to proceed
to the rescue. Already it might be too late to save the unfortunate
missionaries.




CHAPTER XIX

AN APPEAL FOR HELP


The African hunter's story was soon told. He had gone on farther
than had any of his companions, and, being a bold and brave man, had
penetrated into the very fastness of the jungle where few would dare
to venture.

But even he had despaired of getting on the trail of the fierce
little red men, until one afternoon, just at dusk he had heard
voices in the forest. Crouching behind a fallen tree, he waited and
saw passing by some of the pygmy hunters, armed with bows and
arrows, and blowguns. They had been out after game. Cautiously the
hunter followed them, until he located one of their odd villages,
which consisted of little mud huts, poorly made.

The black hunter remained in the vicinity of the pygmies all that
night, and was almost caught, for some wild dogs which hung around
the village smelled him out, and attracted to him the attention of
the dwarf savages. The hunter took to a tree, and so escaped. Then,
carefully marking the trail, he came away in the morning. When near
home, a lion had attacked him, but he speared the beast to death,
after a hand-to-hand struggle in which his leg was torn.

"And do you think we can find the place?" asked Ned, when Mr. Durban
had finished translating the hunter's story.

"I think so," was the reply.

"But is this the settlement where the missionaries are?" asked Tom
anxiously.

"That is what we don't know," said Mr. Anderson. "The native scout
could not learn that. But once we get on the trail of the dwarfs, I
think we can easily find the particular tribe which has the
captives."

"At any rate, we'll get started and do something," declared Tom, and
the next day, after the African hunter had described, as well as he
could, where the place was, the Black Hawk was sent up into the air,
good-bys were called down, and once more the adventurers were under
way.

It was decided that they had better proceed cautiously, and lower
the airship, and anchor it, sometime before getting above the place
where the pygmy village was.

"For they may see us, and, though they don't know what our craft is,
they may take the alarm and hide deeper in the jungle with the
prisoners, where we can't find them," said Tom.

His plan was adopted, and, while it had taken the native hunter
several days to reach the borders of the dwarfs' land, those in the
airship made the trip in one day. That is, they came as far toward
it as they thought would be safe, and one night, having located a
landmark which Mr. Durban said was on the border, the nose of the
Black Hawk was pointed downward, and soon they were encamped in a
little clearing in the midst of the dense jungle which was all about
them.

With his electric rifle, Tom noiselessly killed some birds, very
much like chicken, of which an excellent meal was made and then, as
it became dark very early, and as nothing could be done, they
lighted a campfire, and retired inside their craft to pass the
night.

It must have been about midnight that Tom, who was a light sleeper
at times, was awakened by some noise outside the window near which
his stateroom was. He sat up and listened, putting out his hand to
where his rifle stood in the corner near his bunk. The lad heard
stealthy footsteps pattering about on the deck of the airship. There
was a soft, shuffling sound, such as a lion or a tiger makes, when
walking on bare boards. In spite of himself, Tom felt the hair on
his head beginning to creep, and a shiver ran down his back.

"There's something out there!" he whispered. "I wonder if I'd better
awaken the others? No, if it's a sneaking lion, I can manage to kill
him, but--"

He paused as another suggestion came to him.

The red pygmies! They went barefoot! Perhaps they were swarming
about the ship which they might have discovered in the darkness.

Tom Swift's heart beat rapidly. He got softly out of his bunk, and,
with his rifle in hand made his way to the door opening on deck. On
his way he gently awakened Ned and Mr. Durban, and whispered to them
his fear.

"If the red pygmies are out there we'll need all our force," said
the old elephant hunter. "Call Mr. Damon and Mr. Anderson, Ned, and
tell them to bring their guns."

Soon they were all ready, fully armed. They listened intently. The
airship was all in darkness, for lights drew a horde of insects. The
campfire had died down. The soft footsteps could still be heard
moving about the deck.

"That sounds like only one person or animal," whispered Ned.

"It does," agreed Tom. "Wait a minute, I'll fire an illuminating
charge, and we can see what it is."

The others posted themselves at windows that gave a view of the
deck. Tom poked his electric rifle out of a crack of the door, and
shot forth into the darkness one of the blue illuminations. The deck
of the craft was instantly lighted up brilliantly, and in the glare,
crouched on the deck, could be seen a powerful black man, nearly
naked, gazing at the hunters.

"A black!" gasped Tom, as the light died out. "Maybe it is one from
the village we just left. What do you want? Who are you?" called the
lad, forgetting that the Africans spoke only their own language. To
the surprise of all, there came his reply in broken English:

"Me Tomba! Me go fo' help for Missy Illingway--fo' Massy Illingway.
Me run away from little red men! Me Christian black man. Oh, if you
be English, help Missy Illingway--she most die! Please help. Tomba
go but Tomba be lost! Please help!"




CHAPTER XX

THE FIGHT


Surprise, for the moment, held Tom and the others speechless. To be
answered in English, poor and broken as it was, by a native African,
was strange enough, but when this same African was found aboard the
airship, in the midst of the jungle, at midnight, it almost passed
the bounds of possibility.

"Tomba!" mused Tom, wondering where he had heard that name before.
"Tomba?"

"Of course!" cried Mr. Anderson, suddenly. "Don't you remember?
That's the name of the servant of Mr. and Mrs. Illingway, who
escaped and brought news of their capture by the pygmies. That's who
Tomba is."

"Yes, but Tomba escaped," objected Mr. Durban. "He went to the white
settlements with the news. How comes he here?"

"We'll have to find out," said Tom, simply. "Tomba, are you there?"
he called, as he fired another illuminating charge. It disclosed the
black man standing up on the deck, and looking at them appealingly.

"Yes, Tomba here," was the answer. "Oh, you be English, Tomba know.
Please help Missy and Massy Illingway. Red devils goin' kill 'em
pretty much quick."

"Come in!" called Tom, as he turned on the electric lights in the
airship. "Come in and tell us all about it. But how did you get
here?"

"Maybe there are two Tombas," suggested Ned.

"Bless my safety razor!" cried Mr. Damon "perhaps Ned is right!"

But he wasn't, as they learned when they had questioned the African,
who came inside the airship, looking wonderingly around at the many
strange things he saw. He was the same Tomba who had escaped the
massacre, and had taken news of the capture of his master and
mistress to the white settlement. In vain after that he had tried to
organize a band to go back with him to the rescue, but the whites in
the settlement were too few, and the natives too timid. Then Tomba,
with grief in his heart, and not wanting to live while the
missionaries whom he had come to care for very much, were captives,
he went back into the jungle, determined, if he could not help them,
that at least he would share their fate, and endeavor to be of some
service to them in their captivity.

After almost unbelievable hardships, he had found the red pygmies,
and had allowed himself to be captured by them. They rejoiced
greatly in the possession of the big black man, and for some strange
reason had not killed him. He was allowed to share the captivity of
his master and mistress.

Time went on, and the pygmies did not kill their prisoners. They
even treated them with some kindness but were going to sacrifice
them at their great annual festival, which was soon to take place.
Mr. and Mrs. Illingway, Tomba told our friends in his broken
English, had urged him to escape at the first opportunity. They knew
if he could get away he would travel through the jungle. They could
not, even if they had not been so closely guarded that escape was
out of the question.

But Tomba refused to go until Mr. Illingway had said that perhaps he
might get word to some white hunters, and so send help to the
captives. This Tomba consented to do, and, watching his chance, he
did escape. That was several nights ago, and he had been traveling
through the jungle ever since. It was by mere accident that he came
upon the anchored airship, and his curiosity led him to board her.
The rest is known.

"Well, of all queer yarns, this is the limit!" exclaimed Tom, when
the black had finished. "What had we better do about it?"

"Get ready to attack the red pygmies at once!" decided Mr. Durban.
"If we wait any longer it may be too late!"

"My idea, exactly," declared Mr. Anderson.

"Bless my bowie-knife!" cried Mr. Damon. "I'd like to get a chance
at the red imps! Come on, Tom! Let's start at once."

"No, we need daylight to fight by," replied Tom, with a smile at his
friend's enthusiasm. "We'll go forward in the morning."

"In the airship?" asked Mr. Damon.

"I think so," answered Tom. "There can be no advantage now in trying
to conceal ourselves. We can move upon them from where we are so
quickly that they won't have much chance to get away. Besides it
will take us too long to make our way through the jungle afoot. For,
now that the escape of Tomba must be known, they may kill the
captives at once to forestall any rescue."

"Then we'll move forward in the morning," declared Mr. Durban.

They took Tomba with them in the airship the next day, though he
prayed fervently before he consented to it. But they needed him to
point out the exact location of the pygmies' village, since it was
not the one the hunter-scout had been near.

The Black Hawk sailed through the air. On board eager eyes looked
down for a first sight of the red imps. Tomba, who was at Tom's side
in the steering tower, told him, as best he could, from time to
time, how to set the rudders.

"Pretty soon by-em-by be there," said the black man at length. "Pass
ober dat hill, den red devils live."

"Well, we'll soon be over that hill," announced Tom grimly. "I guess
we'd better get our rifles ready for the battle."

"Are you going to attack them at once?" asked Mr. Damon.

"Well," answered the young inventor, "I don't believe we ought to
kill any of them if we can avoid it. I don't like to do such a thing
but, perhaps we can't help ourselves. My plan is to take the airship
down, close to the hut where the missionaries are confined. Tomba
can point it out to us. If we can rescue them without bloodshed, so
much the better. But we'll fight if we have to."

Grimly they watched as the airship sailed over the hill. Then
suddenly there came into view a collection of mud huts on a vast
plain, surrounded by dense jungle on every side. As the travelers
looked, they could see little creatures running wildly about. Even
without a glass it could be noted that their bodies were covered
with a curious growth of thick sandy hair.

"The red pygmies!" cried Tom. "Now for the rescue!"

Eagerly Tomba indicated the hut where his master and mistress were
held. Telling his friends to have their weapons in readiness, Tom
steered the airship toward the rude shelter whence he hoped to take
the missionaries. Down to the ground swiftly shot the Black Hawk.
Tom checked her with a quick movement of the deflecting rudder, and
she landed gently on the wheels.

"Mr. Illingway! Mrs. Illingway! We have come to rescue you!" yelled
the young inventor, as he stepped out on the deck, with his electric
rifle in his hand. "Where are you? Can you come out?"

The door of the hut was burst open, and a white man and woman,
recognizable as such, even in the rude skins that clothed them,
rushed out. Wonder spread over their faces as they saw the great
airship. They dropped on their knees.

The next instant a swarm of savage little red men surrounded them,
and rudely bore them, strugglingly, back into the hut.

"Come on!" cried Tom, about to leap to the ground. "It's now or
never! We must save them!"

Mr. Durban pulled him back, and pointed to a horde of the red-haired
savages rushing toward the airship. "They'd tear you to pieces in a
minute!" cried the old hunter. "We must fight them from the ship."

There was a curious whistling sound in the air. Mr. Durban looked
up.

"Duck, everybody!" he yelled. "They're firing arrows at us! Get
under shelter, for they may be poisoned!"

Tom and the others darted into the craft. The arrows rattled on deck
in a shower, and hundreds of the red imps were rushing up to give
battle. Inside the hut where the missionaries were, it was now
quiet. Tom Swift wondered if they still lived.

"Give 'em as good as they send!" cried Mr. Durban. "We will have to
fire at them now. Open up with your electric rifle, Tom!"

As he spoke the elephant hunter fired into the midst of the
screaming savages. The battle had begun.




CHAPTER XXI

DRIVEN BACK


What the travelers had heard regarding the fierceness and courage of
the red pygmies had not been one bit exaggerated. Never had such
desperate fighting ever taken place. The red dwarfs, scarcely one of
whom was more than three feet high, were strongly built, and there
were so many of them, and they battled together with such singleness
of purpose, that they were more formidable than a tribe of ordinary-sized
savages would have been.

And their purpose was to utterly annihilate the enemy that had so
unexpectedly come upon them. It did not matter to them that Tom and
the others had arrived in an airship. The strange craft had no
superstitious terror for them, as it had for the simpler blacks.

"Bless my multiplication tables!" cried Mr. Damon. "What a mob of
them!"

"Almost too many!" murmured Tom Swift, who was rapidly firing his
electric rifle at them. "We can never hope to drive them back, I'm
afraid."

Indeed from every side of the plain, and even from the depths of the
jungle the red dwarfs were now pouring. They yelled most horribly,
screaming in rage, brandishing their spears and clubs, and keeping
up an incessant fire of big arrows from their bows, and smaller ones
from the blowguns.

As yet none of our friends had been hit, for they were sheltered in
the airship, and as the windows were covered with a mesh of wire, to
keep out insects, this also served to prevent the arrows from
entering. There were loopholes purposely made to allow the rifles to
be thrust out.

Mercifully, Tom and the others fired only to disable, and not to
kill the red pygmies. Wounded in the arms or legs, the little
savages would be incapable of fighting, and this plan was followed.
But so fierce were they that some, who were wounded twice, still
kept up the attack.

Tom's electric rifle was well adapted for this work, as he could
regulate the charge to merely stun, no matter at what part of the
body it was directed. So he could fire indiscriminantly, whereas the
others had to aim carefully. And Tom's fire was most effective. He
disabled scores of the red imps, but scores of others sprang up to
take their places.

After their first rush the pygmies had fallen back before the
well-directed fire of our friends, but as their chiefs and head men
urged them to the attack again, they came back with still fiercer
energy. Some, more bold than the others, even leaped to the deck of the
airship, and tried to tear the screens from the windows. They partly
succeeded, and in one casement from which Ned was firing they made a
hole.

Into this they shot a flight of arrows, and one slightly wounded the
bank clerk on the arm. The wound was at once treated with
antiseptics, after the window had been barricaded, and Ned declared
that he was ready to renew the fight. Tom, too, got an arrow scratch
on the neck, and one of the barbs entered Mr. Durban's leg, but the
sturdy elephant hunter would not give up, and took his place again
after the wound had been bandaged.

From time to time as he worked his electric gun, which had been
charged to its utmost capacity, Tom glanced at the hut where the
missionaries were prisoners. There was no movement noticed about it,
and no sound came from it. Tom wondered what had happened inside--he
wondered what was happening as the battle progressed.

Fiercely the fight was kept up. Now the red imps would be driven
back, and again they would swarm about the airship, until it seemed
as if they must overwhelm it. Then the fire of the white adventurers
was redoubled. The electric rifle did great work, and Tom did not
have to stop and refill the magazine, as did the others.

Suddenly, above the noise of the conflict, Tom Swift heard an
ominous sound. It was a hissing in the air, and well he knew what it
was.

"The gas bag!" he cried. "They've punctured it! The vapor is
escaping. If they put too many holes in the bag it will be all up
with us!"

"What's to be done?" asked Mr. Durban.

"If we can't drive them back we must retreat ourselves!" declared
Tom desperately. "Our only hope is to keep the airship safe from
harm."

Once more came a rush of the savages. They had discovered that the
gas bag was vulnerable, and were directing their arrows against
that. It was punctured in several more places. The gas was rapidly
escaping.

"We've got to retreat!" yelled Tom. He hurried to the engine-room,
and turned on the power. The great propellers revolved, and sent the
Black Hawk scudding across the level plain. With yells of surprise
the red dwarfs scattered and made way for it.

Up into the air it mounted on the broad wings. For the time being
our friends has been driven back, and the missionaries whom they had
come to rescue were still in the hands of the savages.




CHAPTER XXII

A NIGHT ATTACK


"Well, what's to be done?"

Tom Swift asked that question.

"Bless my percussion cap! They certainly are the very worst imps for
fighting that I ever heard of," commented Mr. Damon helplessly.

"Is the gas bag much punctured?" asked Ned Newton.

"Wait a minute," resumed the young inventor, as he pulled the speed
lever a trifle farther over, thereby sending the craft forward more
swiftly, "I think my question ought to be answered first. What's to
be done? Are we going to run away, and leave that man and woman to
their fate?"

"Of course not!" declared Mr. Durban stoutly, "but we couldn't stay
there, and have them destroy the airship."

"No, that's so," admitted Tom, "if we lost the airship it would be
all up with us and our chances of rescuing the missionaries. But
what can we do? I hate to retreat!"

"But what else is there left for us?" demanded Ned.

"Nothing, of course. But we've got to plan to get the best of those
red pygmies. We can't go back in the airship, and give them open
battle. There are too many of them, and, by Jove! I believe more are
coming every minute!"

Tom and the others looked down. From all sides of the plain,
hastening toward the village of mud huts, from which our friends
were retreating, could be seen swarms of the small but fierce
savages. They were coming from the jungle, and were armed with war
clubs, bows and arrows and the small but formidable blowguns.

"Where are they coming from?" asked Mr. Damon.

"From the surrounding tribes," explained Mr. Durban. "They have been
summoned to do battle against us."

"But how did the ones we fought get word to the others so soon?" Ned
demanded.

"Oh, they have ways of signaling," explained Mr. Anderson. "They can
make the notes of some of their hollow-tree drums carry a long
distance, and then they are very swift runners, and can penetrate
into the jungle along paths that a white man would hardly see. They
also use the smoke column as a signal, as our own American Indians
used to do. Oh, they can summon all their tribesmen to the fight,
and they probably will. Likely the sound of our guns attracted the
imps, though if we all had electric rifles like Tom's they wouldn't
make any noise."

"Well, my rifle didn't appear to do so very much good this time,"
observed the young inventor, as he stopped the forward motion of the
ship now, and let it hover over the plain in sight of the village,
the gas bag serving to sustain the craft, and there was little wind
to cause it to drift. "Those fellows didn't seem to mind being hurt
and killed any more than if mosquitoes were biting them."

"The trouble is we need a whole army, armed with electric rifles to
make a successful attack," said Mr. Durban. "There are swarms of
them there now, and more coming every minute. I do hope Mr. and Mrs.
Illingway are alive yet."

"Yes," added Mr. Anderson solemnly, "we must hope for the best. But,
like Tom Swift, I ask, what's to be done?"

"Bless my thinking cap!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "It seems to me if we
can't fight them openly in the daytime, there's only one other thing
to do."

"What's that?" asked Tom. "Go away? I'll not do it!"

"No, not go away," exclaimed Mr. Damon, "but make a night attack. We
ought to be able to do something then, and with your illuminating
rifle, Tom, we'd have an advantage! What do you say?"

"I say it's the very thing!" declared Tom, with sudden enthusiasm.
"We'll attack them to-night, when they're off their guard, and we'll
see if we can't get the missionaries out of that hut. And to better
fool the savages, we'll just disappear now, and make 'em believe
we've flown away."

"Then the missionaries will think we're deserting them," objected
Mr. Anderson.

But there was no help for it, and so Tom once more turned on the
power and the craft sailed away.

Tomba, the faithful black, begged to be allowed to go down, and tell
his master and mistress that help would soon be at hand again, even
though it looked like a retreat on the part of the rescuers, but
this could not be permitted.

"They'd tear you in pieces as soon as you got among those red imps,"
said Tom. "You stay here, Tomba, and you can help us to-night."

"A'right, me glad help lick red fellows," said the black, with as
cheerful a grin as he could summon.

The Black Hawk circled around, with Tom and the others looking for a
good place to land. They were out of sight of the village now but
did not doubt but that they were observed by the keen eyes of the
little men.

"We want to pick out a place where they won't come upon us as we
descend," declared Tom. "We've got to mend some leaks in the gas
bag, for, while they are not serious, if we get any more punctures
they may become so. So we've got to pick out a good place to go
down."

Finally, by means of powerful glasses, a desolate part of the jungle
was selected. No files of the red dwarfs, coming from their
scattered villages to join their tribesmen, had been noted in the
vicinity picked out, and it was hoped that it would answer. Slowly
the airship settled to earth, coming to rest in a thick grove of
trees, where there was an opening just large enough to allow the
Black Hawk to enter.

Our friends were soon busy repairing the leaks in the bag, while Mr.
Damon got a meal ready. As they ate they talked over plans for the
night attack.

It was decided to wait until it was about two o'clock in the
morning, as at that hour the dwarfs were most generally asleep,
Tomba said. They always stayed up quite late, sitting around camp-fires,
and eating the meat which the hunters brought in each day. But their
carousings generally ended at midnight, the black said, and then they
fell into a heavy sleep. They did not post guards, but since they knew
of the presence of the white men in the airship, they might do it
this time.

"Well, we've got to take our chance," decided Tom. "We'll start off
from here about one o'clock, and I'll send the ship slowly along.
We'll get right over the hut where the captives are, if possible,
and then descend. I'll manage the ship, and one of you can work the
electric rifle if they attack us. We'll make a dash, get Mr. and
Mrs. Illingway from the hut, and make a quick get-away."

It sounded good, and they were impatient to put it into operation.
That afternoon Tom and his friends went carefully over every inch of
their craft, to repair it and have it in perfect working order. Guns
were cleaned, and plenty of ammunition laid out. Then, shortly after
one o'clock in the morning the ship was sent up, and with the
searchlight ready to be turned on instantly, and with his electric
rifle near at hand, Tom Swift guided his craft on to the attack.
Soon they could see the glow of dying fires in the dwarfs' village,
but no sound came from the sleeping hordes of red imps.




CHAPTER XXIII

THE RESCUE


"Can you make out the hut, Tom?" asked Ned, as he stood at his
chum's side in the steering tower, and gazed downward on the silent
village.

"Not very clearly. Suppose you take a look through the night-glasses.
Maybe you'll have better luck."

Ned peered long and earnestly.

"No, I can't see a thing." he said. "It all looks to be a confused
jumble of huts. I can't tell one from the other. We'll have to go
lower."

"I don't want to do that," objected Tom. "If this attack succeeds at
all, it will have to be sharp and quick. If we go down where they
can spot us, and work our way up to the hut where the captives are,
we'll run the chance of an attack that may put us out of business."

"Yes, we ought to get right over the hut, and then make a sudden
swoop down," admitted Ned, "but if we can't see it--"

"I have it!" cried Tom suddenly. "Tomba! That African can see in the
dark like a cat. Why, just before we started I dropped a wrench, and
I didn't have any matches handy to look for it. I was groping around
in the dark trying to get my hands on it, and you know it was pretty
black in the jungle. Well, along come Tomba. And he spotted it at
once and picked it up. We'll call him here and get him to point out
the hut. He can tell me how to steer."

"Good!" cried Ned, and the black was soon standing in the pilot
house. He comprehended what was wanted of him, and peered down,
seeking to penetrate the darkness.

"Shall I go down a little lower?" asked Tom.

For a moment Tomba did not answer. Then he uttered an exclamation of
pleasure.

"Me see hut!" he said, clutching Tom's arm. "Down dere!" He pointed,
but neither Tom nor Ned could see it. However, as Tomba was now
giving directions, telling Tom when to go to the left or the right,
as the wind currents deflected they were certain of soon reaching
the place where Mr. and Mrs. Illingway were concealed, if they were
still alive.

The Black Hawk was moving slowly, and was not under as good control
as if she had been making ninety miles an hour. As it was desired to
proceed as quietly as possible, the craft was being used as a
dirigible balloon, and the propellers were whirled around by means
of a small motor, worked by a storage battery. While not much power
was obtained this way, there was the advantage of silence, which was
very necessary. Slowly the Black Hawk sailed on through the night.
In silence the adventurers waited for the moment of action. They had
their weapons in readiness. Mr. Durban was to work the electric
rifle, as all Tom's attention would be needed at the machinery. As
soon as the craft had made a landing he was to leap out, carrying a
revolver in either hand, and, followed by Tomba, would endeavor to
gain entrance to the hut, break through the flimsy grass-woven
curtain over the doorway, and get Mr. and Mrs. Illingway out. Ned,
Mr. Damon and the other two men would stand by to fire on the red
pygmies as soon as they commenced the attack, which they would
undoubtedly do as soon as the guards of the captives raised the
alarm.

The airship was in darkness, for it would have been dangerous to
show a light. Some wakeful dwarf might see the moving illumination
in the sky, and raise a cry.

"Mos' dere," announced Tomba at length. And then, for the first
time, Ned and Tom had a glimpse of the hut. It stood away from the
others, and was easy to pick out in daylight, but even the darkness
offered no handicap to Tomba. "Right over him now," he suddenly
called, as he leaned out of the pilot house window, and looked down.
"Right over place. Oh, Tomba glad when he see Missy an' Massy!"

"Yes, I hope you do see them," murmured Tom, as he pulled the lever
which would pump the gas from the inflated bag, and compress it into
tanks, until it was needed again to make the ship rise. Slowly the
Black Hawk sank down.

"Get ready!" called Tom in a low voice.

It was a tense moment. Every one of the adventurers felt it, and all
but Tom grasped their weapons with tighter grips. They were ready to
spring out as soon as a landing was made. Tom managed the machinery
in the dark, for he knew every wheel, gear and lever, and could have
put his hand on any one with his eyes shut. The two loaded revolvers
were on a shelf in front of him. The side door of the pilot house
was ajar, to allow him quick egress.

Tomba, armed with a big club he had picked up in the jungle, was
ready to follow. The black was eager for the fray to begin, though
how he and the others would fare amid the savages was hard to say.

Still not a sound broke the quiet. It was very dark, for nearly all
the camp fires, over which the nightly feast had been prepared, were
out. The hut could be dimly made out, however.

Suddenly there was a slight tremor through the ship. She seemed to
shiver, and bound upward a little.

"We've landed!" whispered Tom. "Now for it! Come on, Tomba!"

The big black glided after the lad like a shadow. With his two
weapons held in readiness our hero went out on deck. The others,
with cocked rifles, stood ready for the attack to open. It had been
decided that as soon as the first alarm was given by the dwarfs,
which would probably be when Tom broke into the hut, the firing
would begin.

"Open!" called Tom to Tomba, and the big black dashed his club
through the grass curtain over the doorway of the hut. He fairly
leaped inside, with a cry of battle on his lips.

"Mr. Illingway! Mrs. Illingway!" called Tom, "We've come to save
you. Hurry out. The airship is just outside!"

He fired one shot through the roof of the hut, so that the flash
would reveal to him whether or not the two missionaries were in the
place. He saw two forms rise up in front of him, and knew that they
were the white captives he had observed daring the former attack.

"Oh, what is it?" he heard the woman ask.

"A rescue! Thank the dear Lord!" answered her husband fervently.
"Oh, whoever you are, God bless you!"

"Come quickly!" cried Tom, "we haven't a moment to lose!"

He was speaking to absolute blackness now, for it was darker
immediately following the revolver flash than before. But he felt a
man's hand thrust about his arm, and he knew it was Mr. Illingway.

"Take your wife's hand, and follow me," ordered Tom. "Come, Tomba!
Are there any of the red pygmies in here?"

He had not seen any at the weapon's flash, but his question was
answered a moment later, for there arose from within and without the
hut a chorus of wild yells. At the same time Tom felt small arms
grasp him about the legs.

"Come on!" he yelled. "They're awake and after us!"

The din outside increased. Tom heard the rifles of his friends
crack. He saw, through the torn door curtain, the flashes of fire.
Then came a blue glare, and Tom knew that Mr. Durban was using the
electric weapon.

By these intermittent gleams Tom managed to see sufficiently to
thrust Mr. and Mrs. Illingway ahead of him. Tomba was at their side.
The yells inside the hut were almost deafening. All the red dwarfs
left to guard the captives had awakened, and they could see well
enough to attack Tom. Fortunately they had no weapons, but they
fairly threw themselves upon the sturdy lad, trying to pull him
down.

"Go on! Go on!" he yelled to the captives, fairly pushing them
along. Then, knowing they were out of the way, he turned and fired
his two revolvers as fast as he could pull the triggers, into the
very faces of the red imps who were seeking to drag him down. Again
and again he fired, until he had emptied both cylinders of his
weapons.

He felt the grasps of the fiendish little men relax one by one. Tom
finally dragged himself loose, and staggered out of the hut. The
captives and Tomba were right in front of him. At the airship, which
loomed up in the flashes from the guns and electric rifle, Tom's
friends were giving battle. About them swarmed the hordes of
savages, with more of the imps pouring in every moment.

"Get aboard!" cried Tom to the missionaries. "Get on the airship,
and we'll move out of this!"

He felt a stinging pain in his neck, where an arrow struck him. He
tore the arrow out, and rushed forward. Fairly pushing Mr. and Mrs.
Illingway up on deck before him, Tom followed. Tomba was capering
about his master and mistress, and he swung his big club savagely.
He had not been idle, and many a red imp had gone down under his
blows.

"Rescued! Rescued!" murmured Mr. Illingway, as Tom hastened to the
pilot house to start the motor.




CHAPTER XXIV

TWO OTHER CAPTIVES


But the rescue was not yet accomplished. Those on the airship were
still in danger, and grave peril, for all about them were the red
savages, shouting, howling, yelling and capering about, as they were
now thoroughly aroused, and realized that their captives had been
taken away from them. They determined to get them back, and were
rallying desperately to battle. Nearly all of them were armed by
this time, and flight after flight of spears and arrows were thrown
or shot toward the airship.

Fortunately it was too dark to enable the pygmies to take good aim.
They were guided, to an extent, by the flashes of fire from the
rifles, but these were only momentary. Still some of our friends
received slight wounds, for they stood on the open deck of the
craft.

"Bless my eye-glasses!" suddenly exclaimed Mr. Damon. "I'm stuck!"

"Don't mind that!" advised Ned. "Keep on pouring lead into them.
We'll soon be away from here!"

"Don't fire any more!" called Mr. Durban. "The gun-flashes tell them
where to shoot. I'll use the electric rifle. It's better."

They followed his advice, and put aside their weapons. By means of
the electric flash, which he projected into the midst of the
savages, without the glare coming on the airship, Mr. Durban was
able to tell where to aim. Once he had a mass of red pygmies
located, he could keep on shooting charge after charge into their
midst.

"Use it full power!" called Tom, as he opened the gas machine to its
widest capacity, so the bag would quickly fill, and the craft be
sent forward, for it was so dark, and the ground near the huts so
uneven, that the Black Hawk could not rise as an aeroplane.

The elephant hunter turned on full strength in the electric gun and
the wireless bullets were sent into the midst of the attackers. The
result was surprising. They were so closely packed together that
when one was hit the electrical shock was sent through his nearly
naked body into the naked bodies of his tribesmen who pressed on
every side of him. In consequence whole rows of the savages went
down at a time, disabled from fighting any more.

Meanwhile Tom was working frantically to hasten the rising of the
airship. His neck pained him very much where the arrow had struck
him, but he dared not stop now to dress the wound. He could feel the
blood running down his side, but he shut his teeth grimly and said
nothing.

The two missionaries, scarcely able to believe that they were to be
saved, had been shown into an inner cabin by Tomba, who had become
somewhat used to the airship by this time, and who could find his
way about well in the dark, for no lights had yet been turned on.

Hundreds of pygmies had been disabled, yet still others came to take
their places. The gas bag was again punctured in several places, but
the rents were small, and Tom knew that he could make the gas faster
than it could escape, unless the bag was ripped open.

"They're climbing up the sides!" suddenly called Ned Newton, for he
saw several of the little men clambering up. "What shall we do?"

"Pound their fingers!" called Mr. Anderson. "Get clubs and whack
them!" It was good advice. Ned remembered on one occasion when he
and Tom were looking at Andy Foger's airship, how this method had
been proposed when the bank clerk hung on the back fence. As he
grabbed up a stick, and proceeded to pound the hands and bare arms
of the savages who were clinging to the railing, Ned found himself
wondering what had become of the bully. He was to see Andy sooner
than he expected.

Suddenly in the midst of the fighting, which was now a hand-to-hand
conflict, there was a tremor throughout the length of the airship.

"She's going up!" yelled Ned.

"Bless my check-book!" cried Mr. Damon, "if we don't look out some
of these red imps will go up with us, too!"

As he spoke he whacked vigorously at the hands of several of the
pygmies, who dropped off with howls of anguish.

The craft quickly shot upward. There were yells of terror from a few
of the red savages who remained clinging to different parts of the
Black Hawk and then, fearing they might be taken to the clouds,
they, too, dropped off. The rescuers and rescued mounted higher and
higher, and, when they were far enough up so that there was no
danger from the spears or arrows, Tom switched on the lights, and
turned the electric current into the search-lantern, the rays of
which beamed down on the mass of yelling and baffled savages below.

"A few shots for them to remember us by!" cried Mr. Durban, as he
sent more of the paralyzing electric currents into the red imps.
Their yell of rage had now turned to shouts of terror, for the
gleaming beam of light frightened them more than did the airship, or
the bullets of the white men. The red pygmies fled to their huts.

"I guess we gave them a lesson," remarked Tom, as he started the
propellers and sent the ship on through the night.

"Why, Tom! You're hurt!" cried Ned, who came into the pilot house at
that moment, and saw blood on his chum.

"Only a scratch," the young inventor declared.

"It's more than that," said Mr. Durban who looked at it a little
later. "It must be bound up, Tom."

And, while Ned steered the ship back to the jungle clearing whence
they had come to make the night attack, Tom's wound was dressed.

Meanwhile the two missionaries had been well taken care of. They
were given other garments, even some dresses being provided for Mrs.
Illingway, for when the voyage was begun Tom had considered the
possibility of having a woman on board, and had bought some ladies'
garments. Then, having cast down to earth the ill-smelling skins
which formed their clothes while captives, Mr. and Mrs. Illingway,
decently dressed, thanked Tom and the others over and over again.

"We had almost given up hope," said the lady, "when we saw them
drive you back after the first attack. Oh, it is wonderful to think
how you saved us, and in an airship!" and she and her husband began
their thanks over again.

A good meal was prepared by Mr. Damon, for the rescuers and rescued
ones were hungry, and since they had been held prisoners the two
missionaries had not been given very good food.

"Oh, it hardly seems possible that we are eating with white men
again," said Mr. Illingway, as he took a second cup of coffee,
"hardly possible!"

"And to see electric lights, instead of a camp-fire," added his
wife. "What a wonderful airship you have, Tom Swift."

"Yes, it's pretty good," he admitted. "It came in useful to-night,
all right."

They were now far enough from the savages, and the pygmies' fires,
which had been set aglow anew when the attack began, could no longer
be observed.

"We'll land at the place where we camped before," said Tom, who had
again assumed charge of the ship, "and in the morning we'll start
for civilization."

"No can get two other white men?" suddenly asked Tomba, who had been
sitting, gazing at his recovered master and mistress. "Fly-ship go
back, an' leave two white mans here?" the black asked.

"What in the world does he mean?" demanded Tom. "Of course we're not
going to leave any of our party behind!"

"Let me question him," suggested Mr. Illingway, and he began to talk
to the African in his own tongue. A rapid conversation followed, and
a look of amazement spread over the faces of the two missionaries,
as they listened.

"What is it?" asked Mr. Durban. "What does Tomba say?"

"Why the pygmies have two other white men in captivity," said Mr.
Illingway. "They were brought in yesterday, after you were driven
away. Two white men, or, rather a white man and a youth, according
to Tomba. They are held in one of the huts near where we were, but
tied so they couldn't escape in the confusion."

"How does Tomba know this?" asked Mr. Damon.

"He says," translated Mr. Illingway, after more questioning of the
black, "that he heard the red pygmies boasting of it after we had
escaped. Tomba says he heard them say that, though we were gone, and
could not be killed, or sacrificed, the other two captives would
meet that horrible fate."

"Two other white captives in the hands of the red imps!" murmured
Tom. "We must rescue them!"

"You're not going to turn back now, are you?" asked Mr. Durban.

"No, but I will as soon as I look the ship over. We'll come back
to-morrow. And we'll have to make a day attack or it will be too late
to save them. Two other white captives! I wonder who they can be."

There was a big surprise in store for Tom Swift.




CHAPTER XXV

THE ROGUE ELEPHANT--CONCLUSION


Early the next day the airship was again afloat. The night, what
little of darkness remained after the rescue, had been spent in the
clearing in the dense jungle. Some slight repairs had been made to
the craft, and it was once more in readiness to be used in battle
against the relentless savages.

"We can't wait for darkness," declared Tom. "In the first place
there isn't time, and again, we don't know in what part of the
village the other captives are. We'll have to hunt around."

"And that means going right down into the midst of the imps and
fighting them hand to hand," said Ned.

"That's what it means," assented Tom grimly, "but I guess the powder
bombs will help some."

Before starting they had prepared a number of improvised bombs,
filled with powder, which could be set off by percussion. It was the
plan to drop these down from the airship, into the midst of the
savages. When the bomb struck the ground, or even on the bodies of
the red dwarfs, it would explode. It was hoped that these would so
dismay the little men that they would desert the village, and leave
the way clear for a search to be made for the other captives.

On rushed the Black Hawk. There was to be no concealment this time,
and Tom did not care how much noise the motors made. Accordingly he
turned on full speed.

It was not long before the big plain was again sighted. Everything
was in readiness, and the bombs were at hand to be dropped
overboard. Tom counted on the natives gathering together in great
masses as soon as they sighted the airship, and this would give him
the opportunity wanted.

But something different transpired. No sooner was the craft above
the village, than from all the huts came pouring out the little red
men. But they did not gather together--at least just then. They ran
about excitedly, and it could be seen that they were bringing from
the huts the rude household utensils in which they did their
primitive cooking. The women had their babies, and some, not so
encumbered, carried rolls of grass matting. The men had all their
weapons.

"Bless my wagon wheel!" cried Mr. Damon. "What's going on?"

"It looks like moving day," suggested Ned Newton.

"That's just what it is!" declared Mr. Durban. "They are going to
migrate. Evidently they have had enough of us, and they're going to
get out of the neighborhood before we get a chance to do any more
damage. They're moving, but where are the white captives?"

He was answered a moment later, for a crowd of the dwarfs rushing to
a certain hut, came out leading two persons by means of bark ropes
tied about their necks. It was too far off to enable Tom or the
others to recognize them, but they could tell by the clothing that
they were white captives.

"We've got to save them!" exclaimed the young inventor.

"How?" asked Mr. Damon. And, indeed, it did seem a puzzle for, even
as Tom looked, the whole tribe of red imps took up the march into
the jungle, dragging the white persons with them. The captives
looked up, saw the airship, and made frantic motions for help. It
was too far off, yet, to hear their voices. But the distance was
lessening every moment, for Tom had speeded the motor to the highest
pitch.

"What are you going to do?" demanded Ned.

"I'll show you," answered his chum. "Take some of those bombs, and
be ready to drop them overboard when I give the word."

"But we may kill those white people," objected Ned.

"Not the way I'm going to work it. You drop them when I give the
word."

Tom steered the airship toward the head of the throng of blacks. The
captives were in the rear, and the van of the strange procession was
near the edge of the jungle now. Once the red dwarfs got into the
tangle of underbrush they could never be found, and their captives
would die a miserable death.

"We've got to stop them," murmured Tom. "Are you ready, Ned?"

"Ready!"

"Then drop the bombs!"

Ned dropped them. A sharp explosion was heard, and the head of the
procession was blown apart and thrown into confusion. The throng
halted.

"Drop more!" cried Tom, sending the ship about in a circle, and
hovering it over the middle of the press of savages.

More of the deadly bombs exploded. The pygmies were running about
wildly. Tom, who was closely watching the rear of the cavalcade,
suddenly called out:

"Now's our chance! They've let their captives go, and are running
into the jungle. We must swoop down, and get the prisoners!"

It was no sooner said than the nose of the Black Hawk was pointed
downward. Onward it flew, the two captives wildly waving their hands
to the rescuers. There was no more danger from the red savages. They
had been thrown into panic and confusion, and were rapidly
disappearing into the forest. The terrible weapons of the whites had
been too much for them.

"Quick! Get on board!" called Tom, as he brought the machinery to a
stop. The airship now rested on the ground, close to the former
captives. "Get in here!" shouted the young inventor. "They may
change their minds and come back."

The two white persons ran toward the Black Hawk. Then one of them--the
smaller--halted and cried out:

"Why, it's Tom Swift!"

Tom turned and glanced at the speaker. A look of astonishment spread
over his face.

"Andy Foger--here!" gasped Tom. "How in the world--?"

"I dink besser as ve git on der board, und dalk aftervard!"
exclaimed Andy's companion, who spoke with a strong German accent.
"I like not dose red little mans."

In another minute the two rescued ones were safe on Tom Swift's
airship, and it had arisen high enough to be out of all danger.

"How in the world did you ever get here?" asked Tom of the lad who
had so often been his enemy.

"I'll tell you soon," spoke Andy, "but first, Tom, I want to ask
your forgiveness for all I've done to you, and to thank you, from
the bottom of my heart, for saving us. I thought we were going to be
killed by those dwarfs; didn't you, Herr Landbacher?"

"Sure I did. But ve are all right now. Dis machine is efen besser as
mine vot vos lost. Is dere anyt'ing to eats, on board, if you vill
excuse me for being so bolt as to ask?"

"Plenty to eat," said Tom, laughing, "and while you eat you can tell
us your story. And as for you, Andy, I hope we'll be friends from
now on," and Tom held out his hand.

There was not much to tell that the reader has not already guessed.
Andy and the German, as has been explained, went abroad to give
airship flights. They were in the lower part of Egypt, and a sudden
gale drove them into Africa.

For a long time they sailed on, and then their fuel gave out, and
they had to descend into the jungle. They managed to fall in with
some friendly blacks, who treated them well. The airship was useless
without gasolene, and it was abandoned.

Andy and the German inventor were planning to walk to some white
settlement, when the tribe they were with was attacked by the red
dwarfs and vanquished. Andy and his friend were taken prisoners, and
carried to the very village where the missionaries were, just before
the latter's rescue.

Then came the fight, and the saving of Andy and the German, almost
at the last minute.

"Well, you certainly had nearly as many adventures as we did," said
Tom. "But I guess they're over now."

But they were not. For several days the airship sailed on over the
jungles without making a descent. Mr. and Mrs. Illingway wished to
be landed at a white settlement where they had other missionary
friends. Tom would go with them. This was done, and Tom and the
others spent some time in this place, receiving so many kinds of
thanks that they had to protest.

Andy and Herr Landbacher asked to be taken back to the coast, where
they could get a steamer to America. Andy was a very different lad
now, and not the bully of old.

"Well, hadn't we better be thinking of getting back home?" asked Tom
one day.

"Not until we get some more ivory," declared Mr. Durban. "I think
we'll have to have another elephant hunt."

They did, about a week later, and got some magnificent tusks. Tom's
electric rifle did great work, to the wonder of Andy and Mr.
Landbacher, who had never before seen such a curious weapon. They
also did some night hunting.

"But we haven't got that pair of extra large tusks that I want,"
said the old hunter, as he looked at the store of ivory accumulated
after the last hunt. "I want those, and then I'll be satisfied.
There is one section of the country that we have not touched as yet,
and I'd like to visit that."

"Then let's go," proposed Tom, so, good-bys having been said to the
missionaries, who sent greetings to their friends in America, and to
the church people who had arranged for their rescue, the airship was
once more sent to the deepest part of a certain jungle, where Mr.
Durban hoped to get what he wanted.

They had another big hunt, but none of the elephants had any
remarkable tusks, and the hunter was about to give up in despair,
and call the expedition over, when one afternoon, as they were
sailing along high enough to merely clear the tops of the trees, Tom
heard a great crashing down below.

"There's something there," he called to Mr. Durban. "Perhaps a small
herd of elephants. Shall we go down?"

Before Mr. Durban could answer there came into view, in a small
clearing, an elephant of such size, and with such an enormous pair
of tusks, that the young inventor and the old hunter could not
repress cries of astonishment.

"There's your beast!" said Tom. "I'll go down and you can pot him,"
and, as he spoke, Tom stopped the propellers, so that the ship hung
motionless in the air above where the gigantic brute was.

Suddenly, as though possessed by a fit of rage, the elephant rushed
at a good-sized tree and began butting it with his head. Then,
winding his trunk around it he pulled it up by the roots, and began
trampling on it out of a paroxysm of anger.

"A rogue elephant!" exclaimed Mr. Durban. "Don't go down if you
value your life, or the safety of the airship. If we attacked that
brute on the ground, we would be the hunted instead of the hunters.
That's a rogue elephant of the worst kind, and he's at the height of
his rage."

This was indeed so, for the beast was tearing about the clearing
like mad, breaking off trees, and uprooting them in sheer
wantonness. Tom knew what a "rogue" elephant was. It is a beast that
goes away from the herd, and lives solitary and alone, attacking
every living thing that comes in his way. It is a species of
madness, a disease which attacks elephants and sometimes passes
away. More often the afflicted creature gives battle to everything
and every animal he meets until he is killed or carried off by his
malady. It was such an elephant that Tom now saw, and he realized
what the hunter said about attacking one, as he saw the brute's mad
rushes.

"Well, if it's dangerous to attack him on the ground, we'll kill him
from up above," said the young inventor. "Here is the electric
rifle, Mr. Durban. I'll let you have the honor of getting those
tusks. My! But they're whoppers! Better use almost a full charge.
Don't take any chances on merely wounding him, and having him rush
off to the jungle."

"I won't," said the old hunter, and he adjusted the electric rifle
which Tom handed him.

As the great beast was tearing around, trumpeting shrilly and
breaking off trees Mr. Durban fired. The creature sank down,
instantly killed, and was out of his misery, for often it is great
pain which makes an otherwise peaceable elephant become a "rogue."

"He's done for," said Ned. "I guess you have the tusks you want now,
Mr. Durban."

"I think so," agreed the hunter, and when the airship was sent down,
and the ivory cut out, it was found that the tusks were even larger
than they had supposed. "It is a prize worth having," said Mr.
Durban. "I'm sure my customer will think so, too. Now I'm ready to
head for the coast."

Tom Swift went to the engine room, while the last big tusks were
being stored away with the other ivory. Several parts of the motor
needed oiling, and Ned was assisting in this work.

"Going to start soon?" asked Mr. Durban, appearing in the doorway.

"Yes; why?" inquired Tom, who noted an anxious note in the voice of
the hunter.

"Well, I don't like staying longer in this jungle than I can help.
It's not healthy in the first place, and then it's a wild and
desolate place, where all sorts of wild beasts are lurking, and
where wandering hands of natives may appear at any time."

"You don't mean that the red pygmies will come back; do you?" asked
Ned.

"There's no telling," replied Mr. Durban with a shrug of his
shoulders. "Only, as long as we've got what we're after, I'd start
off as soon as possible."

"Yes, don't run any chances with those little red men," begged Andy
Foger, who had given himself up for lost when he and his companion
fell into their hands.

"Radder vould I be mit cannibals dan dose little imps!" spoke the
German fervently.

"We'll start at once," declared Tom. "Are you all aboard, and is
everything loaded into the airship?"

"Everything, I guess." answered Mr. Anderson.

Tom looked to the motor, saw that it was in working order, and
shoved over the lever of the gas machine to begin the generating of
the lifting vapor. To his surprise there was no corresponding hiss
that told of the gas rushing into the bag.

"That's odd," he remarked. "Ned, see if anything is wrong with that
machine. I'll pull the lever again."

The bank clerk stood beside the apparatus, while Tom worked the
handle, but whatever was the matter with it was too intricate or
complicated for Ned to solve.

"I can't see what ails it," he called to his chum. "You better have
a peep."

"All right, I'll look if you work the handle."

The passengers on the airship, which now rested in a little clearing
in the dense jungle, gathered at the engine room door, looking at
Tom and Ned as they worked over the machine.

"Bless my pulley wheel!" exclaimed Mr. Damon "I hope nothing has
gone wrong."

"Well something has!" declared the young inventor in a muffled
voice, for he was down on his hands and knees peering under the gas
apparatus. "One of the compression cylinders has cracked," he added
dubiously. "It must have snapped when we landed this last time. I
came down too heavily."

"What does that mean?" asked Mr. Durban, who did not know much about
machinery.

"It means that I've got to put a new cylinder in," went on Tom.
"It's quite a job, too, but we can't make gas without it!"

"Well, can't you do it just as well up in the air as down here?"
asked Mr. Durban. "Make an ascension, Tom, and do the repairs up
above, where we've got good air, and where--"

He paused suddenly, and seemed to be listening.

"What is it?" asked the young inventor quickly. There was no need to
answer, for, from the jungle without, came the dull booming of the
war drums of some natives.

"That's what I was afraid of!" cried the old elephant hunter,
catching up his gun. "Some black scout has seen us and is summoning
his tribesmen. Hurry, Tom, send up the ship, and we'll take care of
the savages."

"But I CAN'T send her up!" cried Tom.

"You can't? Why not?"

"Because the gas machine won't work until I put in a new cylinder,
and that will take at least a half a day."

"Go up as an aeroplane then!" cried Mr. Damon. "Bless my monkey
wrench, Tom, you've often done it before."

For answer Tom waved his hand toward the thick jungle all about
them.

"We haven't room to get a running start of ten feet." he said, "and
without a start the airship can never rise as a mere aeroplane. The
only way we can get up from the jungle is like a balloon, and
without the gas--"

He paused significantly. The sound of the war drums became louder,
and to it was added a weird singing chant.

"The natives!" cried Mr. Anderson. "They're coming right this way!
We must fight them off if they attack us!"

"Where's the electric rifle?" asked Ned. "Get that out, Tom!"

"Wait!" suggested Mr. Durban. "This is serious! It looks as if they
were going to attack us, and they have us at a disadvantage. Our
only safety is in flight, but as Tom says we can't go up until the
gas machine is fixed, he will have to attend to that part of it
while we keep off the black men. Tom, we can't spare you to fight
this time! You repair the ship as soon as you can, and we'll guard
her from the natives. And you've got to work lively!"

"I will!" cried the young inventor. "It's luck we have a spare
cylinder!"

Suddenly there was a louder shout in the jungle and it was followed
by a riot of sound. War drums were beaten, tom-toms clashed and the
natives howled.

"Here they are!" cried Mr. Anderson.

"Bless my suspenders!" shouted Mr. Damon. "Where is my gun?"

"Here, you take mine, and I'll use the electric rifle," answered the
elephant hunter. As he spoke there was a hissing sound in the air
and a flight of spears passed over the airship.

The defenders slipped outside, while Tom, with Ned to help him,
worked feverishly to repair the break. They were in a serious
strait, for with the airship practically helpless they were at the
mercy of the natives. And as Tom glanced momentarily from the
window, he saw scores of black, half-naked forms slipping in and out
among the trees and trailing vines.

Soon the rifles of his friends began to crack, and the yells of the
natives were changed to howls of anguish. The electric weapon,
though it made no noise, did great execution.

"I only hope they don't puncture the gas bag," murmured Tom, as he
began taking the generating machine apart so as to get out the
cracked cylinder.

"If they do, it's all up with us," murmured Ned.

After their first rush, finding that the white men were on the
alert, the blacks withdrew some distance, where their spears and
arrows were not so effective. Our friends, including Andy Foger, and
the German, kept up a hot fire whenever a skulking black form could
be seen.

But, though the danger from the spears and arrows was less, a new
peril presented itself. This was from the blow guns. The curious
weapons shot small arrows, tipped with tufts of a cottony substance
in place of feathers, and could be sent for a long distance. The
barbs were not strong enough to pierce the tough fabric of the gas
bag, as a spear or arrow would have done, but there was more danger
from them to our friends who were on deck.

"Those barbs may be poisoned," said Mr. Durban, "and in case any one
is wounded, the wound, though it be but a scratch, must be treated
with antiseptics. I have some."

This course was followed, the elephant hunter being wounded twice,
and Andy Foger and Mr. Damon once each. There was not a native to be
seen now, for they were hiding behind the trees of the jungle, but
every now and then a blowgun barb would whizz out of the forest.

Finally Mr. Durban suggested that they erect improvised shelters,
behind which they could stand with their rifle, and breastworks were
made out of packing boxes. Then our friends were comparatively safe.
But they had to be on the alert, and it was nervous work, for they
could not tell what minute the blacks would rush from the jungle,
and, in spite of the fire from the electric rifle and other guns,
overwhelm the ship.

It was very trying to Tom and Ned, for they had to work hard and
rapidly in the close engine room. The sweat dripped down off them,
but they kept at it. It was three hours before the broken cylinder
was removed, and it was no light task to put in the other, for the
valves had to be made very tight to prevent leakage.

The two lads stopped to get something to eat, while the guards kept
sharp watch against a surprise. At intervals came a flight of barbs,
and occasionally a black form could be seen, when it was instantly
fired at. Several times the barbaric noise of the tom-toms and war
drums, with which the shouts of the natives mingled, broke out
deafeningly.

"Think you can repair it by night?" asked Mr. Durban anxiously of
Tom.

"I hope so," was the response.

"Because if we have to stay here after dark--well, I don't want to
do it if I can help it," finished the hunter.

Neither did the young inventor, and he redoubled his efforts to make
the repairs. It was getting dark when the last belt was in place,
and it was high time, too, for the natives were getting bolder,
creeping up through the forest to within shooting distance with
their arrows and spears.

"There!" cried Tom at length. "Now we'll see if she works!" Once
more he pulled the starting lever, and this time there was the
welcome hiss of the gas.

"Hurrah!" cried Ned.

The young inventor turned the machine on at full power. In a few
minutes the Black Hawk trembled through her length.

"She's going up! Bless my balloon basket! She's going up!" cried Mr.
Damon.

The natives must have suspected that something unusual was going on,
for they made a sudden rush, yelling and beating their drums. Mr.
Durban and the others hurried out on deck and fired at them, but
there was little more need. With a bound the airship left the earth,
being rapidly carried up by the gas. The blacks sent a final shower
of spears after her, but only one was effective, slightly wounding
the German. Then Tom started the motor, the propellers whizzed, and
the Black Hawk was once more under way, just as night settled over
the jungle, and upon the horde of black and howling savages that
rushed around, maddened over the escape of their intended victims.

No further accidents marred the trip to the coast, which was reached
in due time, and very glad our friends were to be away from the
jungle and the land of the red pygmies.

A division was made of the ivory, and Tom's share was large enough
to provide him with a substantial amount. Ned and Mr. Damon were
also given a goodly sum from the sale of the tusks. The big ones,
from the "rogue," were shipped to the man who had commissioned Mr.
Durban to secure them for him.

"Well, now for home," said Tom, when the airship had been taken
apart for shipment. "I guess you'll be glad to get back to the
United States, won't you, friends?"

"That's what," agreed Andy Foger. "I think I'm done with airships.
Ugh! When I think of those red dwarfs I can't sleep nights!"

"Yah, dot iss so!" agreed the German.

"Well, I'm going to settle down for a time," declared Tom. "I've had
enough adventures for a while, but those in elephant land--"

"They certainly put it all over the things that happen to some
people!" interrupted Ned with a laugh.

"Bless my fish-line, that's so!" agreed Mr. Damon.

But Tom Swift was not done with adventures, and what farther
happened to him may be learned by reading the next volume of this
series, which will be entitled, "Tom Swift in the City of Gold; or,
Marvelous Adventures Underground."

They all made a safe and pleasant voyage home, and as news of the
rescue of the missionaries had been cabled to America, Tom and his
friends were met, as they left the steamer, by a crowd of newspaper
reporters, who got a good story of the battle with the red pygmies,
though Tom was inclined to make light of his part in the affair.

"Now for Shopton, home, Dad, Eradicate Sampson and his mule!"
exclaimed Tom, as they boarded a train in New York.

"And somebody else, too, I guess; eh?" asked Ned of his chum,
with a laugh.

"That's none of your affair!" declared Tom, as he blushed,
and then he, too, joined in the merriment.

And now, for a time, we will say good-by to the young inventor
and his friends.
